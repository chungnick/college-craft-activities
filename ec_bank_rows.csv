Global Youth Program - Public Finance and Society,University of Pennsylvania Wharton,"Public Finance is the study of how government taxes and expenditures affect the economy and how these government programs should be designed. Public finance professors teach their students about how government taxes and expenditures affect the economy.

Business, government, and society are deeply interconnected, each influencing and shaping the others. Future business leaders must be skilled in policy analysis and able to incorporate policy issues seamlessly into their overall management approach. Even in the most capitalist and de-centralized economies, the government plays a significant role. In some sectors, such as education, the government may serve as the primary provider. In others, the private sector may operate as the provider, while the government takes on a key role as the payer. The government also acts as a safety net and, in all systems, collects revenue to fund defense, its own operations, and other obligations. 

In this course, we will explore the role of the government in various markets. We will start with understanding core microeconomic concepts, such as supply and demand, externalities, and public goods. Then, we’ll apply these models to explore why governments intervene in markets and examine the range of possible policies.  

This intensive two-week summer program is designed for a select group of high school students currently enrolled in 9th to 11th grades. Working in small groups, you will examine specific policy solutions used in different countries, assess their effectiveness, create a system that reflects your own ideals and values, and pitch it for a vote. 

All participants who successfully complete the program will earn a Wharton Global Youth Certificate of Completion.     

Wharton Public Finance and Society students will:

Build a strong foundation in microeconomics, exploring concepts like competitive markets, government intervention, externalities, and public goods — and see how they shape everyday life
Examine the critical role of government in markets, learning how policies influence citizens, businesses, and global economies
Apply game theory models and economic frameworks to better understand the strategic decisions of individuals, firms, and governments
Engage in hands-on case studies, simulations, and group activities that bring economic theories to life and connect them to real-world policy challenges
Collaborate with peers to research and design government policy solutions, building teamwork, analytical, and communication skills in the process

CCRI - Land,NASA,"For this project, students will perform a local, intensive, and comprehensive surface energy balance data collection and processing initiative that will help to characterize the urban heat island, the heat index, and more particularly the land surface temperature over various local community built and natural environments. The project aims to produce high temporal and spatial resolution land surface temperatures for the local community and for New York City using the combination of satellite remote sensing observations and ground-based measurements. Students will obtain remote sensing data from multiple polar orbiting and geostationary satellites. Additionally, students will use infrared cameras and flux tower instruments to understand how urban surfaces react to solar radiation and its consequent heat. Students will be able to monitor the incoming and outgoing radiation and heat energy components using the cameras. The differences between traditional rooftop materials and new green or white roofs will be explored. Moreover, hand held temperature measuring devices, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and observations from satellite infrared observations will be collected. Using statistical approaches and data processing, the gaps in temporal and spatial coverage appropriate for the development of a heat index (effect of air temperature + humidity) will be filled.

About us
 

Technology is the fastest way to innovate solutions to humanity’s biggest challenges. But right now, young people in underserved communities are systematically denied access to tech and AI education because of geography, gender, and privilege. When those closest to the problem are excluded from solution-building, the world loses transformative solutions, untapped economic power, and brilliant talent that could reshape our future.

Investing in Innovation

Technovation empowers young innovators around the world to become leaders, technology innovators and real-world problem solvers.

Technovation has been pushing the boundaries of education and innovation for almost 20 years. From the beginning, our focus has been on staying agile and preparing students for the technologies shaping the future.

This track record of innovation has shaped who we are today: the world’s largest technology accelerator for young people and one of the largest global communities of alumnae, mentors, and ambassadors.

Our recipe? Analyze, execute, prepare for tomorrow.

Evidence-based evolution. We don’t guess what works. We rigorously analyze learning data, collaborate with diverse researchers, and recalibrate our curriculum based on what the evidence tells us.
Community-powered impact. Our network of local organizations, mentors, and ambassadors understand what their communities need. They help us stay relevant, bringing real-world insights that keep our approach grounded and responsive.
A lifetime of support. Our alumnae don’t just graduate—they return as mentors, advocates, and innovators themselves, creating a living feedback loop. They show us where the world is heading because they’re building it.
Our Impact

Users icon
300,000 students across 160+ countries

Users icon
Global network of over 80,000 mentors and volunteers

Users icon
21,000 startup ideas

Our Promise

Technovation doesn’t stop at sparking interest in STEM—we are committed to breaking down barriers and expanding access for all our participants and community members. We focus on:

Resources: Expanding access to material, human, and social support systems.
Agency: Building participants’ abilities, confidence, and voice at home, school, work, and in their communities.
Achievements: Driving meaningful improvements in well-being and life outcomes that come from increased agency and cognitive skills (Kabeer, 1999).
A Movement of Innovators

The impact of this model is best told through the journeys of our alumnae.

Take Aruzhan Koshkarova from Kazakhstan. As a teenager, she created QamCare, the country’s first personal security app, ensuring women could quickly alert trusted contacts in moments of danger. Winning the Technovation grand prize in 2017, she proved that local solutions could drive global change - and today, as a software engineer, she continues building tools that keep communities safe.

Our Story
Technovation began in 2006, when Tara Chklovski – then a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at USC – saw a way to change the world. She believed education could break the link between where you’re born and what you can achieve, and that STEM offered a powerful pathway to unlock that potential. Driven by this conviction, Tara founded Iridescent (now Technovation). The name “Iridescent” reflected her vision: when you understand the science and engineering behind how the world works, fear gives way to curiosity, and everyday things reveal new layers of beauty. A flower, for example, becomes breathtaking not only for its colors, but for the physics that makes it bloom. The world, in turn, becomes brighter, more colorful – iridescent. Iridescent’s goal was to bring the most cutting-edge technologies and engineering marvels to underserved communities so that they would be inspired and equipped to become inventors and innovators.

Our first program, Family Science, began in 2006 at a single school in Los Angeles. From there, it spread across Southern California and eventually to San Francisco and New York. In 2010, we launched Technovation Girls. For almost 13 years we experimented intensely, running different types of programs with students of all ages, gender and from all communities across the world. For each program we collected and analyzed learning data to see which one was resulting in the deepest and most durable impact. One program quickly rose to the top – which was Technovation girls. Over the course of a rigorous three-month curriculum, students worked in teams – guided by a mentor – to identify a pressing problem in their community and design a technology solution to address it. They tested their ideas with real users, refined their prototypes, and built a robust business plan to bring their solutions to market.

Multi year longitudinal studies showed that the model was the most cost-efficient way of helping students develop durable identities as problem solvers. For just $250 – about $4 an hour – a girl received 100 hours of a world-class, cutting-edge technology and entrepreneurship curriculum, guided mentorship, and the chance to participate in a global program. Beyond those 12 weeks, she gained lifelong access to a vibrant alumna community of innovators and leaders, plus a prestigious certification of participation that helped unlock entry into top colleges.

Recognizing this, in August 2019 we committed fully to this model, changed our name to Technovation, and focused on scaling the program with the greatest proven impact. Today, Technovation is the only global program with longitudinal data proving the effectiveness of this approach. But the impact goes far beyond the numbers: students don’t just learn skills—they are transformed. They develop a lasting identity as problem-solvers, innovators, and leaders. Our alumnae are now running startups, pioneering new technologies, and driving progress as leaders across industries and communities worldwide. And what makes this transformation possible is not just the skills we teach, but the mindset we cultivate—the conviction that anyone, anywhere, can be an innovator.

The Technovation Girls Competition takes place at the end of the Technovation Girls season.

Teams work on their projects throughout the Technovation Girls season and, if they are eligible to compete and choose to do so, submit them to a global competition for the opportunity to win awards and educational scholarships.

Submissions are then judged in Quarterfinal, Semifinal, and Final rounds, with top-scoring teams advancing to subsequent rounds. Quarterfinals may be judged at in-person Regional Pitch Events or online. Semifinals are judged entirely online.

The Final round of the competition is held at World Summit, where Finalist teams (5 from each division), pitch their projects to a panel of judges.

While the Technovation Girls competition is not open to boys or participants above the age of 18, the curriculum is free and available to use by learners of all ages and genders.

All teams who submit to the competition are required to agree to the Honor Code when they submit. This agreement is made on the my.technovationchallenge.org platform, but the full text of the Honor Code can be found below for review.",https://technovationchallenge.org/competition/,1b0e1af3-5488-4568-92da-1f29f0cade08,"[""Remote""]",[],[],"[""Computer Science""]","[""Domestic Students"",""International Students""]",true,true,2026-01-06 21:33:38.311+00,"Technovation is a global technology accelerator and extracurricular program that empowers young people, particularly girls, to become leaders and problem-solvers through STEM and AI education.

International Relations Scholars Program,Harvard University,"About the Program

The Harvard University International Relations Scholars Program (HUIRSP) is a multi-day virtual conference for high school students who are interested in pursuing a career in foreign policy. This conference aims to reach students worldwide of diverse nationalities, socioeconomic classes, and lived experiences. HUIRSP provides participants with the unparalleled opportunity to explore pressing foreign policy subjects and engage in rigorous analytical assignments. Programming includes discussions with leading academics, policymakers, government officials, and regional experts. Students will gain skills in policy writing and cross-cultural leadership, and explore how to address global challenges from all sectors of international relations. There are two annual iterations of HUIRSP: the Summer Program (June of each year) and the Winter Intensive (January of each year). Students apply to HUIRSP on an individual basis.

The Policy Lab

Each iteration of HUIRSP offers participants the opportunity to participate in a Policy Lab. The Policy Lab offers a transformative experience for students, immersing them in a high-stakes simulation that mirrors the complexities of international policymaking. In this virtual lab, students are divided into teams, with each team representing different global actors, such as governments, international organizations (e.g., the United Nations), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or multinational foundations (e.g., the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Teams will be placed in separate Zoom rooms, each tasked with addressing a pressing global issue—such as climate change, public health, or economic development—from their unique perspectives. As they develop policy solutions, real-world developments will be introduced that will force teams to reevaluate their strategies. For instance, a war might break out in one region, or an outbreak of a contagious disease may shift the global agenda. These events, along with the decisions made by other teams in different rooms, will have direct consequences on each group’s ability to move forward with their policies.

Throughout the process, teams will receive supervision, advice, and guidance from current Board Members of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative; after the conference, top policy solutions may be shared with professors at Harvard University.",https://sites.harvard.edu/foreign-policy/ir-scholars-program/,2b1f942b-1458-4ed1-a938-ad339f7c8ed1,"[""Remote""]",[],"[""Paid""]","[""Law"",""Leadership"",""University""]","[""Domestic Students"",""International Students""]",true,false,,"The Harvard University International Relations Scholars Program (HUIRSP) is a virtual conference designed for high school students worldwide who are interested in pursuing careers in foreign policy and international relations.

MAA Invitational Competitions
Information Overview

Students who perform exceptionally well on the AMC 10 or AMC 12 are invited to continue participating in the MAA AMC series of examinations that culminate in the selection process for the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team.
Invitational Competition Sequence

The first in this series is the American Invitational Mathematics Exam (AIME), followed by the USA Mathematical Olympiad and Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO and USAJMO).

The top USAMO and USAJMO participants are invited to the Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) in the summer after the competition for mathematical development.

Based on testing at MOP, a select group of students is invited to participate in the Team Selection Tests (TSTs), a series of exams to determine the teams that will represent the USA at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO).

American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)

The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a challenging competition offered for those who excelled on the AMC 10 and/or AMC 12.

Description: The AIME is a 15-question, 3-hour examination, in which each answer is an integer number between 0 to 999. The questions on the AIME are much more difficult than those on the AMC 10 and AMC 12. Top-scoring participants on the AIME are invited to take the USAMO or USAJMO.

AIME I vs. AIME II: The AIME is given on a primary date (AIME I), and an alternate date (AIME II) to accommodate those unable to participate in the AIME I. Students may only take the AIME once; any student who takes both the AIME I and II will be disqualified.

AIME Competition Timeframe:

Administered between 1:30 pm ET and 5:30 pm ET on Competition Day.
AIME Administration Resources:

The AIME II Registration Form and the Change of Venue Form are located under “Competition Resources” on the dashboard of the AMC Platform. Only competition managers may fill out these forms.

AIME II Registration Form: Students who qualify for the AIME will automatically be registered to take the AIME I. Competition managers who cannot administer the AIME I or have students who cannot take it on that date must register for the AIME II. Complete the AIME II Registration Form by the deadline stated in the form.
AIME Change of Venue Form: Students who qualified for the AIME must take either the AIME I or AIME II at the institution where they took the AMC 10 and/or AMC 12. If the competition manager is unable to offer AIME I or II or a student absolutely cannot take the AIME at the same competition location, it is the competition manager’s responsibility to make arrangements with a different competition manager for their student and complete the Change of Venue Form by the deadline stated in the form.
Competition Managers who are administering both the AIME I and AIME II have the ability to switch students between the two competitions on the AMC platform.

USA Mathematical Olympiad and Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO and USAJMO)

The United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO) are the national-level invitational competitions that serve as a key step in the International Mathematical Olympiad team selection process.

Description: The USAMO and USAJMO are six-question, two-day, 9-hour essay/proof examinations. The top-scoring AMC 12 participants (based on a combination of AMC 12 and AIME scores) are invited to take the USAMO. The top-scoring AMC 10 participants (based on a combination of AMC 10 and AIME score) are invited to take the USAJMO. 

The MAA AMC champions inclusivity within our program and competitions. As we work towards creating a mathematical community to empower students of all genders, we invite the top-scoring AMC girl-identifying students to our USAMO and USAJMO each year. These students are placed on an ambitious path to potentially qualify for MOP, EGMO, and ultimately the IMO.

USAMO and USAJMO Competition Timeframe:

Administered between 1 and 5:30 pm ET on each of two competition days.
USAMO and USAJMO Venues:

The USAMO/USAJMO will now be held only at select official testing sites. Qualifying students will be invited to register at a nearby site as soon as AIME scoring is complete.

Awarding: For the USAMO, the AMC awards Gold prizes to at least approximately 6%, Silver to at least approximately 12%, and Bronze to at least approximately 18% of competitors. For the USAJMO, we name winners and recognize approximately 20% of contestants. For both USAMO and USAJMO, each additional contestant with 14 points or more will receive an Honorable Mention distinction. Each year, the Student Selection Committee will decide the exact percentages and number of awards.

Professor Aerts has spent most of her career researching the structure and evolution of stars — especially the heaviest and brightest ones — pioneering studies in stellar rotation, convection and chemical-element transport. She has developed mathematical methods to identify non-radial stellar oscillations in spectroscopic data, and used machine-learning techniques to classify many kinds of variable stars using observations from the CoRoT, Kepler and TESS space missions. Among these objects, she has detected numerous so-called gravity-mode pulsators.

Constantina Theofanopoulou

Constantina Theofanopoulou is an Associate Research Professor at Hunter College, City University of New York, a Visiting Associate Professor at Rockefeller University and a Visiting Scholar at New York University. She is directing the Neurobiology of Social Communication lab, which is co-funded by both Hunter College and Rockefeller University. Her overall goal is to dissect the neural circuits of complex sensory motor behaviors that serve social communication, essentially, speech and dance, and to identify possible therapies for disorders that include deficits in these behaviors.
For her Ph.D., she worked on the neurobiology of the social reward mechanisms underlying speech, specifically on the role of oxytocin in vocal learning in songbirds and humans. This project led her to realize that the oxytocin/vasotocin field was suffering from an inconsistent gene nomenclature that was hampering translational research. To mitigate this, during her Post Doc (Rockefeller University), she used novel genomic methods and proposed how gene nomenclature should be revisited, aiming at a universal vertebrate gene nomenclature.

Cumrun Vafa

Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy, Harvard University

Some of our student's testimonials...
“[BeyondQuantum] was an opportunity of a lifetime! I got a bird’s eye view of Quantum Computing, Linear Algebra, and Quantum Mechanics through lectures conducted by Filip Bar, Sanskriti (Nikki) O., Vasudha Hemadribhotla other inspiring mentors. The best part was that I was able to implement all my newfound skills through a research project on Quantum Computational Chemistry titled ‘The Usage of VQE and QPE for Chemical Problems,’ where I collaborated with Verity G. under the guidance of Ms. Victoria Hazoglou. It was an enriching (and intensive!) experience that truly strengthened my love for technology and the Quantum realm!”

National High School Game Academy,Carnegie Mellon University,"The National High School Game Academy (NHSGA) facilitates focused, passionate, and dedicated high school students to experience six weeks of video game development using current gaming industry best practices. Sharing methods and paradigms used in Carnegie Mellon's Masters of Entertainment Technology (M.E.T.) graduate program, the NHSGA teaches an innovative blend of hands-on team projects combined with in-depth traditional classwork, lecture, and discussion to “level up” a student’s skills and design thinking. The program culminates with each team creating an original game prototype which often serves as a portfolio-quality piece for the student’s college application. Every student accepted to the program can expect to contribute to every area of game development while maintaining their faculty-defined role on a multidisciplinary team.
The summer begins with two weeks of intense class study. As a verification of competence, individual and team homework is assigned and evaluated as the student progresses through the curriculum. Students must demonstrate a viable set of skills and methodologies in order to advance to the team game-building phase of the program. It is essential that each team member is willing and able to fully contribute to the game-building process. 
With a curriculum designed to elevate a student’s rigor, working process, and discipline, the NHSGA prepares students for their transition to college. Students are encouraged to expand their own creative possibilities in a unique blend of collaborative college-level work. 
Program Expectations
Public Speaking and Communication Skills
Oral presentations and extensive teamwork/discussions are essential core components of this program. Students must be able and willing to fully engage in such activities with* or without accommodations. Students who cannot demonstrate the ability to meet this requirement may be asked to leave the program.
*Note: Accommodations are required to be approved by the Office of Disability Resources.

Attendance 
Students are expected to remain fully engaged throughout the six-week program, producing the quantity and quality of work required for meaningful team collaboration, attending in person every day, and arriving on time. If the student misses a critical number of days, regardless of the cause, or fails to complete the requisite quantity or quality of homework, this can result in removal from the program without a refund.
In the same vein, the NHSGA does not allow students to leave for other competitions or events, nor leave before the program is finished or arrive after it has begun.
Student Behavior and Social Media
We live in a world where online communication often allows for anonymity - participants can hide behind nicknames or screen names. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to disrespectful or inappropriate behavior.
The NSHGA enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy regarding student conduct in all forms of communication. Any student found to be disrespectful or inappropriate toward another Pre-College student - regardless of the platform or timing - will be immediately dismissed from the program without a refund.
Curriculum
Carnegie Mellon University’s teaching philosophy is that all students learn by doing. The NHSGA enthusiastically embraces that philosophy, and every student will be taught the skills needed to develop video games.
In the weeks leading up to their arrival, students are emailed questionnaires by the faculty to test their game development knowledge and ascertain their skill level.

Computer science has transformed biology and medicine, and the next generation of life scientists must be fluent in both generating data in the lab and interpreting it with powerful computational tools. Our program gives high school students a rare chance to explore this interdisciplinary frontier in a university setting.
Students tackle real research-inspired problems, from studying microbes in Pittsburgh’s local ecosystems to investigating the impact of COVID-19. After collecting samples in the field, they will isolate bacterial DNA, fragment it into millions of sequences, and analyze these sequences using the same approaches used by computational biologists worldwide.
Each day highlights the synergy between experimentation and computation. Half the day is spent in a hackathon, with students working in teams to code solutions to computational questions inspired by biology. The other half takes place in the lab, where students generate the very datasets they’ll later interpret with their own code.
Carnegie Mellon University, a global leader in automated science, gives students the chance to work with robotic laboratory equipment. Using tools like the Opentrons OT-2 liquid handling robot and custom automation platforms, our students will see firsthand how machine learning and artificial intelligence are reshaping how science is done.

Accelerated Learning Program (ALP)

The Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) admits high school students from Wisconsin, across the United States, and around the globe to engage in three immersive weeks of fast-paced, rigorous, and hands-on learning at the top-ranked University of Wisconsin–Madison. Through a single, non-credit course, students explore advanced academic content while participating in experiential education that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world application. ALP is designed to elevate each learner’s academic journey. Students may be able to coordinate with their schools to earn high school credit upon successful completion of the program. Limited need-based scholarships are available on a rolling basis to help ensure access for all qualified participants

This year, the Wisconsin International Precollege Academy will become a part of the Accelerated Learning Program as an academic track. This means students participating in WIPA would be a part of the ALP Program in the international college readiness track.

Why ALP

Summer offers many options for motivated high school students, but the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) at UW–Madison provides something truly special: the chance to live and learn on a world-class campus while diving deep into a subject of interest. Though UW–Madison is a large university, ALP creates a close, welcoming academic community where students can focus on one intensive course over three weeks. This immersive format allows for meaningful exploration, hands-on learning, and personal growth — opportunities that are often hard to find in a typical high school schedule.
ALP courses are taught by knowledgeable instructors who specialize in their subject areas and tailor material for high school students. Each class is designed to be accelerated and engaging, with a focus on creating a supportive and personalized learning environment. Small class sizes allow instructors to get to know students individually, helping them set learning goals and adjust coursework to be appropriately challenging. Courses begin with a pre-assessment to better understand each student’s strengths and background knowledge. Undergraduate/graduate teaching assistants also support the classroom experience, offering additional help and guidance throughout the program.
Time outside of class is thoughtfully planned and coordinated by residential staff. The residential experiences provides students the opportunity to connect with their peers through small and large group activities. Events and activities are intentionally hosted in and outside of  the dorm space to foster social and emotional growth. Students will be able to choose from art-focused, sport-related fun, Olympic-style challenges, and performative-based activities.
What to expect

Students are in class each weekday with a morning class session, an afternoon class session, and a required study session to finish up the academic day. Students should be prepared to interact, learn, and grow at an accelerated pace while exploring their chosen course topic. Students are encouraged to bring a sense of maturity and respect to all aspects of the program — from preparing for class and engaging in activities, to interacting with peers, staff, and the broader UW–Madison community. Students will be able to utilize campus resources and develop greater independence as learners, with support tailored to a variety of learning styles and strengths. By the end of the program, students often see growth in time management, project planning, and a deeper understanding of their interest, abilities and learning pathway preferences.
Residential students get a true taste of college life as they settle into UW–Madison’s vibrant campus community. From living in the dorms to exploring the university and nearby neighborhoods, every day brings new opportunities to connect, discover, and grow. Coordinated activities and free time create space for friendships to flourish. It’s more than just a place to stay — it’s a place to belong.
Commuter students participate in the program on weekdays, attending engaging academic sessions and returning home once the day concludes. While they don’t reside on campus, commuter students benefit from the full academic experience. This format allows students to immerse themselves in challenging coursework and build valuable skills, all while maintaining their home routines. With parent or guardian permission, they may arrange their own daily transportation to and from campus.

Accrue additional credits by enrolling again
Pre-baccalaureate courses are selected from across Wharton’s academic departments and are designed to instill a deep understanding of how business works. Courses are offered at the introductory level and convey the rigor and relevance of a Wharton undergraduate education.

Each course varies in specifics, though all courses include live, weekly class meetings offered on a synchronous basis. During live classes, students will participate in instructor-led lectures and course discussions. Additionally, live meetings may include business simulations, case studies, group projects, or individual assignments. Courses also incorporate some level of asynchronous content, which may include pre-recorded faculty lectures, readings, or assignments.

SMALL CLASS ENVIRONMENT

Courses are made up entirely of high school students in the Pre-baccalaureate Program. All courses are taught by Wharton instructors and class sizes are small to facilitate student engagement and foster dynamic conversations.

UNDERGRADUATE-LEVEL ASSESSMENT

Pre-baccalaureate students are graded on attendance and course participation, quality of assignments, and formal assessments such as quizzes, midterms, and final papers or exams. Attendance at live class meetings is mandatory, as is the completion of all assigned coursework.

Each student is initially registered to receive a traditional letter grade (A–F) for coursework. Upon consultation with an academic advisor, and in accordance with academic policies and deadlines, students may change to a Pass/Fail grading status if deemed necessary.

COLLEGE CREDITS

Upon successful completion of the program and all included therein, Pre-baccalaureate students will generate official University of Pennsylvania/Wharton transcripts outlining courses completed, grades earned, and college credits received, which are transferable to most universities and colleges.

Each Wharton Pre-baccalaureate course awards 0.5 University of Pennsylvania course units, which is equivalent to 2 college credits at most post-secondary institutions. Students may enroll in a maximum of two courses per session, and may continue to enroll in courses and earn credits in subsequent sessions until they graduate from high school, as long as they maintain good academic standing.

ACADEMIC SUPPORT

To assist in academic studies, Pre-baccalaureate students are granted access to university learning resources, including research catalogs, library services, instructor office hours, and academic advising.

Every student is assigned an academic advisor upon admission. This individual will serve as the student’s primary program contact and will assist students in navigating university resources, adhering to academic policies and deadlines, and identifying suitable courses. All students will receive an introductory email from their advisor prior to the start of the program and will be invited to attend an introductory advising session, as well as new student orientation, via video conference. Students can feel free to meet with their advisors as often as needed.",https://globalyouth.wharton.upenn.edu/pre-baccalaureate-program/,54e26a42-2786-4991-99c1-cd828e77d0f4,"[""Remote""]","[""Pennsylvania""]","[""Paid""]","[""Business"",""University""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,true,2026-01-06 19:58:32.579+00,"The Wharton Pre-baccalaureate Program provides high school juniors and seniors with the opportunity to earn college credits by enrolling in introductory business courses taught by Wharton instructors.

Wharton Global High School Investment Competition,University of Pennsylvania Wharton,"The Wharton Global High School Investment Competition is a free, experiential investment challenge for high school students (9th to 12th grade) and teachers. Students work in teams of four to six, guided by a teacher as their advisor, and have access to an online stock market simulator. Together, they learn about strategy-building, teamwork, communication, risk, diversification, company and industry analysis, and many other aspects of investing.

Teams examine a short case study featuring a potential client (a real Wharton graduate working in business) and are tasked with collaborating to meet that client’s long-term investment goals as they try to win his or her business. Equipped with the Wharton Investment Simulator (WInS), which allows them to buy and sell stocks and ETFs, over the course of 10 weeks students develop an investment strategy, analyze industries and companies, and build a portfolio using $500,000 in virtual cash. Winners are selected on the strength and articulation of their team strategies, not on the growth of their portfolios, which is a key differentiator between this investment challenge and others. During the competition each team submits two deliverables.

Final reports are reviewed by a team of judges, who select 50 semifinalist teams. Those teams are invited to present their strategies to a panel of expert judges at the virtual Semifinals.

Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program (ASDRP),Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program (ASDRP),"The Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program (ASDRP) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research & development (R&D) institution that provides opportunities for high school students throughout the Bay Area, especially those who are underrepresented in STEM or who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, to conduct high-level novel scientific research. As the premier precollegiate research establishment in the Bay Area, ASDRP is committed to both producing state-of-the-art research year round, and serving the diverse community in which we are located.
Students participate in research projects across various subjects in STEM, including chemistry, biology, computational modeling, computer science, and much more. Students publish and present their work as well in venues within and outside of ASDRP. Research in ASDRP is supervised by highly skilled scientists  and engineers on the research faculty, who are clustered under one of three departments - Biological/Human/Life Sciences, Chemistry/Biochemistry/Physics, or Computer Science & Engineering. Click on the Research tab above to learn more about each department. We function much like any other research establishment in industry or in academia: we pursue challenging and novel research questions, we make discoveries, and we publish papers and present work at conferences.  But there's one catch - the science is in the hands of high school students. 
ASDRP provides students with research mentors and over $4M worth of research equipment in our research laboratory (for more information, please see our Facilities page). Students are matched with research mentors who have experience in academia or industry in their particular field; together, they design a research project. These projects are not science experiments in which the results are known a priori, but rather are original research projects that expand current scientific knowledge. Students execute research projects, learn scientific reading and writing skills, write research papers on their results, undergo mock peer-review, publish their research papers in the ASDRP Communications online journal, and give poster presentations at the end-of-summer expo. Students additionally publish and present their work in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. We follow up with students from ASDRP to help place them into university research laboratories and industry internships in subsequent summers. The inaugural cohort of ASDRP started in summer 2018.
​
We invite you to read more about our facilities and program model throughout this website. You can access student research papers on the Journal page, peruse the various projects and disciplines in which students conduct research, learn more about our facilities, and more.
 
ASDRP is a translatable model for increasing interest in, and exposure to, novel scientific research among high school students, especially those who are underrepresented in STEM. ASDRP is a production of Olive Children Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in Fremont, CA.

Some of our student's testimonials...
“Overall I really liked the way the programme was structured. I liked how the knowledge gained from each session felt connected. Overall I also really liked the teaching and intuition of the topics taught. It made AI as a concept feel more approachable. I remember looking up some these topics prior the programme and feeling intimidated. But the way it was taught here felt very natural, and was much easier to understand.”

Most of a typical RIBS day is spent in lab with lectures given when needed to provide background and context for the experiments. Communication skills are important in science. RIBS students will have weekly writing assignments, and will keep a detailed lab notebook. We will read original research articles and students will participate in group presentations. Students will also attend weekly lunch time seminars given by research faculty.

The course ends with a research forum in which the students present the results of their projects. Successful completion of the course will give participants the experience and confidence to work in a research laboratory.

Course Criteria

High school biology is required. Students tend to be more successful in this course when they have completed one year of an advanced biology course and attained a strong grade in the course. Students who have completed a significant amount of lab work outside of class may find this course repetitive.

About Rice Architecture Summer Immersion Program
Architecture Student working on design project
The Rice Architecture Summer Immersion program, offered in collaboration with the Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM), is designed for Houston-based current (2025-2026 school year) 10th- and 11th-grade students interested in applying to architecture school. This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the principles of architecture and design. Students test design concepts through several media and exercises in two and three dimensions.
The goal is to explore architectural space at a range of scales and to produce creative works that participants can integrate into a design portfolio, a necessary component in the college application process for architecture programs. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with Rice University faculty and current students, as well as practicing architects, to learn more about the field of architecture.
Summer 2026 Rice Architecture Summer Immersion Program*
The Rice Architecture Summer Immersion is a tuition-free thirteen-day/twelve-night residential program for current (2025-2026 school year) 10th- and 11th-grade students who are sixteen or older from targeted schools in the Greater Houston area. Participants will stay in a dorm room on the Rice University campus and have a roommate (roommates will be randomly assigned and grouped by gender). All campers will be in the same dorm building but remain in separate wings according to gender. Program staff members will be available at all hours in case of emergencies. Please verify the program dates and expectations for each session below.
The Rice Architecture Summer Immersion Program will take a hiatus during the summer of 2025 and return summer 2026.

Classes are taught by accomplished Carnegie Mellon University faculty and adjunct professors.
 
Choose from one of our three options below to prepare for an education and career in theater:
Acting Option: Acting students will focus on audition preparation and classroom training rather than a production, allowing students to enter the college application and audition process with a repertoire of monologues as well as the skills needed to find material appropriate for their age and type. Along with the core classes of Acting, Audition, Acting for the Camera, and Dramaturgy, students in the Acting option will also receive training in Movement, Shakespeare, and Voice & Speech. 
 
Design/Production Option: Students begin creating a cohesive portfolio upon which they can build for their college application process. They will be exposed to classes in Basic Design, Technical Production, and Stage & Production Management, as well as introductory work in Lighting, Sounds, Video/Media, Costumes, and Fabrication Technology. Additional supplementary subjects may be added and can change from year to year. All students in Pre-College Drama, including those in the Design/Production option, will take Dramaturgy.
Music Theater Option: Students focus on audition preparation and classroom training rather than a production, allowing students to enter the college application and audition process with a repertoire of monologues and songs, as well as the skills needed to find material appropriate for their age and type. Ballet and Jazz classes will provide inexperienced students with a dance foundation, while more experienced students will be placed with peers of similar ability allowing for further development. Music Theater students will also take classes in Acting, Audition, Acting for the Camera, Song Coaching, and Dramaturgy.

Global Youth Program - Data Science Academy,University of Pennsylvania Wharton,"Wharton Data Science Academy (WDS), launched in 2020, is an intensive pre-college program designed for curious, high-achieving students from around the world. The curriculum mirrors the rigor of upper-level Wharton undergraduate courses, while being taught in a way that is accessible to motivated high school learners. We start from the foundations, including data wrangling and visualization, fundamental probability and statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing), and core modeling (simple/multiple regression, classification, model assessment).

From there, we build steadily toward modern machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The curriculum has been evolving; we update modules with state-of-the-art topics such as neural networks and large language models (LLMs). Throughout, we emphasize not only technical skills, but also the responsible use of data, attention to bias and fairness, and the ability to communicate results clearly Coursework is hands-on, using R as the primary language, with selective use of Python (e.g., Colab) for deep learning and LLM. 

All participants who complete the program will earn a Wharton Global Youth Certificate of Completion.

What students can expect:

RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
AMRI High School Summer Research Program. AMRI has maintained a Summer Research Program for high school students since 2002. During this time, over 140 students have participated from high schools from all over the Greater New Orleans area. This unique 8-week full-time experience allows students to work side-by-side in modern research labs with nationally/internationally recognized scientists. The research areas can vary widely but often involve aspects of chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, psychology, and mathematics. The students are given their own research program or work as part of a larger team on a major focus of the host research group. These projects are exploratory giving the student experience in fundamental and applied research; recent projects have involved nanomaterials, sensor arrays, environmental remediation, 3-D printing, battery materials, catalysis, neuroscience, computer modeling, magnetic materials, and thin film deposition. Students not only work full time in the laboratory, but also participate in weekly seminars and tutorials in a number of areas including ethics, careers in materials science and related fields, effective management skills, laboratory safety, nanomaterials, electron microscopy, crystallography, magnets, and computational methods.

Historically, funding for this program has been varied. In the past, large major multi-investigator AMRI grants from DARPA, EPSCoR, and other sources included small funds to support this effort. More recently such funding sources have been limited, so the program has relied more on individual AMRI investigator grants (e.g. NSF) and AMRI's own resources to support 1 or more students. Most recently we have started a crowding funding campaign, looking to AMRI ""alumni"", business associates, faculty, friends and family to help support this important program. The summer stipend for this program is $2000 per student, where other costs for the program are covered by the PI's and AMRI.

This program has been very impactful over the years. While we have not been able to track all our participants, we know that several have gone on to obtain bachelor's degrees in the sciences and others have gone on to complete doctorates. Madalyn Radlaurer (Summer 2004) went on to complete a B.S. in Chemistry from Stanford University in 2008, a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Cal Tech in 2014, a postdoc at the University of Minnesota (2014-2017), and now she is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at San Jose State.

Summer Academic Research Experience,JHU,"The Summer Academic Research Experience (SARE) is a high school component of our Johns Hopkins Initiative for Careers in Science and Medicine.  SARE seeks to develop exceptional high school students from low-income (<200% of the federal poverty level) and educationally under-resourced (most commonly first-generation college or attends, or would have attended based on their home address, a high school where the majority are also low-income) backgrounds, by introducing them to biomedical research. The students who go through the program are known as “SARE Scholars”.  To date, 95% of our scholars who have reached college age have matriculated into college with nearly 100% receiving partial or full financial support.  SARE also has ≥64% college completion rate by four years post high school graduation, and a ≥77% college completion rate by six years post-high school graduation.  80% have graduated with degrees in STEM or medical-related majors (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medical-related sciences; STEMM).  These outcomes compare quite favorably to the 10-14% national college completion rate by six years post-college matriculation for students from socioeconomically under-resourced backgrounds. SARE provides its scholars with a unique exposure to modern scientific research, combined with additional tutoring to fortify academic skills. The rationale is that many low-income youth may not have had the opportunity to be exposed to environments where creative and critical thinking skills are emphasized, where substantial academic accomplishment is celebrated, and where colleagues of all levels are ready to help when one needs it. Laboratories within academic research universities cultivate this type of environment. Therefore, we leverage this environment and utilize our science in outreach to this younger group of students. While research universities already have many outreach programs, most target the undergraduate and post-baccalaureate levels. Through SARE, Johns Hopkins targets adolescents at a critical age in an intensive manner, allowing for substantial impact that will carry on through these students’ lives.",https://sare.cellbio.jhmi.edu/,8711f088-4e94-4871-bccb-0babd53a3c39,"[""In-Person""]","[""Maryland""]","[""Paid""]","[""Program"",""STEM"",""University""]","[""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,,false,[],[],

Botball Scholarship Competition,Botball,"The Botball Educational Robotics Program engages middle and high school students in a hands-on, team-based robotics competition that brings STEM to life. Students design, build, and program autonomous robots — no remote controls here! — using real engineering and coding skills aligned with today’s academic standards.
 
Botball inspires students through inquiry-based, learn-by-doing experiences that build creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork. By combining technical skill with collaboration, students develop the confidence and leadership needed to thrive in STEM careers.
 
Each season begins with Botball Educator Workshops in January through March, where teachers and mentors receive training and learn the details of the year’s game challenge. After a seven-week build period, teams head to regional tournaments to showcase their robots and compete for top honors.

There’s no driver in Botball — these robots think for themselves! Every move is powered by the students’ own programming and the robot’s sensors, which detect changes in light, distance, color, and other parameters to navigate the game board. Botball robots are fully autonomous, starting, stopping, and maneuvering completely on their own.
 
By designing, building, and programming their robots, students apply what they learn in the classroom — science, technology, engineering, math, and even language arts — in a hands-on, collaborative project that makes learning meaningful, memorable, and fun.

Every Botball team receives a KIPR Wombat robot controller, LEGO® pieces, compatible metal parts, motors, servos, a variety of sensors, and a camera for computer vision — plus all the tools needed to build a functioning robot, no power tools or machine shop required.
 
This design keeps the playing field level for all teams, regardless of access to resources.
 
At the Educator Workshop, teams receive their reusable robotics kit, along with software, documentation, and details for the current season’s game. During the workshop, participants use their kit to build and program a demonstration robot, gaining hands-on experience before competition season begins.
After the workshop, teams have 7–9 weeks to:
🧠 Design, build, and program two autonomous robots using components from the Botball kit
💻 Document their innovation and creativity online through the Team Home Base
🌍 Connect and collaborate with students, teachers, roboticists, and hobbyists across the Botball community
🏆 Test, refine, and prepare for their regional tournament

The learning doesn’t stop when the season ends! In a recent survey, 86% of Botball team leaders reported using their Botball kit for educational activities year-round — proving its value far beyond the tournament.
Creative ways to use your Botball kit outside the season:
🧪 Integrate into the classroom — bring robotics into physics, technology, or computer science lessons
⚙️ Enhance existing activities — use sensors, motors, or components for hands-on lessons like simple machines or data collection projects
🚀 Host a fall mini-challenge — get students energized and ready for the upcoming Botball season
🔧 Encourage independent exploration — let students use the kit for science fairs, engineering projects, or personal innovation

Teachers who are confident using robotics to teach STEM can inspire and impact students for years to come. That’s why every Botball region hosts a hands-on professional development workshop designed and led by professional roboticists.
 
These workshops empower educators to guide students through the engineering design process while strengthening computational thinking and coding skills. The Botball curriculum aligns with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core Math Standards, giving teachers a structured, flexible framework for classroom success.
 
After the workshop, the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics continues to provide technical support and mentorship throughout the Botball season — ensuring teachers and teams have the tools they need to thrive.",https://www.kipr.org/botball,895f1dff-b964-45ba-b8e8-e4c6cb3cb5c8,"[""Remote"",""In-Person""]","[""All States""]","[""Paid""]","[""Competition"",""Engineering""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,"The Botball Educational Robotics Program provides middle and high school students with a hands-on, team-based competition where they design, build, and program fully autonomous robots that operate without remote controls.

IN THEIR WORDS 
Job Preparation
Practical Experience
The camp convinced me that I would find actuarial science interesting and that LVC had a strong program that would lead me to job opportunities. While there is a heavy math requirement in becoming an actuary, and it is easy to get wrapped up in the math course work, other skills like communication and programming are what will set you apart and get you a job. One of the most important skills to have is the ability to present complex information in a straightforward and engaging way.

Mathematics Camp,Stanford SUMaC,"Spend the Summer with Peers Who Share a Passion for Mathematics

SUMaC leads participants on a journey in advanced mathematics through lectures, guided research, and group problem solving. In an environment centered on mathematics, participants explore current lines of mathematical research, the historical development of important areas of mathematics, and applications across scientific disciplines.
Advanced Mathematics
Explore mathematics beyond the scope of what is typically taught in the classroom. SUMaC is for students who have an exceptional interest in mathematics, and who are prepared to study abstract algebra and number theory or algebraic topology.
Academic Enrichment
SUMaC courses are not for credit or grade—they are designed for pure mathematical enrichment.
Intensive Exploration
SUMaC focuses on mathematics that is motivated independently of ties to other sciences; nonetheless, important applications are introduced and pursued along the way.
College-Level Workload
Similar to what they would experience in a college course, participants can expect a heavy and engaging workload of assignments to complete outside of the live class meeting times.

Admissions is competitive. We receive many more qualified applicants for this small program than the space we have available. The residential program will serve 40 students and the online program will serve 64 students. SUMaC students are selected based on their grades in math courses, their teacher recommendation, their passion for mathematics as demonstrated in their essays and other parts of the application, their prior engagement with math both inside and outside class, and their performance on the SUMaC admission exam. 

Using the factors described above to determine the best fit, the Admissions Committee will place each admitted student in either the Program I course or Program II course. Most applicants accepted to Program II are very familiar with the material covered in Program I through prior participation in SUMaC or other study.

The admission exam is a collection of challenging proof-based math problems for applicants to work on at home over an extended period before the application deadline. If you are not familiar with the type of problems on the admissions exam, we invite you to consider applying to our Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes math courses: Number Theory or Discrete Mathematics. These courses will take place online. Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes requires a different application from SUMaC, but you can use the same account to begin and submit your application. The deadline to apply for Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes courses is March 13, 2026.

In addition to the online application form, a complete application includes: 

Academic Records
We require unofficial transcripts for each school or academic program from which you earned grades (such as letter or numerical grades) from Fall 2023 through Fall 2025. If you have multiple grade reports from one school, combine them into a single file for upload. Homeschooled applicants should submit a document similar to a transcript with their coursework from the years listed above. Homeschooled students should also submit transcripts from any graded courses they took with a school or program during this period. 
 
Teacher Recommendation
We require one online recommendation form from a math teacher.
 
Optional Video Essay
The video essay is an opportunity to share more about your interest in our program. You can consider it a conversation between you and our Admissions Committee. If you attend a school in which the primary language of instruction is a language other than English, we strongly encourage you to complete the video essay.
 
$65 Application Fee
You may submit the $65 application fee online using a credit card. See instructions for payment at the end of the Online Application. Fee waivers can be provided if qualifications are met.

Mathematics Program,Promys,"PROMYS is a six-week summer program in mathematics for strongly motivated high school students who are carefully selected from across the U.S. and around the world. Founded in 1989, PROMYS is a residential program held on the campus of Boston University with approximately 80 high school students and 25 undergraduate counselors.

Each weekday begins with all participants attending Number Theory lecture from 9:00–10:30 a.m. The main activity of first-year participants is their intensive efforts to solve an assortment of challenging problems in Number Theory. Daily problem sets encourage participants to design their own numerical experiments and to employ their own powers of analysis to discover mathematical patterns, formulate and test conjectures, and justify their ideas by devising their own mathematical proofs.

Each summer, returning students and motivated first-year participants take one or more of the Advanced Seminars offered on diverse topics. PROMYS faculty and visiting mathematicians lead the seminars which meet two or three times per week for lecture and also feature engaging problem sets. In 2024, we offered the following seminars: Discrete Dynamical Systems and the Poincaré Recurrence Theorem; Galois Theory; and Graphy Theory.

Our regular weekly activities are supplemented by diverse lectures by faculty and guests of the program. These lectures introduce participants to related scientific fields and include discussions of the ethics and philosophy of science, the relationship between pure and applied science, and career options.

All students have the opportunity to participate in the process of scientific research — PROMYS-designed exploration labs for first-year students and research projects mentored by professional mathematicians for returning students. Every summer, research mathematicians propose original problem statements for the PROMYS program. Each returning student selects a problem, then teams of four engage in open-ended exploration under the mentor's guidance. At the end of the summer, students write up and present their research to the entire PROMYS community. Some of these papers have been published or presented at conferences like the Joint Mathematics Meetings.

First-year students may also choose to participate in open-ended projects called Exploration Labs. They work in small groups, guided by a counselor and faculty member. At the end of the summer, the students write up their findings and make a presentation of their research to the assembled PROMYS community.",https://promys.org/programs/promys/for-students/,ba21ba03-b4d3-4bb7-8e81-94a647b2bc80,"[""In-Person""]","[""Massachusetts""]","[""Free""]","[""Mathematics""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,"PROMYS is a six-week summer mathematics program designed for approximately 80 highly motivated high school students and 25 undergraduate counselors from across the globe.

Art & Design Pre-College,UChicago,"Evolution, as it is understood by biologists and other scientists, refers to the process of generational change in the inherited characteristics of life forms. But it is also a powerful idea with ongoing significance for debates about human nature and the human relationship to nonhuman life and technology. Since its development in the nineteenth century, the idea of evolution has motivated countless writers, scientists, philosophers, and artists to imagine and advocate for diverse visions of the future of human life on earth and beyond. In this class, we will consider a variety of engagements with evolutionary thought—ranging from the construction of political utopias to programs in genetic manipulation and biohacking to efforts at preserving the past and future of endangered species. In so doing, we will analyze the history of evolutionary speculation, consider the ethical values associated with the various scientific, social, and cultural projects it has inspired, and develop the critical skills needed to tackle questions raised by developments in science and technology.",https://summer.uchicago.edu/course/art-and-design-age-internet,bb6ffe3a-0394-404b-b862-dd8424327bd1,"[""In-Person""]","[""Illinois""]","[""Paid""]","[""Program"",""Art"",""University""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,,false,[],[],

World Historian Student Essay Competition,WHA,"WHA 2026: Closed Borders and Global Connections: Being Global after Globalization

The WHA will be hosting the 35th WHA Annual Meeting in Incheon, Korea, from 25- 27 June, 2026, co-sponsored by George Mason University Korea. Please visit the conference website for more details!

Conference Theme

Closed Borders and Global Connections: Being Global after Globalization

The world is changing, and the discipline of World History must respond to those changes.

In the 2005 article “Myths, Wagers, and Some Moral Implications of World History,” one of the founders of the World History Association, Jerry Bentley, noted that the world has been moving towards a state of globalization as long as the field has existed, noting that the general narrative is that “the intensity and range of cross-cultural interactions has generally increased over time.” Yet he also praised modern historical scholarship for its “openness to examination and criticism from all angles.” The world history he called for, he writes, “does not pretend to know the end of history.”

Indeed, we find ourselves today in a world that many world historians did not predict: one that remains intensely interconnected through trade, migration, culture, and shared planetary futures, while globalization as a narrative and as a political project has faltered. Nationalism, protectionism, deportations, and regional conflict have all surged in ways that challenge the logic of global integration. In teaching and scholarly work alike, this reality asks us to rethink what it means to teach and study the global past in a world that no longer embraces globalization as an ideal or inevitability.

The Program Committee of the 35th Annual Meeting of the World History Association, to be held in Incheon, Korea in 2026, invites proposals that explore this new terrain. We ask: how can we write, teach, and think about world history in a moment characterized both by global entanglement and anti-globalist politics ? What historical precedents —such as empires, invasions, epidemics, diasporas, trade routes, or cross-cultural encounters—might help us imagine a world that is connected but not necessarily globalized in the modern sense? What models of both interconnection and interdiction have emerged or persisted outside the framework of globalization? And how might the changing present force us to rethink historiographical frameworks about the past?

Call For Proposals

You can submit your proposal(s) on our PreTalx submission site.

We especially welcome proposals that engage with Korea and Asia more broadly—not only as historical sites of cross-border connection, but also as important contemporary vantage points from which to rethink the global. Topics may include the history of Asian trade and exchange, transimperial and migration history, religion and cultural exchange, ecological frameworks, and communication infrastructures. We are particularly interested in papers that center Asian experiences and perspectives on global connectivity. We also encourage presentations that focus on models and lessons for the world from Korea, including in the realms of democracy, energy, and climate change.

We encourage submissions from scholars at all career stages and from all regions of the world. The WHA remains committed to fostering inclusive and accessible scholarly exchange, and we recognize that geopolitical and institutional barriers—including those involving visas, funding, and travel—affect scholars differently.

Proposals may take the form of:

Organized Panels (three to four panelists, one chair, and optionally, one discussant) - each paper should be a maximum of 20 minutes in length for three panelists; papers should be a maximum of 15 minutes in length for four panelists
Individual Papers (not part of an Organized Panel) - each paper should be a maximum of 20 minutes in length
Roundtable Sessions (between four to six participants) – five-minute opening statements from each participant followed by conversational dialogue with the audience
Workshop Sessions (between one to four participants) – these are hands on sessions on specific teaching techniques or practices that often include handouts, breakout sessions and/or assignment creation/reflection
Meet the Author Sessions - an excellent opportunity for exchanges between authors and audiences, including explanations of methods and suggestions for use
Innovative Sessions - innovative teaching, research, or other formats not outlined above Proposals from the fields of anthropology, geography, political science, literature, art history and criticism, digital humanities, other humanities and social sciences, as well as natural or physical sciences that address global historical change are also encouraged.
Lightning Round - These are five minute presentation slots intended to give brief summaries or introductions to relevant topics.
Each organized session should include a 250-word panel proposal and a 250-word proposal for each paper along with a short biographical statement for introduction by the session Chair. Individual papers and all other sessions should include a 250- word abstract and a short biographical statement for introduction by the session Chair.",https://thewha.org/conferences/korea-wha.html,c2bfb427-e36a-47f9-b144-2eb9511701cd,"[""In-Person""]","[""International""]","[""Registration Fee"",""Paid""]","[""Competition"",""Humanities"",""Writing""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,true,2026-01-05 22:01:58.065+00,"The World History Association, co-sponsored by George Mason University Korea, is hosting its 35th Annual Meeting centered on the theme ""Closed Borders and Global Connections: Being Global after Globalization.""

Lumiere Research Scholar,Lumiere Education,"Founded by Harvard and Oxford researchers, the Lumiere Research Scholar Program helps students work 1-on-1 with a Ph.D. mentor to learn about the cutting edge in their field of interest and produce an independent research project.

Our students have gone on to join the world's best universities, start non-profits, and represent their countries in global competitions.

Stephen and I met in a research program very similar to Lumiere. The program was a summer program for Harvard undergraduates where you work 1-1 with professors and graduate students on research. Stephen and I lived in the same dorm, ate lunch together, and even went on weekend trips around Boston. 
 
I don’t think we realized, at the time, how much that program would change both of our lives. For me, it would cement an excitement about doing research and asking questions that matter for the world. It’s ultimately why I would apply to Oxford and the Rhodes Scholarship. For Stephen, it kindled his desire to do research and come back to HBS one day. Perhaps most importantly, we also met each other and, in doing so, planted the seed for Lumiere. 
 
Lumiere’s mission is to provide world-class research opportunities for students around the world. That mission comes from the experience we both had together. It seeks to ensure that the opportunities we were given, received due to luck as much as anything, are not hidden in Ivory towers, but shared for the world’s best students.   
 
Our friendship is now more than half a decade old, and as it grows, so does Lumiere. We now have a community of hundreds of scholars and mentors in the program. Just like us, these mentors want to pay back the opportunities they received when they were younger. Just like us, the students seek out opportunities to prove themselves, as we did in that program. 
 
We hope you will join our story – as a mentor, scholar, team member, partner, supporter, or friend.

Writing & Culture,Carnegie Mellon University,"The idea of the attic-bound creative is a myth. Regardless of the medium, filmmakers and writers live their lives out in the world, not hidden behind closed doors.
In this program, students explore writing, film, and culture through traditional, historical, and contemporary lenses on CMU’s campus and throughout Pittsburgh. Over the weeks, students will produce a body of work anchored in digital poetics and short-form writing, film development and production, and preparatory materials setting a strong foundation in the humanities.
But this is not a Language Arts or Film Production course. By participating in this program, students will learn to think critically, express thoughts creatively, and communicate effectively for college and beyond. They will build a diverse body of work, moving through a series of written and visual formats and culminating in a short film. In the course of developing their stories, students will explore the continuum of both written and visual communication. 
Curriculum
Writing & Culture is an intensive program that introduces students to the range of ways to tell a story. Guided by the mentorship and instruction of the Department of English’s highly distinguished faculty members, students will produce and develop story ideas across a variety of formats and will consider the ways in which the medium affects the message. A poem prompts a short story. A short story is translated into a visual presentation. Both are developed into a screenplay, a scene of which is filmed. Each form alters the way the story is told and understanding that process is our central concern. Thinking about the best way to convey the story you want to tell is a crucial aspect of the humanities and is central to the development of a strong foundation in any discipline. Over the course of this experience, students will gain a toolkit that allows them to interpret written and visual stories with fresh eyes and anticipate different viewpoints.
This program provides highly individualized feedback and guidance, drawing on each student’s personal strengths and interests. Through the breadth of experiences in this program, students gather concepts and ideas, using them to fuel their own body of work.
Classes, meetings, and enrichment activities are held Monday through Friday with occasional special events on weekends.",https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/writing-and-culture.html,ca412df4-cbf0-40b1-996b-6de94da0fce1,"[""In-Person""]","[""Pennsylvania""]","[""Paid""]","[""Humanities"",""University"",""Writing""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,true,2026-01-06 00:56:43.035+00,"Writing & Culture is an intensive program where students explore storytelling through writing, film, and culture under the mentorship of distinguished faculty members.

CCRI - Climate Change,NASA,"Internships are educational hands-on opportunities that provide unique NASA-related research and operational experiences for educators and high school, undergraduate, and graduate students (age 16 and up). To learn more, visit https://intern.nasa.gov. Climate change has impacted all components of the environment, and the impacts on global lakes have been quite noticeable. There are over 100 million lakes on Earth (excluding those that are covered with glaciers), covering roughly 4% of the total land surface. Natural lakes and man-made reservoirs are essential sources of freshwater, and they provide inarguably important services to society. They are used for fresh drinking water, municipalities, recreational activities, and fisheries. Moreover, lakes play a major role in carbon sequestration and thereby are critically important for our planet. Many lakes have been desiccated by the adverse impacts of climate change, and their ensuing degraded water quality has led to major losses in economic and ecological value as they have now become significant societal and health risks. In addition to climate change desiccation, lakes are dying and degrading due to human mismanagement, point and non-point source pollution, and general loss. The extent and rate of global “lake-loss” is not fully understood. Therefore, many aspects of in-land water bodies require robust, comprehensive study and monitoring in order to achieve sustainable environments, habitats, economies, and agriculture. Spaceborne remote sensing observations with their unique spatial and temporal coverage have considerable capabilities for supporting investigations of the Earth system including in-land water bodies. This project, therefore, focuses on the application of satellite remote sensing and geographic information system techniques complimented by ground observations to study lakes and to provide insights about “lake-health” and about “lake-response” to the adverse impacts of climate change. Interns will obtain and analyze satellite data from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R), LandSat, ECOSTRESS, Sentinel 2A, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), etc.",https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001Qx9aEAC/ccri-monitoring-and-studying-lakes-from-space-in-a-changing-climate,ca6d8fdc-0fb1-4191-9165-014ec89378de,"[""In-Person"",""Remote""]","[""New York""]","[""Free""]","[""Program"",""STEM"",""Private""]","[""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,,false,[],[],

Junior Explorer,Lumiere Education,"Founded by Harvard and Oxford researchers, the Lumiere Research Scholar Program helps students work 1-on-1 with a Ph.D. mentor to learn about the cutting edge in their field of interest and produce an independent research project.

Our students have gone on to join the world's best universities, start non-profits, and represent their countries in global competitions.

Stephen and I met in a research program very similar to Lumiere. The program was a summer program for Harvard undergraduates where you work 1-1 with professors and graduate students on research. Stephen and I lived in the same dorm, ate lunch together, and even went on weekend trips around Boston. 
 
I don’t think we realized, at the time, how much that program would change both of our lives. For me, it would cement an excitement about doing research and asking questions that matter for the world. It’s ultimately why I would apply to Oxford and the Rhodes Scholarship. For Stephen, it kindled his desire to do research and come back to HBS one day. Perhaps most importantly, we also met each other and, in doing so, planted the seed for Lumiere. 
 
Lumiere’s mission is to provide world-class research opportunities for students around the world. That mission comes from the experience we both had together. It seeks to ensure that the opportunities we were given, received due to luck as much as anything, are not hidden in Ivory towers, but shared for the world’s best students.   
 
Our friendship is now more than half a decade old, and as it grows, so does Lumiere. We now have a community of hundreds of scholars and mentors in the program. Just like us, these mentors want to pay back the opportunities they received when they were younger. Just like us, the students seek out opportunities to prove themselves, as we did in that program.

College Summer Studies,HCSSiM,"HCSSiM is an intensive six-week encounter with college-level mathematics for talented and highly motivated high school students. It is demanding and expanding. Participants spend a major portion of each day actively engaged in doing mathematics (not simply learning the results of mathematics). HCSSiM students live in the dorms at Hampshire College in Massachusetts for six summer weeks, and study and play in its fields, woods, and academic buildings (not typically in that order). Typically, there are as many girls and non-binary students as boys.

The daily schedule includes 4 hours of morning classes (Mon-Sat), the pre-supper Prime Time Theorem, and evening problem sessions. Afternoons are devoted to reading, rest, recreation, occasional trips to town, and informal study. Participants have unparalleled access to faculty members in classrooms, at meals, and in the program dorm. Productive collaborations continue long after the program, and many lifelong friendships are forged.

Initially, Summer Studies participants will be partitioned into workshops, each led by a college or university professor and one or two graduate or undergraduate students. Each workshop will actively and intensively investigate problems from many areas of mathematics, with emphasis on unifying themes, recurrent patterns, and fruitful modes of inquiry. The particular topics are not predetermined by syllabus, but will be chosen by the instructors to challenge the interests and abilities of the participants. All students will have access to computer instruction (including Mathematica) during the workshop, and will be encouraged to use Hampshire’s facilities throughout the summer (but not for games or network cruising).

Midway through our six-week session, students and staff will regroup into “maxi-courses” and “mini-courses” for in-depth studies of particular problems and fields. Students will be able to select topics such as combinatorics, number theory, complex numbers, probability, four-dimensional geometry, fractals and chaos, graph theory, topology, and cellular automata.

Guest lecturers may include recent winners in the Siemens Competition, Intel Science Talent Search and other national competitions, authors of MAA and other contest problems, and other mathematicians from colleges, universities, and industry. We’ll have a weekly program of math films to teach, stimulate and to inspire.

The full cost of the Summer Studies will be $6511, ample financial aid is available based on need. Participants in the Summer Studies will not have time to maintain part-time jobs or similar obligations. There will, however, be a lot of program-related work; we keep our living and working places clean, we publish a weekly program journal, we show films, we organize trips, picnics, tournaments (in chess, Go, bocce, backgammon, frisbee…) and musical groups. Boredom has never been a complaint at the Summer Studies.

Neither grades nor credit are offered. Each student will be asked several times to evaluate his or her own growth; these introspections, together with evaluative comments by instructors, will form the basis for a report which will be made available, at the student’s request, to home schools, college admissions offices, and the like. Participants are also encouraged to make at least one mathematical presentation when they return to their schools.

Participants’ teachers are invited to visit the Summer Studies. Parental visits are discouraged, and other visitors require the approval of the Director eight months in advance.

Living Accommodations
Most of the faculty of the Summer Studies as well as all students will have single rooms in our dormitory. In the past summers, the continual close contact among students and staff has contributed greatly to the creation of a friendly, cooperative, and productive academic and social community.

The Hampshire College dining hall (“SAGA”) provides “all you can eat” at each meal. Students will have access to refrigerators and a stove. Students who are vegetarian, vegan, are easily accommodated. Though SAGA does not offer kosher food specifically, many past students have kept kosher during the summers and found the vegetarian and vegan options more than accommodating.

Recreation
Hampshire recreation facilities include the Robert Crown Center, as well as outdoor courts for volleyball, tennis, Tether Ball, and basketball; fields for soccer, Frisbee, and softball.

Our Sundays are spent relaxing or field-tripping to Boston, to the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood, or to other New England points of interest. These activities are regarded as parts of the program.

Participants are encouraged to bring bikes, musical instruments, athletic equipment, games, puzzles, calculators and computers (either laptop or desktop), and good working habits. Explosives, illegal drugs, firearms, cars, pets, noisy stereos, and sloppy thinking are not permitted.

The Hampshire College Admissions officers will be available for consultation, as will be representatives from other colleges and universities. Each summer, many alumni of previous HCSSiM’s pay visits and share experiences from their colleges and summer jobs.",https://hcssim.org/,d71a2299-0bc9-4814-9c8c-4af41eafd3de,"[""In-Person""]","[""New Hampshire""]","[""Paid""]","[""Program"",""Mathematics"",""Private""]","[""International Students"",""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,true,true,[],[],[]

Innovation in Music Academy,UCLA,"This program will give students a foundational overview of how the music business has been transformed by decades of technological and business innovation. Innovation led to music sampling and musical effects in hip-hop. The rise of music videos created a global, multicultural market for recorded music. Digitization created a renaissance for the industry and would later disrupt it entirely – first with Napster and then with iTunes. Today, streaming services like Spotify, Internet-connected devices, digital and mobile ticketing, and stadium technologies are radically changing the ways audiences consume and pay for music and music based experiences. This ongoing evolution continues to shape the business – impacting labels, artists, live event promoters and others pursuing careers in music.

Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (Riley Lab)

Our competitive Research Intensives program places high-achieving high school students in professional working labs alongside distinguished faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.

Research Intensive in the Antimicrobial Drug Discovery Lab (Riley Lab)

We live in the post-antibiotic era, which refers to the fact that bacterial pathogens harbor resistance to our most powerful antibiotics. In fact, by 2050, antibiotic resistant infections will be the leading cause of death in the world. The Riley Lab is hard at work discovering and developing a novel family of antimicrobials, the bacteriocins. These protein toxins are produced by most species of bacteria and are designed to narrowly target other members of the same species. This mode of action stands in sharp contrast to conventional antibiotics, which kill any bacteria present, including members of our precious microbiomes. Our microbiomes are critical in determining our health and antibiotics have wreaked havoc on these precious health-promoting symbionts.

If you join our lab you will be part of an exciting journey as we hunt for novel bacteriocin-based antimicrobials that eliminate the offending pathogens but leave our healthy microbiome intact. Current projects include development of a bacteriocin-based ointment to eliminate acne, the creation of bacteriocin-infused sutures to prevent surgical site infections, and the development of bacteriocin-coated catheters to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infections.

The Riley lab can host up to 18 students. Learn more. 

Program Overview

During this program, high school students will assist UMass faculty and graduate students in research labs while learning about research methodologies and contributing to ongoing research studies. Each student will create and present a research poster to faculty, fellow students, friends and family at a poster session at the end of the program.

Students will come away with an introduction to the field of Biology, firsthand experience with university-level research, and an understanding of opportunities that exist for undergraduate students at a major R1 university such as UMass Amherst.

 

Applications

For all Research Intensives applications: In your statement of interest, please include 3 lab choices from our list of available labs along with a brief explanation of your interest in each one.

This course is offered at the UMass Amherst campus as a residential program. Local students may apply to attend as a commuter.

AboutGet StartedRegistrationFinalsMore

American Computer Science League (ACSL) organizes computer programming and computer science contests for K-12 schools, organizations and local groups.  This year will be our 48th year of continuous operation! Last year, over 7,000 students from 21 countries on 6 continents  participated in the regular season competitions. Wow!!
ACSL offers multiple divisions, providing an appropriate challenge for students of varying ages and abilities.  An unlimited number of students may compete in each contest.
Each season is divided into four contests, testing students on fundamental concepts in computer science, ranging from Number Systems to Boolean Algebra to Digital Electronics.  In the upper divisions, each contest also includes a problem to solve by programming using Python, C++ or Java.
Contests are administered online.  Team advisors facilitate students’ access to the online platform; the platform corrects the submissions and reports the scores to ACSL.  Online resources assist advisors to prepare their students for each competition.  Each topic on the Study Materials page is linked to the page of the ACSL Wiki that describes the topic in detail. 
At the end of the year, the top students are invited to compete in an online Finals competition.
The All About the ACSL webinar is a great resource for prospective advisors, students, and parents.  It was prepared by Nathan Gorski, the advisor of the Bay Coding Club.

CCRI - Urban,NASA,"New, more detailed, and more accurate remotely-sensed data on urban areas and associated built-up surfaces can provide a foundation for a better understanding of the impacts of cities on their environment and potential improvements in the modeling of the impacts of urbanization on the energy/water/carbon cycles. The unprecedented level of spatial detail in these new data sets allows for a much improved and accurate characterization of the urban fabric (e.g., roads, buildings, open space), and their change, at a spatial scale that is directly relevant to cities and settlements and their inhabitants. This project will leverage existing and future NASA remote sensing assets to study in detail the direct connections between changes in the urban fabric and environmental changes in the Baltimore/Washington DC study area and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
