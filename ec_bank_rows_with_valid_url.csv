Students will obtain remote sensing data from multiple polar orbiting and geostationary satellites. Additionally, students will use infrared cameras and flux tower instruments to understand how urban surfaces react to solar radiation and its consequent heat. Students will be able to monitor the incoming and outgoing radiation and heat energy components using the cameras. The differences between traditional rooftop materials and new green or white roofs will be explored. Moreover, hand held temperature measuring devices, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and observations from satellite infrared observations will be collected. Using statistical approaches and data processing, the gaps in temporal and spatial coverage appropriate for the development of a heat index (effect of air temperature + humidity) will be filled.

AIM will test and inspire you. It will push you to your limits. You’ll rise early. You’ll study. You’ll compete. For six nonstop days, you’ll test your mind, body, and spirit in every way as you learn the meaning of college exceeded.

Intense and rewarding, AIM will help you to discover whether the Academy experience is truly what you want from college and whether you have what it takes to succeed.

Accelerated Learning Program (ALP)

The Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) admits high school students from Wisconsin, across the United States, and around the globe to engage in three immersive weeks of fast-paced, rigorous, and hands-on learning at the top-ranked University of Wisconsin–Madison. Through a single, non-credit course, students explore advanced academic content while participating in experiential education that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world application. ALP is designed to elevate each learner’s academic journey. Students may be able to coordinate with their schools to earn high school credit upon successful completion of the program. Limited need-based scholarships are available on a rolling basis to help ensure access for all qualified participants

This year, the Wisconsin International Precollege Academy will become a part of the Accelerated Learning Program as an academic track. This means students participating in WIPA would be a part of the ALP Program in the international college readiness track.

Why ALP

Summer offers many options for motivated high school students, but the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) at UW–Madison provides something truly special: the chance to live and learn on a world-class campus while diving deep into a subject of interest. Though UW–Madison is a large university, ALP creates a close, welcoming academic community where students can focus on one intensive course over three weeks. This immersive format allows for meaningful exploration, hands-on learning, and personal growth — opportunities that are often hard to find in a typical high school schedule.
ALP courses are taught by knowledgeable instructors who specialize in their subject areas and tailor material for high school students. Each class is designed to be accelerated and engaging, with a focus on creating a supportive and personalized learning environment. Small class sizes allow instructors to get to know students individually, helping them set learning goals and adjust coursework to be appropriately challenging. Courses begin with a pre-assessment to better understand each student’s strengths and background knowledge. Undergraduate/graduate teaching assistants also support the classroom experience, offering additional help and guidance throughout the program.
Time outside of class is thoughtfully planned and coordinated by residential staff. The residential experiences provides students the opportunity to connect with their peers through small and large group activities. Events and activities are intentionally hosted in and outside of  the dorm space to foster social and emotional growth. Students will be able to choose from art-focused, sport-related fun, Olympic-style challenges, and performative-based activities.
What to expect

Students are in class each weekday with a morning class session, an afternoon class session, and a required study session to finish up the academic day. Students should be prepared to interact, learn, and grow at an accelerated pace while exploring their chosen course topic. Students are encouraged to bring a sense of maturity and respect to all aspects of the program — from preparing for class and engaging in activities, to interacting with peers, staff, and the broader UW–Madison community. Students will be able to utilize campus resources and develop greater independence as learners, with support tailored to a variety of learning styles and strengths. By the end of the program, students often see growth in time management, project planning, and a deeper understanding of their interest, abilities and learning pathway preferences.
Residential students get a true taste of college life as they settle into UW–Madison’s vibrant campus community. From living in the dorms to exploring the university and nearby neighborhoods, every day brings new opportunities to connect, discover, and grow. Coordinated activities and free time create space for friendships to flourish. It’s more than just a place to stay — it’s a place to belong.
Commuter students participate in the program on weekdays, attending engaging academic sessions and returning home once the day concludes. While they don’t reside on campus, commuter students benefit from the full academic experience. This format allows students to immerse themselves in challenging coursework and build valuable skills, all while maintaining their home routines. With parent or guardian permission, they may arrange their own daily transportation to and from campus.

About Rice Architecture Summer Immersion Program
Architecture Student working on design project
The Rice Architecture Summer Immersion program, offered in collaboration with the Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM), is designed for Houston-based current (2025-2026 school year) 10th- and 11th-grade students interested in applying to architecture school. This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the principles of architecture and design. Students test design concepts through several media and exercises in two and three dimensions.
The goal is to explore architectural space at a range of scales and to produce creative works that participants can integrate into a design portfolio, a necessary component in the college application process for architecture programs. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with Rice University faculty and current students, as well as practicing architects, to learn more about the field of architecture.

RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
AMRI High School Summer Research Program. AMRI has maintained a Summer Research Program for high school students since 2002. During this time, over 140 students have participated from high schools from all over the Greater New Orleans area. This unique 8-week full-time experience allows students to work side-by-side in modern research labs with nationally/internationally recognized scientists. The research areas can vary widely but often involve aspects of chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, psychology, and mathematics. The students are given their own research program or work as part of a larger team on a major focus of the host research group. These projects are exploratory giving the student experience in fundamental and applied research; recent projects have involved nanomaterials, sensor arrays, environmental remediation, 3-D printing, battery materials, catalysis, neuroscience, computer modeling, magnetic materials, and thin film deposition. Students not only work full time in the laboratory, but also participate in weekly seminars and tutorials in a number of areas including ethics, careers in materials science and related fields, effective management skills, laboratory safety, nanomaterials, electron microscopy, crystallography, magnets, and computational methods.

Historically, funding for this program has been varied. In the past, large major multi-investigator AMRI grants from DARPA, EPSCoR, and other sources included small funds to support this effort. More recently such funding sources have been limited, so the program has relied more on individual AMRI investigator grants (e.g. NSF) and AMRI's own resources to support 1 or more students. Most recently we have started a crowding funding campaign, looking to AMRI ""alumni"", business associates, faculty, friends and family to help support this important program. The summer stipend for this program is $2000 per student, where other costs for the program are covered by the PI's and AMRI.

This program has been very impactful over the years. While we have not been able to track all our participants, we know that several have gone on to obtain bachelor's degrees in the sciences and others have gone on to complete doctorates. Madalyn Radlaurer (Summer 2004) went on to complete a B.S. in Chemistry from Stanford University in 2008, a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Cal Tech in 2014, a postdoc at the University of Minnesota (2014-2017), and now she is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at San Jose State.

Summer Academic Research Experience,JHU,"The Summer Academic Research Experience (SARE) is a high school component of our Johns Hopkins Initiative for Careers in Science and Medicine.  SARE seeks to develop exceptional high school students from low-income (<200% of the federal poverty level) and educationally under-resourced (most commonly first-generation college or attends, or would have attended based on their home address, a high school where the majority are also low-income) backgrounds, by introducing them to biomedical research. The students who go through the program are known as “SARE Scholars”.  To date, 95% of our scholars who have reached college age have matriculated into college with nearly 100% receiving partial or full financial support.  SARE also has ≥64% college completion rate by four years post high school graduation, and a ≥77% college completion rate by six years post-high school graduation.  80% have graduated with degrees in STEM or medical-related majors (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medical-related sciences; STEMM).  These outcomes compare quite favorably to the 10-14% national college completion rate by six years post-college matriculation for students from socioeconomically under-resourced backgrounds. SARE provides its scholars with a unique exposure to modern scientific research, combined with additional tutoring to fortify academic skills. The rationale is that many low-income youth may not have had the opportunity to be exposed to environments where creative and critical thinking skills are emphasized, where substantial academic accomplishment is celebrated, and where colleagues of all levels are ready to help when one needs it. Laboratories within academic research universities cultivate this type of environment. Therefore, we leverage this environment and utilize our science in outreach to this younger group of students. While research universities already have many outreach programs, most target the undergraduate and post-baccalaureate levels. Through SARE, Johns Hopkins targets adolescents at a critical age in an intensive manner, allowing for substantial impact that will carry on through these students’ lives.",https://sare.cellbio.jhmi.edu/,8711f088-4e94-4871-bccb-0babd53a3c39,"[""In-Person""]","[""Maryland""]","[""Paid""]","[""Program"",""STEM"",""University""]","[""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,TRUE,false,[],[]

ACTUARIAL SCIENCE CAMP
Home About LVC Summer Camps & Community Programming Actuarial Science Camp
Our Actuarial Science Summer Camps are week-long intensive programs for rising high school seniors designed to help them decide if they’re interested in actuarial careers. LVC has had a successful Actuarial Science Program for more than 50 years, and we’ve run this summer camp for more than three decades. Leveraging industry connections and alumni suggestions, we’ve forged an authentic experience that features interaction with actuaries and an introduction to relevant software and content.

In the summer of 2026, we will have two one-week long camps:

June 21–26, 2026
July 5–10, 2026
To apply to the summer camp, fill out the application form using the Apply button below. A letter of recommendation is also required. The letter should be no more than one page and be from a high school teacher familiar with your work in mathematics. The letter of recommendation must be emailed to Dr. Patrick Brewer at brewer@lvc.edu.

IN THEIR WORDS 
Job Preparation
Practical Experience
The camp convinced me that I would find actuarial science interesting and that LVC had a strong program that would lead me to job opportunities. While there is a heavy math requirement in becoming an actuary, and it is easy to get wrapped up in the math course work, other skills like communication and programming are what will set you apart and get you a job. One of the most important skills to have is the ability to present complex information in a straightforward and engaging way.

CCRI - Climate Change,NASA,"Internships are educational hands-on opportunities that provide unique NASA-related research and operational experiences for educators and high school, undergraduate, and graduate students (age 16 and up). To learn more, visit https://intern.nasa.gov. Climate change has impacted all components of the environment, and the impacts on global lakes have been quite noticeable. There are over 100 million lakes on Earth (excluding those that are covered with glaciers), covering roughly 4% of the total land surface. Natural lakes and man-made reservoirs are essential sources of freshwater, and they provide inarguably important services to society. They are used for fresh drinking water, municipalities, recreational activities, and fisheries. Moreover, lakes play a major role in carbon sequestration and thereby are critically important for our planet. Many lakes have been desiccated by the adverse impacts of climate change, and their ensuing degraded water quality has led to major losses in economic and ecological value as they have now become significant societal and health risks. In addition to climate change desiccation, lakes are dying and degrading due to human mismanagement, point and non-point source pollution, and general loss. The extent and rate of global “lake-loss” is not fully understood. Therefore, many aspects of in-land water bodies require robust, comprehensive study and monitoring in order to achieve sustainable environments, habitats, economies, and agriculture. Spaceborne remote sensing observations with their unique spatial and temporal coverage have considerable capabilities for supporting investigations of the Earth system including in-land water bodies. This project, therefore, focuses on the application of satellite remote sensing and geographic information system techniques complimented by ground observations to study lakes and to provide insights about “lake-health” and about “lake-response” to the adverse impacts of climate change. Interns will obtain and analyze satellite data from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R), LandSat, ECOSTRESS, Sentinel 2A, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), etc.",https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001Qx9aEAC/ccri-monitoring-and-studying-lakes-from-space-in-a-changing-climate,ca6d8fdc-0fb1-4191-9165-014ec89378de,"[""In-Person"",""Remote""]","[""New York""]","[""Free""]","[""Program"",""STEM"",""Private""]","[""Domestic Students""]",true,false,,,FALSE,false,[],[]

Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (Riley Lab)

Our competitive Research Intensives program places high-achieving high school students in professional working labs alongside distinguished faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.

Research Intensive in the Antimicrobial Drug Discovery Lab (Riley Lab)

We live in the post-antibiotic era, which refers to the fact that bacterial pathogens harbor resistance to our most powerful antibiotics. In fact, by 2050, antibiotic resistant infections will be the leading cause of death in the world. The Riley Lab is hard at work discovering and developing a novel family of antimicrobials, the bacteriocins. These protein toxins are produced by most species of bacteria and are designed to narrowly target other members of the same species. This mode of action stands in sharp contrast to conventional antibiotics, which kill any bacteria present, including members of our precious microbiomes. Our microbiomes are critical in determining our health and antibiotics have wreaked havoc on these precious health-promoting symbionts.

If you join our lab you will be part of an exciting journey as we hunt for novel bacteriocin-based antimicrobials that eliminate the offending pathogens but leave our healthy microbiome intact. Current projects include development of a bacteriocin-based ointment to eliminate acne, the creation of bacteriocin-infused sutures to prevent surgical site infections, and the development of bacteriocin-coated catheters to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infections.

The Riley lab can host up to 18 students. Learn more. 

Program Overview

During this program, high school students will assist UMass faculty and graduate students in research labs while learning about research methodologies and contributing to ongoing research studies. Each student will create and present a research poster to faculty, fellow students, friends and family at a poster session at the end of the program.

Students will come away with an introduction to the field of Biology, firsthand experience with university-level research, and an understanding of opportunities that exist for undergraduate students at a major R1 university such as UMass Amherst.

 

Applications

For all Research Intensives applications: In your statement of interest, please include 3 lab choices from our list of available labs along with a brief explanation of your interest in each one.

This course is offered at the UMass Amherst campus as a residential program. Local students may apply to attend as a commuter.

American Computer Science League	
AboutGet StartedRegistrationFinalsMore

American Computer Science League (ACSL) organizes computer programming and computer science contests for K-12 schools, organizations and local groups.  This year will be our 48th year of continuous operation! Last year, over 7,000 students from 21 countries on 6 continents  participated in the regular season competitions. Wow!!
ACSL offers multiple divisions, providing an appropriate challenge for students of varying ages and abilities.  An unlimited number of students may compete in each contest.
Each season is divided into four contests, testing students on fundamental concepts in computer science, ranging from Number Systems to Boolean Algebra to Digital Electronics.  In the upper divisions, each contest also includes a problem to solve by programming using Python, C++ or Java.
Contests are administered online.  Team advisors facilitate students’ access to the online platform; the platform corrects the submissions and reports the scores to ACSL.  Online resources assist advisors to prepare their students for each competition.  Each topic on the Study Materials page is linked to the page of the ACSL Wiki that describes the topic in detail. 
At the end of the year, the top students are invited to compete in an online Finals competition.
The All About the ACSL webinar is a great resource for prospective advisors, students, and parents.  It was prepared by Nathan Gorski, the advisor of the Bay Coding Club.
