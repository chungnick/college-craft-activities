TechCrafters Camp
=================

[](https://www.abington.psu.edu/summer-camps/techcrafters)

3D Design and Print Extravaganza at the Penn State Abington MakerSpace!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Students will engage in hands-on, creative activities utilizing a diverse range of tools, technologies, and machines. Through this process, they will develop valuable maker skills in areas such as art, design, and engineering by solving unique, real-world challenges. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, students will gain proficiency with a variety of maker tools, including 3D printers and vinyl cutters, applying these technologies to design and create their own projects. Additionally, they will be introduced to advanced equipment such as the laser cutters, enhancing their technical experience, and broadening their understanding of modern fabrication techniques.

Tech Crafters Advanced Information
----------------------------------

After learning the basics about using the fabrication equipment, students will learn about other aspects of the fabrication process. They will learn to use design tools such as Tinkercad for 3D designs and InkScape to create graphics images. Students will focus on building a prototype project from the initial design phase. This will include their personalized 3D models, vinyl cuts, laser etchings, and textile embroidery. Students will be able to use material provided by the maker space and also personalize their own items (t-shirts, pillow covers, water bottles, etc.) with their designs.
