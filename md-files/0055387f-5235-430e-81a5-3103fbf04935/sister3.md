The full\-time, ten\-week program will start students early on a path of scientific discovery fostering creativity and inspiring students to think of possibilities that can lead to innovative treatments. To learn more about students and alumni who have participated in the YSF Summer Research Program and how it has helped them transform a passion for science into a future career path, contact us at [admin@theyoungscientistfoundation.org](mailto:admin@theyoungscientistfoundation.org).

 The Young Scientist Foundation is a not\-for\-profit 501(c)(3\) organization that provides high\-school students and undergraduates with a rare opportunity to discover their passion for science by working alongside accomplished researchers to develop new treatments for cancer and other diseases. This hands\-on experience is the young scientist's first step toward a successful career in translational research, in which scientific discoveries are turned into therapies that benefit large patient populations. A great scientific hypothesis is only meaningful when the concept is brought from the bench to the patient's bedside. We provide the funding and tools necessary for young scientists to learn how to make their discoveries a reality.
