**Introduction**

 The Young Scientist Foundation (YSF) invites applicants for the summer research program from highly qualified high school and undergraduate students interested in pursuing biomedical research.

The program is intended to go beyond the standard classroom. Students will be fully immersed in a research setting and will gain first-hand knowledge of working with premier scientists on biomedical discoveries in a laboratory environment.

**Awards**

 The Young Scientist Foundation will make a number of awards as determined by its available financial resources. Research must be conducted in a university- or medical institution-based laboratory matched by YSF under the supervision of a highly qualified mentor for a period of a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of 10 weeks.

Awards of $2,500 will be made directly to the student conducting the research and $1,000 will be made directly to the lab sponsoring the research. These awards cannot be used to directly cover tuition or housing payments. The awardee is responsible for withholding any taxes required by law.

Priority will be given to students that have previously participated in the program and rising high school juniors and seniors who reside in Ohio, New York, New Jersey or Connecticut.

**Eligibility**

 Applicants for the summer research program awards must be currently enrolled full-time in high school or an undergraduate institution with a current GPA of 3.2/4.0 or 3.4/5.0.

### Diversity Statement

The goal of the our admissions process is to further the mission of The Young Scientist Foundation, which includes connecting motivated high school students with passionate mentors, in order to provide a unique opportunity to embark on careers in science by engaging in meaningful medical research. To best meet the needs of the diverse populations in Ohio and New York, and to achieve the goals of the foundation, YSF’s admissions process uses a balanced and holistic approach that considers an applicant’s academic metrics, research experience and letters of recommendation in order to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse group and future research community. The selection committee also recognizes that many applicants who are underrepresented in research come from geographically, socioeconomically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, and that people from these backgrounds are more likely to eventually serve disadvantaged, underserved and marginalized populations. As such, our admissions selection approach also encourages consideration of disadvantaged status, as broadly defined, in the decision-making process.
