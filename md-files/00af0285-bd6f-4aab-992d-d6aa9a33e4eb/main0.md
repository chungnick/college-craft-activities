## Biology Camps

Hosting AP Biology and biology virtual camps for middle and high school students throughout the year for middle and high school students is a commendable initiative by the Department of Biological Sciences. These programs offer invaluable opportunities for students to delve deep into the world of biology, providing rigorous academic content and hands\-on experiences in a dynamic virtual environment. By offering AP Biology camps, we empower students to excel in their studies, providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in advanced coursework and standardized exams.
