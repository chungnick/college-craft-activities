## Mission Statement

At the Department of Biological Sciences at UT Dallas, we firmly believe that outreach programs facilitated by universities play a pivotal role in fostering scientific literacy, curiosity, and engagement within communities. Through interactive research workshops, educational events, and public lectures, the department aims to ignite a passion for biology, inspiring future scientists and informed citizens alike.

## Summer Programs

**[Summer Biology Research Workshop (SBRW)](https://biology.utdallas.edu/outreach/summercamp2025/):** The SBRW allows students to engage in authentic scientific inquiry, exploring cutting\-edge research topics under the guidance of experienced faculty mentors. These experiences not only enhance students’ academic skills but also foster critical thinking, collaboration, and a passion for scientific discovery.

**[Foundations of Computational Biology](https://biology.utdallas.edu/summer-computational-biology-workshop/):** Computational Biology is one of the fastest\-growing areas of biological research. At the crossroads between Biology and Computer Science, students in this camp will learn the basics of each subject and how to begin their own bioinformatics projects! Topics will cover introductions to biological databases and resources, protein and DNA sequence evolution, and the coding of independent programs to participate in student\-led research.

**Virtual Biology Camps:** Hosting biology and AP\-biology virtual camps for middle and high school students offers invaluable opportunities for students to delve deep into the world of biology, providing rigorous academic content and hands\-on experiences in a dynamic virtual environment. AP Biology camps empower students to excel in their studies, providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in advanced coursework and standardized exams.
