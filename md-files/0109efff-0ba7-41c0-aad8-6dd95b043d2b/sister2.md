The cost of NYU Precollege can vary depending on the number of courses and credits a student registers for and whether or not they choose to live on campus in the summer. Upon registering for classes, a student is responsible for all costs associated with course enrollment and program participation.

### Program Deposit

Upon admission, students must accept their admission offer and submit a $250 non\-refundable deposit in order to participate in the program.  This deposit is applied to a student’s tuition charges.

### Tuition \& Charges

Tuition is charged per course credit/unit, and a student’s tuition charges will be based on the total number of credits in which they enroll. The number of credits a course is worth can vary, however, the typical NYU course is worth 3 or 4 credits. In addition, some courses may have added charges for lab or studio costs. The number of credits a course is worth can be found in the Precollege course list.

When calculating the cost of attending NYU Precollege, it important for students to keep in mind the program’s course registration requirements:

* All students must register in at least 1 course to participate in the program in the fall, spring, or summer.
* Summer students living on campus are required to register in at least 2 courses total, typically worth a total of 4\-8 credits.
* Summer international students coming to campus with a NYU student visa must register for a total of 6\-8 credits.

### International Student Charges

**Attending In Person in Summer**

International students attending the program in the summer under a F\-1 visa are required to register for a total of 6\-8 credits to meet visa requirements. Students are also required to have health insurance and are automatically enrolled in NYU Student Health Insurance. 

* I\-20 Processing Charge: $50
* NYU International Student Charge: $115

* SEVIS Charge: $350
* NYU Student Health Insurance: $1,244

**Attending Online**

Online courses completed by international students from their home and outside the U.S. may be subject to tax within your home country; we highly recommend that students consult their country’s tax laws for more information.

### Billing \& Payments

Charges are not placed on a student’s NYU account until they enroll in courses. When a bill is created, the student will receive notification at their NYU email address. Students should pay their account balance by the deadline listed on their bill. Information about [how to view your student account](/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/when-and-how-to-pay/accessing-your-your-students-bill.html) and [pay your account balance](/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/when-and-how-to-pay/methods-of-payment.html "Explore Ways to Pay") is available online.  

Questions about billing and payments? [Contact the NYU Bursar Office](/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/contact-us.html "Contact the Bursar Team").

### Program Withdrawals \& Refunds

If a student decides not to participate in the Precollege program, they must officially withdraw by notifying the program in writing at [precollege@nyu.edu](mailto:precollege@nyu.edu).  Students who do not withdraw remain responsible for any charges on their NYU account. The timing of a student’s withdrawal will determine their eligibility for any refund of payments.

Summer students who sign up for campus housing may be subject to a $500 NYU Housing cancellation fee if they withdraw after June 1\.
