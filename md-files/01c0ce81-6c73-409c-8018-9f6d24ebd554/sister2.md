Loading...New York School of Interior Design’s Summer Pre\-College program offers high school students the opportunity to truly experience and understand life as an interior designer. It’s the perfect way to learn how a passion can become a profession. In the NYSID Pre\-College program, students will learn the basic how\-to’s of interior design and will complete a small portfolio project. They will be immersed in all that New York City, the design capital of the world, has to offer online, through virtual tours and live Q\&A with design industry leaders.
