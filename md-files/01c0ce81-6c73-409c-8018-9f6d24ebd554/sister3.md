2\. **Application fee**  
You must submit a non\-refundable application fee of $60 for domestic students or $100 for international students. This fee can be paid with a credit card using the payment due link on your status page. Cash payments are not accepted. The College does not grant fee waivers.   
   
3\. **Essay**  
Applicants must submit a personal, typed statement, roughly one page in length, describing their reasons for applying to NYSID and their educational and professional goals.    
   
4\. **Letters of Recommendation**  
All applicants must submit two letters of recommendation. Letters typically come from, but are not limited to, teachers, employers, design professionals or counselors. They should be able to speak to your academic ability, personal character or desire to want to attend NYSID and pursue a career in interior design. Recommendation letters must be submitted directly by the recommender.  
   
5\. **Resume**   
A resume is required only for applicants to graduate\-level programs.  
   
6\. **SAT/ACT Scores**  
NYSID has moved to a test\-optional admissions policy. SAT or ACT scores are not required as part of the admissions application.   
  
Applicants who wish to submit results from either the SAT test (CEEB code 0333\) or the ACT test (ACT code 2829\) must have official score results sent directly from the testing service.    
   
7\. **Official Transcripts**  
The transcript that will be required as part of your application is based on the highest level of degree you have completed:   
   
Current High School Student or High School Graduate  
   
An official transcript that indicates graduation from an accredited high school, including a graduation date is required for admission. If you are currently enrolled in high school, submitting an "in progress" transcript at the time of application is required.    
    
Transcripts must be received directly from the school to count as official. Some schools have the ability to submit official transcripts electronically. The school can submit the transcripts to[admissions@nysid.edu](mailto:admissions@nysid.edu). If the school is submitting paper transcripts, they must be received in a sealed envelope. We will not accept photocopies sent by the applicant as official.  
   
Applicants who have obtained a general education diploma (GED) must submit official passing scores.   
   
Transfer Student (some college completed) or College Graduate  
   
Applicants who have previously attended other colleges or universities must submit official transcripts from all schools attended. Transcripts must be received directly from the school to count as official. Some schools have the ability to submit official transcripts electronically. The school can submit the transcripts to [admissions@nysid.edu](mailto:admissions@nysid.edu). If the school is submitting paper transcripts, they must be received by in a sealed envelope. We will not accept photocopies sent by the applicant as official.  
   
MFA2 and MPS programs require a bachelor's degree in interior design, architecture or a closely related field.  
   
MFA1 requires a bachelor's degree in an area outside of interior design or architecture.   
   
**Applicants who have obtained a college degree are not required to submit their high school transcript**.  
   
**Applicants who have completed some college, but have not earned a degree, are required to submit high school transcripts in addition to transcripts from****all****colleges attended**.   
   
International Transcripts  
   
Applicants who have completed their education — high school (secondary) or college (post\-secondary) — in a foreign country must submit an evaluation of their transcripts by [World Education Service](https://www.wes.org) (WES) or one of the evaluation services listed by the [National Association of Credential Evaluation Services](https://www.naces.org) (NACES). 

[SpanTran](https://www.spantran.com/) provides a discounted rate for NYSID applicants using [t](https://spanside.secure.force.com/SpantranApplication?Id=7108fda6-9b1b-48a8-9616-32249684f2a8)[his application link](https://app.evalcompany.com/7108fda6-9b1b-48a8-9616-32249684f2a8). [Educational Credential Evaluators](https://www.ece.org/) (ECE) also offers a discounted evaluation option for NYSID applicants by using [this application link](http://accounts.ece.org/TPO/NYSID-F). Please check their website for more information.

The evaluation is required instead of any transcripts from outside of the United States, regardless of the language of instruction. The evaluation service will translate the student's academic credentials into English and convert their marks into the United States grading scale. NYSID requires a course\-by\-course evaluation stating level of education completed, grade point average and verification of any degree conferred.    
   
It is the student's responsibility to provide all high school and/or college academic records to an evaluation service for a course\-by\-course credential evaluation. This is necessary to determine admissibility and to assess any possible transfer credits.   
   
8\. **Portfolio**  
Portfolio requirements differ depending on which program you are applying to:

* Basic Interior Design (BID) certificate program: no portfolio is required for admission.
* Associate in Applied Science (AAS) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA): a portfolio of 10 to 15 pieces is required. The portfolio should be fine\-art based using a variety of media and may consist of still life compositions, sculptures, landscapes, portraits, figure studies, and/or renderings of interior spaces. Good use of color, proportion and perspective should be evident. Photography not recommended.
* Master of Fine Arts Post\-Professional (MFA2\) and Master of Professional Studies (MPS) programs: a portfolio with a minimum of 15 images of design work demonstrating a professional level of design skill. At least one project should be comprehensive including plans, sections, elevations and 3D renderings. Include design projects completed during your undergraduate studies and/or work done in professional practice. Group projects should be identified as such and your contributions described. Illustrations of self\-conceived design projects done outside of college or professional practice are not acceptable.
* Master of Fine Arts Professional\-Level (MFA1\): applicants have the option of applying with or without a portfolio. If a portfolio is submitted, it should follow the guidelines as outlined above for AAS and BFA programs. Applicants who do not have a portfolio or whose portfolio does not meet admission guidelines will be required to complete a two\-week workshop during the summer session if admitted.

Do not send original artwork to NYSID.   
   
9\. **Proof of English Proficiency**  
All applicants whose primary language is not English are required to show proof of English proficiency unless English was the language of instruction for their entire high school or undergraduate college education. This proficiency can be shown in several ways: 

* An official score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or TOFEL iBT. The minimum score is 79 on the internet\-based test. The NYSID TOEFL code is 9185\. The score report must be sent directly from the testing service to NYSID admissions.
* An official score on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The minimum score is 6\.5\. The score report must be sent directly from the testing service to NYSID admissions.
* Cambridge English B2 First, C1 Advanced, or C2 Proficiency with a minimum score of 176
* A certified score on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants). The minimum score is 100\.
* Completing English composition course(s) at an accredited institution in a country where English is the primary language can be used to show proficiency. High school students can show one year of regular high school level English courses. College students can show one semester of regular college level English. The final grade in these courses must be a "C" or higher in the American grading scale. Remedial courses taken in English as a second language (ESL) programs cannot be considered.
* Completing level 112 at an ELS language center and submitting an official certificate of completion. For more information please visit their [website](https://www.els.edu).
* Pearson/PTE Academic scores of 53 or higher can be accepted, with scores being sent directly to NYSID for review.
* Students who have taken the IB English A (Higher Level) course and achieved a score of 4 or higher will meet our language proficiency requirement, provided the course was completed within the last three years.
* Students who have scored a 3 or higher on the AP English Language and Composition or AP English Literature and Composition exams, and have taken the course and exam within the last three years, will meet our language proficiency requirements.
* Trinity ISE with a minimum score of 96
