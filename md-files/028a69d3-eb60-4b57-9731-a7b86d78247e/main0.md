**Summer Research Component (June–July)**  

Students engage in daily laboratory research under the guidance of a scientist mentor. The program includes scientific lectures, career mentorship, collaborative biomedical engineering projects, and instruction in bench laboratory methods. The six\-week experience culminates in student research presentations at the SHARP! Symposium. Successful students may have the opportunity to continue their research during the school year and potentially return the following summer, depending on available lab opportunities.

**School\-Year Component and the annual Biomed Breakthrough Challenge (August–April)**  

During the academic year, SHARP! participants serve as team leads for multidisciplinary high school groups competing in the annual Biomed Breakthrough Challenge (April). Teams address clinically relevant biomedical problems by applying biomedical engineering principles and foundational medical knowledge to design, prototype, and iteratively refine innovative solutions. Preparation includes weekly faculty\-led coaching seminars, delivered in person or via Zoom, focused on biodesign methodology, translational/clinical thinking, and technical execution. At the Biomed Breakthrough Challenge, teams formally present their projects to faculty judges and a public audience; prior winning teams have demonstrated functional prototypes and received mentorship and resources to support early\-stage translational and commercialization pathways.

**Community Service Component (To be determined)**  

As SHARP! Ambassadors, participants give back by leading hands\-on science labs for elementary school students, teaching biomedical engineering concepts in real\-life applications to spark an early interest in STEM.

**Academic Credit Component (3 Credit Hours)**  

Successful completion of SHARP! includes an embedded, credit\-bearing academic component equivalent to three dual enrollment credit hours awarded through the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the UIC School of Engineering. In the 11 month program, students complete structured academic activities that align directly with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) criteria for engineering education, including the application of biomedical engineering principles, engineering design under real\-world constraints, data acquisition and analysis, teamwork, and professional scientific communication. Requirements include sustained mentored research and design effort, participation in faculty\-led instructional seminars, completion of written technical documentation, and formal oral or poster presentation of research and design outcomes. Academic credit is granted upon demonstration of achievement of defined learning objectives and assessment benchmarks, consistent with ABET\-aligned standards for experiential and project\-based undergraduate engineering coursework.

### Expectations and Requirements

### 2\. Expectations and Requirements

##### Expectations for the Successful Participant:

The SHARP! Program is built on a foundation of respect: respect for the pursuit of science, respect for professionals dedicated to scientific careers, and respect for those eager to learn about science. Professionalism is required at all times.

**Training Requirements**

Participants must complete the following mandatory training modules prior to the first day of the program:

1. Biomedical Safety Training
2. Biohazards Training
3. Biomedical Orientation Training

Failure to complete both the online and in\-person components of these training modules will result in forfeiture of participation. Upon acceptance into the program, detailed instructions for accessing these modules will be provided.

**Program Commitments**

1. **Research Presentation**:  

Participants are expected to deliver a student research presentation at the SHARP! Symposium on the program’s final day. The symposium provides an opportunity to share findings with the scientific community, family members, and peers, highlighting the culmination of the six\-week experience.
2. **Biomedical Skills Development**:  

Throughout the program, participants will learn biological and biomedical methods via hands\-on research experiences and through afternoon workshops. Students are expected to:
	* Maintain a detailed lab notebook documenting daily activities, experimental steps, and observations.
	* Develop an understanding of how experimental methods are applied in hypothesis testing.
	* Build practical bench skills that can be applied in future biomedical research.
3. **Clinical Immersion Experiences:**  

Participants are immersed in firsthand clinical and surgical applications of biomedical science and engineering through structured, hands\-on training experiences. This component introduces foundational medical and surgical skills, including a supervised suturing laboratory, robotic surgery simulation using Intuitive Surgical robotic platforms, and certification in the nationally recognized STOP THE BLEED program and related emergency medical response skills.
