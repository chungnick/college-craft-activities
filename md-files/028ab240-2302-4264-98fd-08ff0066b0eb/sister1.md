# Opportunities for High School Students

Are you a Bay Area public high school student interested in health and science? The UCSF School of Medicine offers an exciting, hands-on educational program that enables high school students to explore potential careers in healthcare and research. This is your chance to learn from students from UCSF’s five professional schools!

# HealthLink

Healthlink is a free, year-long program for first-generation college-bound high school students in the Bay Area. HealthLink seeks to advance diversity through mentoring the next generation of health professionals by connecting high school students (high school sophomores are given preference) with a UCSF graduate student mentor from one of the five health professional schools: Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Physical Therapy, and Medicine.

Monthly sessions include one-on-one conversations with your mentor, ice-breaker activities, and hands-on workshops that explore the wonders of the human body as they intersect with the health professions. Career-focused workshops will help you visualize your path from high school to college and on to graduate school. In addition to monthly Saturday sessions, mentors serve as a long-term resource to help you navigate high school to set yourself up for success in your academic and extracurricular activities.
