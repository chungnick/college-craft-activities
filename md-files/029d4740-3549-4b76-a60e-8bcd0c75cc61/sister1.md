### program Description

 PZMC (formerly run as Williams College Math Camp (WCMC) ) is a residential math camp for about 30\-35 mathematically gifted high school students who have completed or are currently enrolled in Algebra 2 or its equivalent. Students will be exposed to several different areas of mathematics through colloquia and other activities, but the primary focus of the camp will be Number Theory \& The Art of Mathematical Thinking. Students will learn to explore the theory of numbers by asking thoughtful questions, working out examples, looking for patterns, making conjectures, and finally, proving their results. Note that Algebra 2 is the minimum prerequisite, but many of our students have had significantly more math coursework.

A typical day at math camp includes the following: group problem solving sessions, interactive lectures with ample time for student\-driven mathematical discovery, a math talk by an award\-winning mathematician or a panel discussion on what it’s like to major in mathematics at college, and plenty of time for fun including hiking, museum trips, planetarium visit, and a math movie night!
