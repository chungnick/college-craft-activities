## College Prep Bootcamp

### Camp Overview

Do you have what it takes to succeed in college and beyond?  Work ethic, drive, dedication to one’s goals, time management, logical reasoning skills, communication skills, and other habits of mind – each of these qualities are essential for making the most out of all the opportunities that await you in higher education. While this camp may help you decide what sort of school is for you if you are getting ready to apply, getting into college is not the focus. Instead, we will dive into the strategies you will use at college (and in life outside of the ivory tower) to make the most of all the possibilities that await you. This camp is suitable for juniors and seniors in high school as well as those who have already started college but want to enrich and deepen their academic experience there.

Logic and mathematical thinking are not just for mathematicians and scientists. We will see how the same logical and proactive mindsets and approaches to problem solving are just as effective for writing papers and debating philosophical arguments as they are in proving a theorem or answering a scientific question. In fact, we will see how logic puzzles can instill life-long lessons and skills for success. By taking a proactive and effectual approach to your college experience, you can create the life that you want for yourself, while maintaining a healthy and holistic balance between academics and life beyond the college classroom.

## Testimonials

## Camp Experience

College Prep Bootcamp is a one-week residential camp designed to give you a glimpse into what college life entails, and teach you how to make your college experience as successful as possible! Held at Williams College, and taught by a Williams College math professor, this camp will prepare you to make your college life a success from day one. We’ve seen so many students struggle in their first year of college:  failing with time management, being away from home for the first time, not knowing how to approach professors or choose the right courses, not understanding where to seek help or what is expected, feeling like a little fish in a big pond. We will help you with all of these issues before they become problematic, by taking a proactive approach. Design your own college experience rather than just letting life happen to you.

College Prep Bootcamp is not a math camp, but we will teach logic and problem solving skills that are useful across all disciplines, including writing and all forms of communication. Building a logical and effective approach to dealing with college life and the world at large, we will give students a strong foundation to carry forward and build on. Start college with a “win or learn” attitude and the life skills you need to succeed.

In addition to daily lectures, workshops, and college bootcamp skill sessions, campers will have time to explore what life is really like on an active college campus. Participants will have access to the college’s library, gym, and more. Camp is 9:30 – 5 daily, with optional social activities in the evenings.
