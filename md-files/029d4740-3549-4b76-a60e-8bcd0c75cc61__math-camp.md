Number Theory Camp
------------------

### Camp Overview

Welcome to PZMC!

_PZ Math Camp: Number Theory & The Art of Mathematical Thinking._

Formerly run as the Williams College Math Camp (WCMC), PZMC is the same camp with a new name. Same structure, same instructors, same location, same content!

PZMC is a residential math camp for about 25 mathematically gifted high school students who have completed or are currently enrolled in Algebra 2 or its equivalent. Students will be exposed to several different areas of mathematics through colloquia and other activities, but the primary focus of the camp will be Number Theory & The Art of Mathematical Thinking. Students will learn to explore the theory of numbers by asking thoughtful questions, working out examples, looking for patterns, making conjectures, and finally, proving their results. Students will learn through interactive lectures, group problem solving sessions, and final projects/presentations.

Note that although the mathematical pre-requisite is only Algebra 2, we often have students with more mathematics experience, from precalculus to calculus to multivariable and even linear algebra. One of the great things about number theory is that we don’t need those other math classes beyond Algebra 2. So we can have students with varying degrees of math experience working together successfully.

_**This camp complies with regulations of the MDPH and be licensed by the LBOH.**_

Special thanks to our sponsor, the _**American Mathematical Society**_, for their generous contribution to this year’s camp. With the help of the _**AMS Young Scholars Grant**_, we are able to provide attendees with an unforgettable summer experience.

### Fees & Dates:

Location: **Williams College**

Camp Fee: **$3,000**

2025 Camp Dates: **June 30 – July 11**

2025 Application Due Date: **April 25th**

Camp Experience
---------------

PZ Math Camp (PZMC) is a ten-day residential math camp for mathematically gifted high school students hosted at Williams College. Campers will be exposed to several different areas of mathematics through colloquia and other activities, but the primary focus of the camp will be Number Theory & The Art of Mathematical Thinking. Campers will learn to explore the theory of numbers by asking thoughtful questions, working out examples, looking for patterns, making conjectures, and finally, proving their results. One of our goals is to inspire students by showing them a fascinating world of mathematics not seen in standard high school courses and surrounding them by like-minded mathematically curious peers.

A typical day at math camp includes the following: group problem solving sessions, interactive lectures with ample time for student-driven mathematical discovery, a math talk by an award-winning mathematician or a panel discussion on what it’s like to major in mathematics at college, and plenty of time for fun including hiking, museum trips, and a math movie night!

FAQ’S
-----

##### How much does it cost to attend PZMC?

2025: **$3,000** (For those whose combined family income is at least $80,000 per year). Includes lodging and all meals while camp is in session. F inancial aid is available to those domestic students whose combined family income is less than $80,000. Early Arrival or Late Departure: **$100** (each extra day)

##### Who is elegible to attend PZMC?

Current High School Students who are currently enrolled in or have completed Algebra 2 or its equivalent (many of our participants have considerably more math than this). Successful applicants will demonstrate strong interest and promise in the field of mathematics. Occasionally, we consider current 8th graders with very strong math backgrounds.

Note that although the mathematical pre-requisite is only Algebra 2, we often have students with more mathematics experience, from precalculus to calculus to multivariable and even linear algebra. One of the great things about number theory is that we don’t need those other math classes beyond Algebra 2. So we can have students with varying degrees of math experience working together successfully.

##### When is math camp?

June 30 – July 11, 2025. Camp will begin at 8:30am on June 30th, and end at 4pm on July 11th. It is possible to stay at Williams for the nights of June 29th and or July 11th if necessary for transportation, but there will be an additional fee.

##### What will it be like to attend PZMC?

Campers will attend class and problem-solving sessions during the days. Evenings will offer opportunities for various recreational activities. Participants will also attend colloquium talks by leading mathematicians and panel discussions on what it’s like to major in math or opportunities for careers that involve mathematics. Participants will have some free time over the weekend and there will be organized recreational activities such as hiking or a museum trip.
