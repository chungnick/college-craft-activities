# YSP in High School

## It is an honor to be chosen as a Young Scholar

Research shows that only about 32 percent of high school graduates are ready for postsecondary education.

High school students participating in the Young Scholars Program on their high school campus have the opportunity to establish the habits and skills needed to succeed in college after graduating high school.

## Eligibility

Any student, regardless of grade level, who attends one of the following Dallas Independent School District schools is eligible to be a Young Scholar:

* Moisés E. Molina High School
* Molina High School Collegiate Academy (B-TECH)
* Franklin D. Roosevelt High School
* Roosevelt High School Collegiate Academy (H-TECH)
* H. Grady Spruce High School
* H. Grady Spruce Early College High School
* W.T. White High School
* W.T. White High School Collegiate Academy (B-TECH)
* School of Business and Management at Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Center

## How to Apply

A student who attends any of the Dallas ISD eligible high schools and who wishes to be a Young Scholar must complete a brief online questionnaire before Oct. 1 each year. Students will be selected for YSP based on the quality of their responses and space available on their high school campus. They will be notified of admission via email. Once students are chosen as Young Scholars, they are given the opportunity to remain in the program throughout their high school careers as long as they remain enrolled at one of the eligible high schools. Students must complete the questionnaire each fall in order to retain their place in the program.

## What to Expect

It is an honor to be chosen as a Young Scholar. Young Scholars have opportunities to participate in the following activities:

* Get valuable information and hear from experts in the field about what it takes to be ready for college
* Hear tips and advice from community leaders and others who want young scholars to succeed
* Earn incentives by attending free ACT and SAT prep sessions held at each YSP high school partner campus
* Talk with UT Dallas students who were young scholars in high school
* Attend events on the UT Dallas campus in Richardson, including YSP campus visits.
* Young Scholars will be expected to participate in surveys at the beginning and end of each school year in order to gather valuable feedback and continuously improve the program.
