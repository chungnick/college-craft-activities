* Coaches may be one of the following: a teacher, coach, counselor, leader in a youth organization, or parent/guardian.
* A coach must know at least one student on the team.
* A coach cannot be a judge in the same competition year.

All projects must meet the following rules:

* Any project that has won at ExploraVision’s regional and/or national level may not be resubmitted in future years.
* Any project previously awarded a prize in another competition may not be submitted.
* AI and the tool ChatGPT may be used to brainstorm and/or research your project ideas. These should be used as a tool, but not as the only resource for your project. Any information generated by these resources must be included in the bibliography with the proper citations from the original resources.
