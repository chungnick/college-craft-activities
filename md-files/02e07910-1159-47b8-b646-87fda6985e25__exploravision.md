### About Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision

More than just a student science competition! For a quick summary, please watch a video about ExploraVision.

Since its inception in 1992, more than 450,000 students from across the United States and Canada have participated in Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision. It’s a fun and engaging program that can inspire a lifelong love of science, technology and innovation for students and teachers alike.

### What is ExploraVision?

_The [ExploraVision competition](https://www.exploravision.org/rules-requirements/) for K-12 students engages the next generation in real world problem solving with a strong emphasis on STEM. ExploraVision challenges students to envision and communicate new technology 10 or more years in the future through [collaborative brainstorming](https://www.exploravision.org/how-brainstorm/) and research of current science and technology._

ExploraVision is a science competition that goes beyond the typical student science competition and into what it takes to bring ideas to reality. A teacher will sponsor and lead his/her students as they work in groups of 2 – 4 to simulate real research and development. A teacher will guide his or her students as they pick a current technology, research it, envision what it might look like in 10 or more years, and describe the development steps, pros & cons, and obstacles. Past winners have envisioned technologies ranging from a hand-held food allergen detector to a new device to help people who have lost limbs regain movement in real time.

### Who can participate?

ExploraVision is designed for [K – 12 students](https://www.exploravision.org/meeting-new-science-standards/) of all interest, skill and ability levels. The competition is open to students enrolled in public, private or home school in the United States and Canada. See our full [eligibility requirements](https://www.exploravision.org/rules-requirements/) here.

### How do I get my students involved?

The most important step is educating them about the program. You can then either implement it as part of your curriculum or [become a coach](https://www.exploravision.org/2024/09/29/rising-to-the-challenge-reflections-from-a-first-year-exploravision-coach/) for the students who would like to participate. But if they don’t know about it they’ll never know if they want to register. See our[Teacher Resources](https://www.exploravision.org/for-teachers/)page for more information.

### Why does Toshiba sponsor ExploraVision?

Toshiba was founded with a strong commitment to technological innovation, and this commitment goes hand in hand with the company’s passion for [science education](https://www.exploravision.org/meeting-new-science-standards/). Through Toshiba’s shared mission partnership with NSTA (National Science Teaching Association), the Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision competition makes a vital contribution to the educational community. Participants are provided the opportunity to better understand the core disciplinary ideas in science, and engage in the scientific and engineering practices espoused in the [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.exploravision.org/ngss-classroom/), as they wrestle with solving real-world, authentic problems presented via the ExploraVision competition. ExploraVision is one of the world’s largest K-12 science competitions and is a cornerstone of Toshiba’s efforts to inspire youth in the fields of [science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)](https://www.exploravision.org/2014/10/20/stem-contests-challenge-students-to-make-a-difference/).
