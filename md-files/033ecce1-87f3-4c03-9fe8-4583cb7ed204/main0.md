## [Advanced Physics Summer Program](/events/summer-programs/advanced-physics-summer-program.html)

Participants in the 2023 advanced physics summer program.

**The Advanced Physics Summer Program runs 9 AM - 3:30 PM on July 20th-31st, 2026 **(2-week Session)****

The Advanced Physics Summer Program jumps into the exciting world of physics. This program, designed for high school students (rising 9th-12th graders), includes awesome physics experiences important to high school and college physics! Activities include fun physics demonstrations and experiments, soldering, coding, robotics, learning about cool research areas and tons of career options, and more. Students participate in hands-on activities, visit cutting-edge research labs, talk to professors and graduate students, meet current undergraduates, and practice new skills through relevant projects. From Einstein's thought experiments to current code-breaking applications, students are introduced to topics not typically offered in high school. If you’re interested in science, The Advanced Physics Summer Program is the program for you.

A typical week’s activities include:

* Learning Physics
* Presenting Demonstrations
* Faculty and Industry Speakers & Panels
* Small Group Discussions
* Skill-Building Projects
* Soldering & Electronics
* Coding & Robotics
* Lab Tours
* Preparing for Science Careers
* Hilarious Games
