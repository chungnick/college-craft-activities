## [2025\-2026 Scholarships](/academics/undergraduate/ugrad-scholarships.html)

We invite University of Maryland physics majors to apply to the scholarships listed below. The Physics Department is grateful to the generous donors for supporting the financial need and academic achievements of our physics majors. *To support any of these awards, please visit: [https://umdphysics.umd.edu/about\-us/make\-a\-donation.html](/about-us/make-a-donation.html)  Thank you!*

 ##### **Physics Department Scholarships**

 Applying for scholarships is an excellent opportunity to help fund your education and increase your involvement in the physics community. 

 * The **Angelo Bardasis Scholarship** *for physics undergraduates, in memory of Angelo Bardasis, based on need and academic merit. Available to current students and accepted incoming freshman physics majors*
* The **Joseph Helfand Memorial Scholarship in Physics** *for a junior physics major, based on need and academic merit*
* The **Professor William M. MacDonald Physics Scholarship** *for a senior physics major, based on need and academic merit*
* The **Jerry B. Marion Award** *for a graduating senior dedicated to teaching*
* The **Physics Scholarship \& Award Fund** *based on outstanding academic performance*
* The **John S. Toll Prize in Physics,***merit\-based prizes for undergraduate students in the Department of Physics*
* The **James B. Langworthy Undergraduate Scholarship in Physics,***annual merit scholarships for physics majors*
* The **Professor Elliott W. Montroll Fund** *provides merit\-based support for physics majors participating in experimental or theoretical physics research*

 ##### **Physics Bardasis Endowment Fellowship**

 The Physics Bardasis Endowment Fellowship program is intended for current sophomore, junior, and senior physics majors. The program is designed to foster community and support students who are passionate about physics.  In addition to providing financial support, the fellowship provides academic, mentoring, and community support. Fellows participate in a semester\-long seminar and related activities to facilitate their success in physics at the University of Maryland.  For questions, please contact program directors, Donna Hammer (This email address is being protected from spambots.
