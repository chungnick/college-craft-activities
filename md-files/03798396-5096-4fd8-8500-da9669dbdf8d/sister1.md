# Music Technology and Production Camp

### Music Technology & Production Camp

This one-week camp focuses on approaches to music production for children 13-18. Whether they are beginners or experienced creators, campers will have opportunities to learn and/or develop their craft through working on solo and collaborative projects in such areas as songwriting, audio production, sound design, and effects processing. Each camper will create at least six different audio projects throughout the week. The camp will culminate with a concert featuring original work created during the camp.

### 2025 Music Technology and Production Camps

##### Session 1 - July 7-11, 2025  Beginner Level

This camp is geared toward beginning to intermediate students. Students can choose to attend as day campers or stay overnight (overnight campers need to arrive no later than 5pm the day before the camp starts).
