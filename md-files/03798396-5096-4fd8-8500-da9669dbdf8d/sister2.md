# Campus Housing and Dining | Campus Safety

### Campus Housing

Students choosing the overnight option will have the opportunity to have a true campus-life experience while staying in an [OSU residence hall](https://uhds.oregonstate.edu/housing-options/residence-halls). Resident assistants are assigned to each residence hall to ensure the [safety and well being](https://publicsafety.oregonstate.edu/) of SVPDA Academy students and to facilitate evening activities during the camp. SVPDA Academy participants will be conveniently housed near the rehearsal and performance spaces, campus dining facilities, and recreational opportunities.

### Campus Safety

A safe and secure environment is made possible through each member of the Oregon State University community's involvement in crime prevention and sensible behavior.In order to have a safe and successful Oregon State University experience, each person must take responsibility to recognize one's own vulnerability to crime and reduce risks through preventive action and cooperation with Oregon State Police and the [Department of Public Safety](https://publicsafety.oregonstate.edu/).

### Camper Code of Conduct

Students are asked to read and sign a camper code of conduct.

### Campus Dining

[Meal plans](http://uhds.oregonstate.edu/menus) are available to all students.  If you are staying overnight, a meal plan is included in your residential package. If you are not staying as a resident and would like to purchase a meal plan for the week, select the option on your registration form. There is a variety of options for those with food restrictions, allergies, and preferences.  Please feel free to take a look at the menus and contact the dining center directly with any food related questions at 541-737-4771.
