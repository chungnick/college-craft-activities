### Payment | Cancellation | Refund Policy - SVPDA Academy Programs (formerly SAC Academy)

For questions and requests, please call 541-737-5007 or email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#661507054807050702030b1f26091403010908151207120348030213)

*“Program” refers to any class, private lesson, ensemble, or event, including precollege summer camps and workshops sponsored by the SVPDA Academy.*

*“Participant” refers to yourself or your minor child for whom you are completing a registration.*

##### Payment

Payment for all SVPDA Academy Programs is due immediately after online registration in order to hold your reservation.

There are two payment options:

1. Participant may pay online by credit card (billed by "OSU CLA Sales and Events").
2. Alternatively, participant may pay by mailing a check (make checks payable to Oregon State University), or bring exact cash to:

```
Skip to main content
            Oregon State University
            SVPDA Academy
            110 Fairbanks Hall,
            220 SW 26th St.
            Corvallis, OR  97331
```

Please write the camp, class, or event name and the PARTICIPANT’S NAME in the subject line so we can apply your payment to the correct account. We will allow two weeks for the check to arrive in our office. If the check has not been received in that time frame we reserve the right to cancel the participant’s registration and open up the spot for another.  Upon receipt of the check, a confirmation of payment will be sent electronically to the e-mail provided in participant’s registration.

##### Precollege Summer Program Scholarships

There are a limited number of need and merit based scholarships available for some camps. If a scholarship is available, you will see an option to apply within the registration site. You may apply for scholarship by filling out the form within the registration site. Under the “Registration and Fees” tab of each program, a date will be listed for application deadlines and announcement of scholarship.  If you are awarded a scholarship, we will apply it immediately to the registration.  A confirmation of the scholarship applied will be sent electronically to the e-mail provided in your registration. If the scholarship does not cover the full amount of tuition, you will be responsible for paying the remaining amount once the scholarship has been applied. If you are not able to pay the remaining balance in full and need to withdraw your application, please notify us immediately.

Qualifying individuals may contact our office to arrange a payment plan. **Tuition must be paid in full by the start of camp or participation may be denied.**

##### Refund
