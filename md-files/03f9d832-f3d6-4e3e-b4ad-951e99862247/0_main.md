### First Session

#### Instructor

[Anna Bottino](https://www.smith.edu/node/562131), Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Research and Exercise Science, Springfield College

#### Course Description

This course explores how thoughts, emotions, and lived experiences shape one’s participation in sport, exercise, and movement. Students will examine key psychological skills—such as goal setting, imagery, self-talk, and arousal regulation—and learn how these can enhance psychological and physical experiences of sport, exercise, and other movement contexts.

Through hands-on learning in the classroom, lab, and field-based environments, students will further explore these concepts by reading, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information from both scientific and practical perspectives.

This course will require students to participate in light physical activity. It will particularly appeal to those interested in fields or topics such as psychology, kinesiology, sociology, health promotion, sports medicine (including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training), and sport coaching.

#### Instructor

[Doreen Weinberger](https://www.smith.edu/node/18791), Ph.D., Professor of Physics, Smith College

#### Course Description

This course is a hands-on introduction to robot design and programming. Unlike many robotics courses where the task is to build a robot that performs a specific function (for example, pushing ping-pong balls or battling with another robot), in this course students use their own creativity to design robots that do whatever they want. There is lots of trial and error problem-solving in both computer programming and building the robots. Student teams will receive a kit containing a microprocessor controller, a set of motors and sensors, and various Lego building parts and tools. They will learn how to connect the components and program the controller to make a robot that can move precisely, autonomously, and intelligently in its environment. With appropriate programming the robot can make decisions for changing its behavior based on sensory input, and do things like avoid obstacles, follow paths, seek out light, respond to messages communicated by other robots, and much more. Students will initially tackle a variety of learning challenges: building simple robots to accomplish specific tasks, while learning more and more sophisticated programming techniques. They will learn the engineering design process, testing and redesigning to optimize their robot’s performance. The course culminates with each team envisioning, designing, and executing their own unique final robot project

[Rebecca Thomas](https://www.smith.edu/node/17431), Ph.D., Senior Laboratory Instructor in Chemistry, Smith College

#### Course Description

In this course, we will decode food and drug claims. This course empowers you to look beyond the slick packaging. You’ll apply chemical analysis to calculate precise amounts of ingredients, evaluate product labels for their claims, and develop a critical understanding of the theories that marketers use to sell food, drugs, and supplements. We will also explore organic chemistry by investigating real-world chemical processes, including the methods for synthesizing and purifying a drug and the chemistry involved in producing various foods, like ice cream and cheese.

This course is for students who have not yet taken chemistry in high school. The goal will be for students to explore how chemists think about problems while learning some fundamental techniques used in the chemistry laboratory. This course will be a great preparation for students who are anticipating (or dreading) taking chemistry in high school.

#### Instructor

[Jesse Bellemare](https://www.smith.edu/node/1676), Ph.D., Associate Professor of Biological Sciences, Smith College

#### Course Description

In this two-week course we will explore the diversity of plants and their amazing ecological interactions with other organisms, from animal pollinators and plant consumers, to below-ground partners like fungi and bacteria. The course will emphasize hands-on experience with observing, dissecting, and sketching representative plant species, from mosses and ferns to flowering orchids and cacti. We will visit the amazing Smith College Botanic Garden for inspiration and to collect material for dissections and exploration, including work with microscopes to observe fine-scale plant structures and adaptations. Field trips to plant communities around the Smith College campus, the college’s [MacLeish Field Station](https://www.smith.edu/node/333076), and other natural areas will augment our considerations of plant biodiversity at local and global scales, from local wetlands to distant tropical rainforests. They will provide context for our consideration of the threats that plant biodiversity faces in the 21st century, from habitat destruction, invasive species, and climate change. The course will also introduce approaches to the scientific study of plant ecological relationships with other organisms. We will gain experience with formulating hypotheses, designing ecological experiments and surveys, and collecting and analyzing data on plants and their many fascinating ecological interactions. This course will be of interest to students who want to study ecology, conservation, evolutionary biology, botany, and landscape studies.

#### Course Description

Human genetics has fascinated us for centuries—beginning with the basic question of why we look like our ancestors and continuing to recent advances in medical and courtroom analyses. In this course, students gain experience with a variety of classical and modern techniques used in human genetic analysis. Students spend most of their time in the research laboratory, where they are the subjects of the experiments themselves! First, participants’ blood samples are collected (with a simple finger poke) for a variety of analyses, such as determining their blood types & calculating the frequencies of blood-type alleles in their class. From their own DNA, students determine their genotypes associated with human sleep habits and taste receptors. Students also construct part of their DNA fingerprints using multiplex PCR and analyze portions of their mitochondrial genomes. Time between experiments is spent learning about genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, and working on genetic problem sets, which review the following topics: basic patterns of inheritance, probability, and pedigree analysis.

This course is open to rising juniors and seniors who have completed at least one year of high school biology.

#### Instructor

[James Tsalah](https://www.smith.edu/node/562160)

#### Course Description

The study of geographic space has traditionally been a complex and time-consuming process. Cartographers once spent hours meticulously charting regions by hand using pen and paper. Today, however, much of our understanding of the world is digital. Various fields—such as ecology, earth sciences, and public health—depend on the study of “where,” which is fulfilled by the modern tools of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS enables the digital mapping and analysis of spatial data allowing users to bring complex datasets into insightful maps that convey their message to a broader audience.

This hands-on laboratory course is designed to help students develop proficiency in GIS software, and build the skills necessary to create well-designed maps that present scientific data clearly and effectively. Students will explore key techniques in spatial analysis, graphic design, and web mapping to learn how to tell their stories through cartography. They’ll then apply these skills in a self-directed project that unites their personal career interests with spatial thinking.

There are no prerequisites for this course. It will allow students interested in spatial data analysis across scientific disciplines to add a valuable skill to their professional toolkit.

### Second Session

#### Instructor

[Moira Flanagan](https://www.smith.edu/node/560393), Ph.D., Laboratory Instructor in Biochemistry and Chemistry, Smith College

#### Course Description

At any given moment, half of our planet is covered in high-energy solar radiation (sunlight). It is actually remarkable that life has learned to thrive in these conditions. In this class, students will learn about the different ways that life has captured solar energy. The course will cover how proteins are able to harvest and use light energy in photosynthesis, explore how solar cells are working towards a similar goal, and learn about how energy is stored with battery chemistry. Students will use absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy to learn about light-matter interactions and the pigments involved in photosynthesis, they will construct their own miniature solar cells, and learn some of the practical limitations on collecting and storing solar power.

There are no prerequisites for this course. The course is designed as an introductory experience for students who have an interest in environmental science, chemistry, and biochemistry. The students will be introduced to ideas in an interdisciplinary setting so that they can build connections between the disciplines.

#### Instructor

[Kevin Huang](https://www.smith.edu/node/556484), Ph.D., Associate Professor of Engineering, Smith College

#### Course Description

This hands-on experience introduces participants to digital logic circuits, the circuits that are the backbone of most modern computing systems. A solid understanding of the function and design of these types of circuits are crucial to computer and electrical engineering. Students will investigate topics such as design thinking, binary representation of numbers, the fabrication process of modern digital hardware, and combinational logic networks. For the final deliverable, students will build their very own digital logic circuit and proceed to test it by interfacing with an Arduino microcontroller. This class is open to all students who have an interest in engineering with no prerequisites.

#### Instructor

[Margaret Brown](https://www.smith.edu/node/399262), Ph.D., Teaching Assistant Professor, Appalachian State University

#### Course Description

Globally, young women face an array of health-related challenges in their daily lives, and this course empowers young women to explore them. Lack of gender equity, including the right to an education and access to health care, places millions of young women at increased risk for poor health and preventable deaths. Through individual and group activities, this course provides opportunities to learn about many of these issues, including health disparities around the world, violence against women, and the overall lack of data representing women. Course activities include research, discussion, and presentations. Participants investigate essential young women’s health topics such as the menstrual cycle, healthy eating, media literacy, violence, contraception and sexually transmitted diseases, and emotional health. These topics are considered within the contexts of current research in biology and medicine, and today’s multicultural society. Global Young Women’s Health is an emotionally intense and rewarding course that builds individual and group knowledge and awareness.

Due to the material covered, this course is open to students entering tenth grade and older. Students in this course become members of a close-knit working group, sharing their own stories, and learning from others while conducting research and participating in course activities. Students interested in health-related careers and medicine may find this course useful.

[Mikaela Laine](https://www.smith.edu/node/558386), Ph.D., Lecturer in Neuroscience and Psychology, Smith College

#### Course Description

Through studies of the nervous system, neuroscientists explore how we sense, feel, think, and move. Students in this course will learn about how neurons (cells of the nervous system) communicate through a fascinating array of mechanisms and networks to generate complex human behaviors. Using sophisticated microscopes, we will examine the cells of the nervous system and the neuroanatomy of the brain. Through experiments in the laboratory, including dissection of tadpole, zebrafish, and sheep brains, we will explore how neurons function at multiple levels: molecular, cellular, and in living organisms such as ourselves. We will use live zebrafish larvae as a model organism to assess the toxic effects of substances such as ethanol on brain development. With some simple (and painless) techniques, we will even measure nerve conduction in our own bodies and brains.

#### Instructor

[Samantha Torquato](https://www.smith.edu/node/388002), Ph.D., Laboratory Instructor in Biological Sciences, Smith College

#### Course Description

Bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that infect bacteria. It is estimated that there are 10 31 phages on Earth, but fewer than 3,000 phage genomes have been sequenced to date. Scientists believe that characterizing the functions of these yet-to-be-discovered viral genes will lead to important advances in biotechnology and medicine. This laboratory course is designed to involve each student in an authentic research experience: the discovery of novel phages! Students will experience the scientific process firsthand by designing an experiment, analyzing and interpreting data, and communicating results. In the laboratory, we will first isolate, purify, and amplify new phages from environmental samples by using a specific bacterial host. Then, we will use electron microscopy to determine the sizes and shapes of these phages. Finally, we will perform additional molecular biology techniques (such as DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, and gel electrophoresis) to analyze their genomes. This course will be of interest to students who want to study cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, biotechnology, or medicine.

Program Details

Overview

Smith College is among the top-rated liberal arts colleges in the United States and one of the nation’s largest colleges dedicated to educating women. In 1999, Smith became the first women’s college in the nation to establish its own program in engineering science, the Picker Engineering Program .

SSEP courses emphasize asking questions and learning by doing, not only by listening and watching. Students choose two-week courses; in these, groups of up to 17 students work alongside Smith faculty members, assisted by undergraduate interns. Informal lectures in the lab and out in the field encourage students to ask questions, and they learn to conduct actual experiments.

Most of the work is carried out as a cooperative team effort, with ample opportunities for individual contributions. SSEP participants learn how scientists and engineers formulate questions, work on sophisticated scientific instruments and develop valuable critical thinking and analytical skills.

Smith Precollege Programs are open to students entering 9th–12th grade in the fall. Smith is a residential women’s college. Our Precollege Programs offer a Smith experience for high school students. Review our Codes of Conduct for students and parents/guardians to ensure that this program is the right fit for you. College credit is not offered.
