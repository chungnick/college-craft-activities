Smith Precollege Programs are open to students entering 9th-12th grade in the fall. Smith is a residential women’s college. Our Precollege Programs offer a Smith experience for high school students. Review our [Codes of Conduct for students and parents/guardians](https://www.smith.edu/academics/programs-courses/precollege-programs/about-life-smith#conduct) to ensure that this program is the right fit for you. College credit is not offered. Please note that Smith Precollege does not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other protected classification. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:summerprecollege@smith.edu) if you have any questions.

For Summer Precollege Programs, enrollment is limited to ensure a quality academic experience. The selective admissions process is based on a student’s academic performance, a written essay and a teacher recommendation. Students must have a strong record of academic achievement, a high level of motivation, and a willingness to explore.
