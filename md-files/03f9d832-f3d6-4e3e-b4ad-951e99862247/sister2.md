More

Smith College Precollege Programs welcomes international students each year from around the world. You’ll find that our small classes, similar to the undergraduate experience at Smith, offer exceptional learning in an environment where women are taken seriously and inspired to excel as leaders. Smith is located in the northeastern region of the United States, an area with some of the highest concentrations of international students anywhere in the country.

**Please note that the application deadline for international students is March 1, 2026.**

International students are welcome to apply to any precollege program offerings. Tuition assistance is available. Smith Precollege does not offer financial support for travel expenses. Please be aware of any travel restrictions that may be in place in your country and the United States before applying.

When applying for a program, please consider both your interest and familiarity with the subject as well as your level of English proficiency. In order to succeed in our challenging programs, you must be proficient enough in English to keep up with classroom lectures, participate in group discussions, read and write English at a fast pace, and communicate and connect with your peers. Your English proficiency is critical to having a positive experience.

English proficiency tests (Duolingo, TOEFL or IELTS) are required for international citizens. They are required for students being instructed in a language other than English. If a student has been instructed in English for two years or less, they are still required to submit English proficiency test results. Students who have been instructed in English for three years or more are not required to submit scores.

#### Required Passport

All international students admitted to the precollege program and traveling to the United States must ensure they have a valid passport (valid for at least six months from date of entry) for travel to and from the program for the duration of the program.

#### Visas

Participation in Smith Precollege Programs does not constitute the basis for securing a student visa (F1). Students in the program should be able to obtain a Visitor (B) visa, because the program comprises a short recreational course of study and is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Information on the U.S. policy on short periods of recreational study is available on the [U.S. Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html).
