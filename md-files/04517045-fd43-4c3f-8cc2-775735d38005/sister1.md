The visa waiver program is a U.S. government program that enables citizens and nationals from the [Visa Waiver Countries](http://www.esta.us/visa_waiver_countries.html) to enter the United States for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa. The advantage of entering the United States under the visa waiver program is that you can travel to the United States on short notice without obtaining a visa.

***\***An approved [ESTA](https://www.estausa.com/en/esta-us/application.html) (U.S. Travel Authorization) is **mandatory** for all Visa Waiver travelers entering the U.S.*
