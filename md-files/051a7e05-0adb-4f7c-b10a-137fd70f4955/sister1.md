The application fee and spending money are not included in the total charge. You may also purchase a six-week membership to BU’s Fitness and Recreation Center for an additional charge when you arrive on campus.

**Note:** Application fees and tuition deposits are nonrefundable. No refund or reduction in the total charge will be made if you arrive to the program late, leave the program early, or are dismissed from the program due to a violation of the program guidelines.

## Financial aid

Limited financial aid is available for the [RISE](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/rise-internship-practicum/) program. Please note that awards are based on financial need.

**Financial aid requests and supporting documents must be uploaded with your program application. To reveal the financial aid request form in the application, you must answer “Yes” to the “Would you like to apply for financial aid?” question. Once you enter “Yes”, the financial aid request form will appear in the left navigation panel.** **We do not accept financial aid requests via email.**

If you would like to be considered for financial aid, please enclose the following documents:

* Pages 1 and 2 of your parents’ or guardians’ 2024 or 2025 Federal Income Tax Form (filed in 2025 or 2026). **Social security numbers must be blocked out before uploading.**
* A letter from your parent or guardian describing your general financial situation and the particular circumstances that prevent you from paying the full tuition and fees.

Financial aid applications must be received by **February 4, 2026**.

**Note:** Applications with financial aid requests are not considered complete until all materials, including financial aid documents, have been submitted. Admission decisions are made without regard to financial aid consideration.

## Scholarship opportunities

The John Snyder and Phyllis Snyder BU IMPACTS Scholarship is based on demonstrated financial need that provides a scholarship for students admitted to Boston University’s Research in Science and Engineering program. For more information, contact [rise@bu.edu](mailto:rise@bu.edu).

## Payment deadline

The payment deadline is May 1, 2026, or the date indicated in your offer of admission. Full payment not received by the deadline may result in the cancellation of your enrollment.

## How to pay

Boston University accepts payment for RISE by credit card, check, or international wire transfer. You will need your BU ID number to submit payment.
