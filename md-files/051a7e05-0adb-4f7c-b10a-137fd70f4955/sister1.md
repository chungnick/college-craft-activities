## A Day in the Life of a RISE Internship Student

As a student in the RISE Internship track, you will be fully immersed in laboratory activities and research from approximately 9 am to 5 pm each day of the week. In addition, you will attend weekly workshops to supplement your lab education, discuss your research, and learn about aspects of a scientific career outside the laboratory.

For **residential students**, meals are provided by one of the dining halls, with a range of cuisines available that include vegetarian and vegan options. The dining staff can also accommodate food allergies and other dietary restrictions. To\-go meals are available upon request for students who cannot travel to and from their laboratory during dining hours.

For **commuter students**, BU does not provide a meal plan; however, you may choose to dine with friends in one of the dining halls, with a range of cuisines available that include vegetarian and vegan options or at [campus dining locations](https://www.bu.edu/dining/where-to-eat/) (hours vary by individual restaurant). The dining staff can also accommodate food allergies or other dietary restrictions.

Commuter students will have access to the BU’s residence hall during designated hours.

While at BU, you will share dorm life and social activities with students from the [High School Honors](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/high-school-honors/) (HSH ) and [Academic Immersion](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/) (AIM) programs. To help you get to know your fellow students, and become familiar with the BU campus, and Boston, we plan a variety of fun group events during the first week. After that, we offer a variety of optional activities on weekdays and weekends. Commuter students will be expected to take part in a select number of social events. Weeknights are free for reading scientific articles, joining impromptu activities, or spending time with friends until curfew. Take a look at our Program Activities list below to see the types of exciting activities we plan.

You will also have plenty of free time to enjoy the BU campus and [all that Boston has to offer](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/admitted-students/about-boston/). In addition, you can purchase a short\-term membership to BU’s [Fitness \& Recreation Center](https://www.bu.edu/fitrec/), study at one of BU’s [libraries](https://www.bu.edu/library/about/), relax on the “BU Beach” (a popular student hangout with views of the Charles River), or visit Boston’s diverse neighborhoods.

## A Day in the Life of a RISE Practicum Student

As a student in the RISE Practicum track, you will meet with the lecture instructor each morning and conduct laboratory activities each afternoon. In addition, you will attend weekly workshops to supplement your lab education, discuss your research, and learn about aspects of a scientific career outside the laboratory. You will also participate in weekly site visits to explore Boston’s biotech industry.

For **residential students**, meals are provided by one of the dining halls, with a range of cuisines available that include vegetarian and vegan options. The dining staff can also accommodate food allergies and other dietary restrictions.

## Program Activities: Let the Fun Begin

There are so many great activities you can participate in as part of the RISE program: group outings to Faneuil Hall and Newbury Street, movie and game nights in the dorm, career workshops, basketball at FitRec, ultimate frisbee on the Boston Common, and more.

They’re all designed to help you get to know the city of Boston and your fellow students, and to build a strong sense of community. Also, they’re fun!

Take a look at the program activities offered in past summers for an idea of how you can spend your time here.
