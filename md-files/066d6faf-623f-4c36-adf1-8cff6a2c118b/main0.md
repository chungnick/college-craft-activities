Explore the intersection between art, design, and technology at NYU this summer!

User Experience (UX) design impacts how we interact with digital products and services. Good UX design results in interactions that are highly intuitive, fun to use, and useful. 

Through the summer program in User Experience Design, you will gain the foundational principles, skills and best practices for UX design and learn how to apply design thinking to come up with solutions to a variety of challenges. Students work collaboratively to frame problems, ideate solutions using different tools and materials, and develop products, services, or experiences that solve those problems for users. 

You’ll also learn technical skills using UX design software, like Adobe CC and Figma, and gain practice developing prototypes and interfaces that demonstrate how your design solutions will work.

## How to Apply

Eligible applicants will be high school students currently enrolled in grades 8, 9, 10, or 11\. Competitive applicants will have a strong academic record and demonstrated interest in technology and design.

To apply, submit the online application, which includes the following components:

* Questions related to your personal and academic information
* High school transcript
* Four Short Essay Responses
* International students are required to submit proof of English language proficiency

## Areas of Study

 UX Principles
 

Students will gain a foundational understanding of a large variety of methods geared at creating design solutions for different types of people, situations and practices.

 Research
 

Students will learn how to conduct research with potential users, collect and synthesize information, and be able to analyze that information for findings and insights.

 Prototyping
 

Students will develop technical skills in basic low\-fidelity prototyping using both physical and digital materials and tools (paper and foam\-core prototyping, wireframing tools, UI tools etc.). They will develop high\-fidelity prototypes using Adobe CC and Figma to provide a proof\-of\-concept product, service or experience that solves problems identified through user research.

## Student Life

Students attend classes Monday\-Friday and have scheduled time each day to work independently and collaboratively on assignments and projects designed teach them how to identify and frame problems and work with stakeholders to design solutions using industry\-standard tools.

Outside of class, students can take advantage of on\-campus activities and events organized for NYU’s summer high school students, where they can connect with students from around the world that share their academic interests and intellectual curiosity. Students can also take advantage of organized field trips to NYC attractions, like Broadway, Yankee Stadium, and museums. 

User  is an in\-person program that takes place at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn, New York. Students can elect to live on\-campus in one of our residence halls along with other high school program students, or commute to classes and program activities.
