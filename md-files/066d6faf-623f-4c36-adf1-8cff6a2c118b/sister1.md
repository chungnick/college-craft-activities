# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### UX: NYU Tandon's Summer Program for User Experience Design is a 2\-week, 10\-class online summer program that introduces high\-school students to the fundamentals of using design research to develop innovative and creative design interventions in the form of digital products and services.

Designers employ a large variety of creative frameworks, tools, and methods in order to understand users, and then use their insights to develop websites, applications, and platforms to better the way people live. Over this course, students will learn design methods and create detailed and rich prototypes of software applications using Figma and Adobe Creative Suite as the principal design tools. Students will be exposed to principles and practices in UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design, as well as related fields like visual design and design research.

By the end of this course, students should be well prepared for a transition into taking undergraduate STEM majors in college – students who are particularly interested in creative, artistic or designerly applications of technology design and development and computer science would really benefit from taking this course. Students who are interested in pursuing careers in UX or UI design and human\-computer interaction (HCI) will find this course ideal as an introduction to these fields.
