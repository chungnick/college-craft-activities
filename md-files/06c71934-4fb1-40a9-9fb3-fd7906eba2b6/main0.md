### Camp ARCH Hosts High School Innovators to Plan, Design, Build

Read a review from the 2025 Camp Arch event that took place in July.

> Each July, the Langford Architecture Center comes alive.
> In one studio, high schoolers arrange triangles of chipboard into twisting architectural models, some shaped like dragons. Not far away, others in hard hats and safety vests review job site plans before heading out to real-world construction tours. Across campus, landscape designers imagine greener public spaces, while future planners pitch revitalization proposals at City Hall.
