## Cost to Attend

Your attendance cost is the combination of your tuition, housing, dining, supplies, transportation, student fees and personal expenses.

For a better understanding of your total cost of attendance, please visit the Texas A&M University [cost and tuition rates webpage](https://aggie.tamu.edu/billing-and-payments/cost-and-tuition-rates). This webpage will provide you with an opportunity to review estimated cost of attendance information for undergraduate, graduate and professional students, as well as other resources such as the tuition calculator and billing and fee explanations.

Keep in mind that these resources provide the projected cost of your attendance. Financial aid packages, scholarships, assistantships, fellowships and employment opportunities can defray these expenses.

## Student Employment

Financial aid, grants and scholarships are not the only way to pursue an affordable education. We offer employment opportunities that not only fund your education, but develop your academic and professional interests.

View the college’s current [job openings](https://jobsforaggies.tamu.edu/).

Work Study

The FAFSA and TAFSA determine which students are eligible for work study, a form of financial aid that allows students to earn money to help pay educational expenses through on-campus and some off-campus jobs. You can search for jobs that are work study eligible in [Jobs for Aggies.](https://jobsforaggies.tamu.edu/)

Visit the [work study FAQ.](https://jobsforaggies.tamu.edu/STUDENTS/Types-of-Employment/Work-Study-FAQ-s)

Part-time Jobs

Students don’t have to qualify for work study to pursue employment opportunities. Visit [Jobs for Aggies](https://jobsforaggies.tamu.edu/) to browse job openings on and off campus.

Assistantships

Graduate students may be awarded an assistantship, a paid position that requires students to partake in part-time teaching or research in addition to their studies. If you are interested in acquiring an assistantship, contact your graduate advisor. There are four types of graduate assistantships: 

* Teaching
* Research
* Lecturer
* Non-teaching activities

Fellowships

Fellowships are typically stipends given to graduate students to fund their living and educational expenses. Fellows can be nominated by faculty or externally funded.
