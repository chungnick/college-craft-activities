# Urban Journalism Workshop

## Come study journalism in the most exciting city in the world. Your city, New York City.

The mission of the Urban Journalism Workshop is to equip high school students in the tri-state area (New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey) with essential journalistic skills.

The **Urban Journalism Workshop** welcomes all high school students who appreciate our mission, regardless of their identity or background. All high school students are eligible for consideration so long as they reside and attend high school in the New York City metropolitan area.

July 13-19, 2025.

## How do I apply?

Students must be at least 16 years of age and live in the New York City metropolitan area to be eligible.

Apply [HERE.](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mx.technolutions.net_ss_c_u001.KDW4Io7FlnyLZPy645sEZxpE5PDgw8L4SHvG-2DFoijKsXpw4GQPXc5OPHkniEEE7cd99S4testa1VjRntTlnUwpe3LDjAP16Nh8iurYCifCt9BNG2PglLSKGiRoyCvNzR_4br_9NKEF97HTMKdlF3Y2LaL1Q_h0_h001.rgYEoQq41yXS4ne-2Dn46oMXy8MW8Ufni-5FtQ4hkYnv23Y&d=DwMFAg&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=RMxQXNZvHpV2cqs2oap34Q&m=Jb1kJnFkK1h_qQn28BQHxHFl2FaSXKnBmlk1hO1E_ciNtq2kcN0_VMX6ttRyIlrL&s=g6riG4VkDpJ5ACdQJP3xoQGZ4Og_fNx0_DEAUpaNjiI&e=)

The app deadline is March 8 by 11:59 PM.

For admitted students, the program is free.

## Become a Backpack Reporter

During the workshop students will receive hands-on instruction from NYU faculty and visiting professionals and get the opportunity to report and produce their own multimedia stories.

Below is a list of what to expect at the Urban Journalism Workshop:

* Experience life away from home, living in the East Village in one of the NYU dorms.
* Produce stories to be published on the program’s website: [***The Spectrum***](http://www.nyuspectrum.com/).
* Visit some of New York’s most prestigious newsrooms, and meet with top journalists.
* Gain valuable insight into the college admissions process from NYU admissions counselors.

Alumni of the program, now in its 40th year, work at major newspapers, magazines, online publications and in TV and radio.
