Overview

### Overview

This summer, learn to navigate the college experience with the University of Maryland’s (UMD) Terp Young Scholars. During three remarkable weeks, academically talented students pursue an academic interest, engage with passionate faculty, and get a jump on college by earning three university credits.

Terp Young Scholars offers two learning options: campus or online. Both options provide innovative and engaging learning experiences. Participants choose whether to commute from home or participate 100% online. Students who choose the campus option enjoy access to UMD’s outstanding facilities and amenities while living at home and commuting to campus each day. Students who select the 100% online learning option participate in interactive virtual experiences that offer meaningful insight into life at UMD.

Terp Young Scholars is designed specifically for high school students (rising grade 10 to graduating grade 12). The program delivers an academic experience that is at the forefront of theory, thought, and technology. Participants choose one three-credit course (offered in-person or online), attend class, study, work on projects, prepare for exams, and interact with their peers and regular UMD undergraduate students in a rigorous academic setting. Classes are held every day, Monday-Friday, with meeting times varying according to the specific course. Classes generally meet for three hours a day between 9:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. and may include an afternoon lab/discussion.

Terp Young Scholars is an academic program, and admission is competitive. Participants are admitted as non-degree-seeking students to the University of Maryland for the Summer Session. Students are registered for one three-credit university course for which a grade and credits will be earned. The course cannot be taken pass-fail or audit. The grade and credits earned are posted to the UMD transcript and are part of the student’s academic record.

**Note**: With the exception of BMGT262, **Terp Young Scholars does not offer a residential option**. Students enrolling in the Campus Option must be able to commute to and from the University of Maryland, College Park campus.

#### Before the Application Process

1. [Select a Course](/pre-college-programs/terp-young-scholars/courses). Courses are offered either in-person or 100% online.
   * Students who select a course offered through in-person instruction must participate via the [Campus Option](/pre-college-programs/terp-young-scholars/commuter-and-online-options).
   * Students who select a course offered through 100% online instruction must participate via the [Online Option](/pre-college-programs/terp-young-scholars/commuter-and-online-options).
2. Review [Grade, Credits, and Attendance Policy](/pre-college-programs/terp-young-scholars/how-program-works#tysgradecredattend).

#### Important Considerations

* Admission is competitive and contingent upon space availability. Early applicants are more likely to receive their first course selection and be guaranteed accommodations.
* All students must demonstrate maturity, self-discipline, motivation, and a desire to succeed.
* Attendance for the entire three-week program is mandatory.
* Participation in Terp Young Scholars does not guarantee admission into a degree-seeking program at UMD.

Grade, Credits, and Attendance Policy

#### Grade, Credits, and Transcript

Students in Terp Young Scholars are admitted as non-degree-seeking students to the University of Maryland for the Summer Session. Students are registered for one three-credit university course for which both grade and credits post to the official UMD transcript and are part of the student's academic record. The University uses [plus/minus grading](https://policies.umd.edu/academic-affairs/university-of-maryland-grading-symbols-and-notations-used-on-academic-transcripts). The course cannot be taken pass-fail or audit. If admitted to UMD as an undergraduate degree-seeking student, the grade will be included in the cumulative GPA calculation

#### Attendance Policy

Students in Terp Young Scholars must attend the program in its entirety. Students are not permitted to miss class time, including arriving late and/or leaving early. Anyone who has an obligation such as employment, club sport, travel, or a similar commitment should consider whether this will interfere with program requirements. Lack of course attendance can lead to program dismissal or lead to a poor grade posting on the student's academic record.

#### Course Effort

UMD follows the Maryland Higher Education Commission's (MHEC) policies on "contact hours," a shorthand term referring to the amount of time required in various forms of education to earn credit. Credit-bearing courses are divided into three types based on MHEC contact hour requirements: lectures, laboratories, and internships. This applies to courses delivered online or in person.

One credit equals:

* 15 hours of actual class time
* 30 hours of supervised laboratory or studio time
* 45 hours of instructional situations such as practica, internships, and cooperative

In addition to the time a student spends in class, for every one credit hour of class time, successful college students spend approximately two hours outside of class studying. Below is a helpful chart that recaps a student’s obligation towards a 3-credit course. Some courses have longer meeting times due to studio, lab, and other course requirements. The additional course meeting times do not require additional study time.

| 3-credit Course | Hours per day | Hours per 5-day week |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Class Meet Time | 3 | 15 |
| Study Time | 6 | 30 |
| Total Course Effort | 9 | 45 |

Unlike high school, where a student’s time is structured with parents, teachers, and other adults setting limits, much of your time in the program is unstructured. Whereas in high school, teachers take formal attendance, check notebooks, use chalkboard or whiteboards, impart knowledge and facts, and teach to the text, college professors rarely teach the text, often lecture nonstop without whiteboards, etc., require research and thinking beyond the facts, and seldom take attendance.

With only 24 hours in a day, balancing responsibilities becomes crucial. This total effort shown in the chart above does not include other daily activities.
