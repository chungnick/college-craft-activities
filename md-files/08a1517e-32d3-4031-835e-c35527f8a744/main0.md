### The Prove it! Math Academy residential summer program will not be offered in 2026. Big changes are in the works to provide our unique curriculum and high-quality resources to a wider audience of math enthusiasts. Check this site for updates and announcements.

## You can solve it… but can you *prove it* ?

Prove it! Math Academy is a mathematics program taught by experts — a unique, high-quality resource to help motivated, talented high school students reach their full potential.

## From Problems to Proofs

Prove it! Math Academy serves as a bridge between programs/contests that emphasize computational abilities and those that expect students to be well-versed in proof writing.

## Ascending to Higher Mathematics

Located in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, our biennial summer program leads participants through an exciting and challenging two-week course emphasizing mathematical rigor and proof-writing skills in a problem-solving context. Outings to historic downtown Fort Collins and scenic locations in the Rocky Mountains make it an unforgettable experience.
