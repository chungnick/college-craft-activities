### The Prove it! Math Academy residential summer program will not be offered in 2026. Big changes are in the works to provide our unique curriculum and high-quality resources to a wider audience of math enthusiasts. Check this site for updates and announcements.

# Dates and Travel

Our biennial summer program is held in even numbered years. In 2020 the program will be held from June 22, 2020 thru July 5, 2020 inclusive. Students must attend the full two weeks of the program.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Program Arrival Date | *June 22, 2020* |
| Departure Date | *July 5, 2020* |

The program provides free shuttle service between Denver International Airport (DEN) and Colorado State University on both arrival and departure day, but participants are responsible for their own airfare and flight arrangements to and from the airport. Participants who are driving to the program should plan on arriving at the [Piñon Hall lobby](https://housing.colostate.edu/halls/laurel-village/) of Colorado State University on arrival day afternoon between 3 PM and 5 PM.  Finally, students should plan on departing to travel home after breakfast, with flight departure times no earlier than 9 AM, on departure day.

# Application Deadlines

The deadlines for applying to the 2020 Prove it! Math Academy summer program are as follows.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Submit your application by | *March 15, 2020* |
| You will be notified of your admission status by | *April 1, 2020* |
| Admitted students must accept by | *April 15, 2020* |
| Rolling admission for any remaining open slots | *June 1, 2020* |

All applicants who apply before the admission deadline will be given equal consideration, and any late applications that are received after this date will be considered on a first-come, first-served basis.

Students who meet the application deadline will hear back about their admission decision — either accepted, waitlisted, or neither — no later than two weeks after the application deadline. Admitted students must accept or decline the offer within one week of acceptance. Waitlisted students who are subsequently admitted will be given an extended deadline to accept or decline based on the time of the offer.

Flights are not included in the price, but we will provide a free shuttle service from the Denver airport to the campus. The tuition covers dormitory expenses, classroom reservation fees, meals, field trips, and instruction.
