### The Prove it! Math Academy residential summer program will not be offered in 2026. Big changes are in the works to provide our unique curriculum and high-quality resources to a wider audience of math enthusiasts. Check this site for updates and announcements.

# Eligibility

## Who Can Apply

Any student who meets **all** of the eligibility requirements listed below may apply to Prove it! Math Academy.

**Grade:** You must have completed the eighth grade or equivalent to apply for the 2020 Prove it! Math Academy. In other words, if you are either graduating from high school in 2020, or will be entering grade 9, 10, 11, or 12 for the 2020-2021 academic year (or equivalent for home-schooled or international students) then you can apply. We will not admit seventh graders who will be entering eighth grade in the fall after the program.

**Enthusiasm:** Any student who applies to our program should be ready and excited to *Prove it!*

## Who *Should* Apply

The students who will get the most out of Prove it! Math Academy are talented, motivated students who like mathematics and would like to improve their skill at developing and writing proofs and solving challenging proof-based competition and research problems. More specifically, the program is particularly well-suited for students in the following situations.

* Students entering the ninth grade who did well in [MATHCOUNTS](http://www.mathcounts.org/) or [AMC](http://www.maa.org/math-competitions) in middle school and want to prepare for contests such as [USAMTS](http://www.usamts.org/), [ARML](http://www.arml.com), or [HMMT](http://hmmt.mit.edu/).
* Anyone who is preparing for the [USA(J)MO.](http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/amc-contests/invitational-competitions)
* Students who are entering the eleventh grade and hoping to apply to [RSI](http://www.cee.org/research-science-institute) or [MIT Primes](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php), or work on a research project the following summer to submit to [Regeneron STS](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-science-talent-search) or [ISEF](https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef).
* Students who are entering their senior year in high school or high school graduates who intend to major in mathematics and want to get a jump on the kind of higher-level topics and background they will need in college and beyond.
* Any high school student with a strong background in computational mathematics who would like to learn more about proof and rigor in a problem-solving context, and have some fun in the Rocky Mountains with an amazing group of peers and instructors at the same time!

If you have an interest in learning more about mathematical proof and improving your problem-solving or research skills, we encourage you to apply to Prove it! Math Academy.

## How to Apply

To apply to Prove it! Math Academy, first work on the [admissions test](/admissions-test/) problems and write up your solutions, and then fill out the [online application](/apply/). The form includes a place to upload your solutions to the admissions test.
