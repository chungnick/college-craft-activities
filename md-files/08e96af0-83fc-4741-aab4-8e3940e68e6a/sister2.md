* Campers should have an interest in the communications field

**How much does camp cost?**

When you submit your application, no payment is required at that time. Once your application is reviewed and you receive your acceptance letter, additional registration and full payment is required.

* Early Payment: $1,500  
  (Deadline: April 2026)
* Regular Payment: $1,700  
  (Deadline: May 2026)

**When will parents or legal guardians be notified of acceptance?**

Acceptance letters will be emailed to parents or legal guardians in mid-April. Please note there is no waitlist for camp selections. If a camper is not selected for their first choice of camp, they will be considered for their second choice, based on availability.

Once a camper is accepted, parents have two weeks to respond with their decision. If we do not hear from you within this time frame, your spot will be offered to another camper.

Yes. To be considered for a scholarship, applicants must submit an essay of 500 words or less.

### **REGISTRATION PROCESS**

**After acceptance, what Is the registration process?**

The registration process is done online via Penn State Conferences and Institutes. Penn State Conferences and Institutes will directly contact parents or legal guardians with an official registration link for payment. Penn State Conferences and Institutes will be your main point of contact for camp-related questions, including drop-off and pick-up times, registration forms, and items to bring to camp.

Please note that your registration will only be confirmed upon receipt of payment. Failure to submit all necessary documentation will result in your spot being given to another camper.

Refund policies for camp cancellations are as follows:

* If you cancel 61 days or more before the camp start date, you will receive a 100% refund.
* If you cancel between 31 and 60 days before the camp start date, you will receive a 30% refund.

If you have a specific roommate in mind who is also enrolled in the same camp, you can make a request to room with them, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Occasionally, due to the number of campers enrolled, some individuals may be assigned to a single room.

**What supervision will be provided in the dorms?**Campers will have constant supervision from camp counselors to ensure their safety and well-being.
