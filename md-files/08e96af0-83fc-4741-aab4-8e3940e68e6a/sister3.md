## Broadcast Journalism Camp

Penn State's state-of-the-art television studio provides a home for campers who choose this option. Students will work in the same newsroom and studio used by award-winning Penn State students as they learn about TV news and sports productions. It's an opportunity to explore essential broadcast journalism skills, newsgathering techniques, storytelling and more.

The sessions allow campers to produce their own news or sports video story from start to finish. Students will have an opportunity to record their video and interviews, as well as write and edit their story.

Campers will also gain insight into other areas of TV news/sports from experienced professionals who have worked in the industry for years. Along with faculty, students in the broadcast journalism major at Penn State will serve as counselors, providing an additional resource for those interested in the field. This camp is a good option for students considering a career in either on-air or off-air television news and sports (including reporting, anchoring, producing and videography).

Along with that will come discussion and practice in shot grammar and story construction as well as hands-on camera training.

Campers will:

* Discover what makes a podcast successful.
* Pitch and refine a podcast concept.
* Collaborate in teams to produce and edit an episode.
* Practice interviewing, sound gathering, and audio editing skills.
* Learn to capture and hold an audience’s attention.

By the end of the week, you’ll understand how to hook an audience, craft an engaging narrative, and produce professional-quality audio features. You’ll also get guidance from Penn State broadcast journalism faculty and students, who will share advice for those interested in the field.

## Social Media and Content Creator Camp

Do you always know what’s trending? Like making social media content instead of merely consuming it? Dream of being a YouTuber or TikToker? The world of content creators is swirling with creativity, excitement and mystery. These storytellers have drastically changed how people seek entertainment, follow news, find community and educate themselves as shoppers. Opportunities abound for the curious, driven and creative in these connected times.

This camp focuses on getting the most out of social media for personal and professional purposes as well as seeing beyond the glamour of an influencer life. Campers will learn:

* How social media can help launch their careers as creators and help brands engage with their audiences.

* How to produce compelling photos and videos.

* How to find the right platform and audience for their own content ideas.

They’ll learn from instructors and counselors who launched their own digital projects and can break down the basics. This camp introduces students to the practical, professional side of social media. Throughout the week, they’ll get hands-on experience, creating content at events on campus and in the community. By the end, campers will recognize the opportunities and meet the challenges posed by social media – they’ll be ready to flourish in this digital age.

#### About Social Media Camp

## Visual Storytelling Summer Camp

In this camp, students explore extraordinary local stories by forming connections with the quiet lives of real people. During the week on and around campus, we will work to create beautifully photographed, memorable visual stories that center around empathy, an ability to make human connections and, most importantly, allow students to develop personal vision and critical thinking skills.

Visual storytelling is a craft, and a calling, that will continue to be a marketable skill into the future in a broad variety of fields and industries. Students will leave camp with a story they produced, and human connections they are proud of.

Practical skills and story process are taught in a hands-on workshop setting. During the sessions, we work on specific elements of craft; including camera basics, lighting, approaches to documentary production, and building relationships as trusted storytellers.

Campers approach visual storytelling as community-building, public-service journalism by documenting local communities in and around State College. It is an opportunity to take advantage of big school resources to produce small town stories in sessions led by prize-winning industry professionals and experienced Penn State faculty.

By the end of the week, campers will:

* Produce a visual project in ways that build trust in media
* Use professional cameras and other tools to gather still images, video, audio and text, edit them and present compelling stories online
* Evaluate their own work and work of the peers and provide feedback
* Build connections with sources, mentors and peers and develop empathy during the storytelling process.
