## Our history

Starting in 1929, Summer Music Clinic is the second oldest music camp in the USA by one year to Interlochen Center for the Arts. Encompassing the Wisconsin Idea, the mission of SMC is to be a true “clinic” for teachers, students, community, pre-service educators, and all to come and learn and grow together during the summer in an immersive arts experience.

### Teachers and counselors

[Apply to be an SMC Residential Counselor Summer 2026](https://studentjobs.hr.wisc.edu/cw/en-us/job/509720/summer-music-clinic-residential-counselor)

Our highly qualified teachers are chosen for their excellence, diverse perspectives and backgrounds, creativity and care as music educators and are drawn from the Madison area as well as greater Wisconsin and the U.S. Instructors bring their own unique style of teaching and musical experiences to their classes, offering current, wide-ranging opportunities for students.

Experienced and caring counselors are part of what makes Summer Music Clinic so special. Several were campers themselves and know the value of having a friendly and reliable support system while away from home. These supervisors — usually college students or young educators — ensure campus life is fun and safe for all who attend, resulting in a welcoming and inclusive community.

> As a music educator and 30+ year veteran of Summer Music Clinic, I have firsthand experience and have seen the arts and SMC transform and empower lives and voices of our youth. Students, faculty, and staff find an energy, acceptance, and encouragement for their creative lives to connect their artistic ambitions with their future lives in every possible way. SMC is also where many music educators, myself included, find their path. We want to give back because someone gave to us.
