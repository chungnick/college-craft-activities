#### Who is Morton Fleischer?

Morton Fleischer is a successful financier, entrepreneur and real estate investor. From his beginnings as a janitor in the local dime store to now, he has formed more than twenty real estate companies, taking three of them public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

With the Fleischer Scholars Program, his goal is to assist economically disadvantaged students allowing them to graduate from college and to encourage them to invest their time and talent back into their hometown communities upon graduation. He calls this the “multiplier effect” and hopes that these future leaders will serve as role models and thus cause a ripple effect in these communities.
