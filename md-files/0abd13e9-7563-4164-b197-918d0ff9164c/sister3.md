What percentage of the class is admitted through Early Decision?
:   * The percentage of students admitted through Early Decision varies each year. Early Decision is binding, meaning if you receive an offer of admission, you will be expected to decline all other offers from other schools.

What classes should I be taking in high school to better prepare myself for The Cooper Union?
:   * Applicants should take a well-rounded high school program, preferably in advanced coursework (e.g. AP, IB, Honors level courses, etc.).
    * School of Engineering applicants should complete one year of calculus, chemistry, and physics by the time they graduate from high school. Advanced coursework in these subjects is recommended.
    * School of Architecture and School of Art applicants should take visual art classes (drawing, painting, design, sculpture, etc.).
    * School of Architecture applicants should take pre-calculus.
    * All applicants should take courses that provide a solid grounding in the liberal arts, the basis for the [humanities and social science](http://cooper.edu/humanities) studies at Cooper.
    * [Each school has specific graduation requirements](https://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu/high-school-graduation-requirements).

For which Advanced Placement (AP) examinations can I receive credit?
:   * [The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture](http://cooper.edu/architecture) will consider AP credits for Calculus and Physics pending department approval.
    * [The School of Art](https://cooper.edu/art) does not accept any AP credits.
    * [The Albert Nerken School of Engineering](http://cooper.edu/engineering) views AP, IB and college courses as significant evidence of your academic ambition, accomplishment and preparation. However, we do not accept such courses for credit or advanced standing. The School of Engineering offers a math placement exam for Calculus I. Requirements to sit for this exam, include a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. Verified scores must be emailed to [admissions@cooper.edu](mailto:admissions@cooper.edu) in advance of the test.
    * The Cooper Union will consider granting credit for study in the Armed Forces, verified by The United States Armed Forces Institute (U.S.A.F.I).

Are there opportunities and programs abroad available to Cooper students?

Can I double major at Cooper? What about double minoring?
:   * No, students cannot double major at Cooper Union.
    * Pursuing a double minor may be possible but it requires prior approval from your department chair and/or dean.

What minors are offered at Cooper?
:   * Humanities and Social Sciences minors are available to students in all three schools but vary per program. In addition, students in the School of Engineering can major in math, chemistry, computer science, and bioengineering.

As an incoming School of Engineering student, can I switch majors before my first semester?
:   * No. However, it is possible (but not guaranteed) to switch majors after the first year with approval from the department chair and a 3.0 or higher GPA.

Does The Cooper Union offer interviews to prospective applicants?
:   * We do not conduct interviews as part of our undergraduate or Master of Engineering admissions process.
    * The Master of Science in Architecture admissions process may include an interview.

How much does it cost to attend The Cooper Union?
:   * [Tuition](http://cooper.edu/students/student-accounts/tuition-fees) per academic year is $44,550 ($22,275 per semester).  
        
      All enrolled undergraduate students are awarded a half-tuition scholarship currently valued at $22,275 per school year.   
        
      Additional financial aid may be available for eligible students to help cover tuition, housing, food, books, supplies, etc. The amount of additional aid will be based on a student’s demonstrated financial need. Students must file a [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) to be considered. The Cooper Union FAFSA school code is 002710. In addition, The Cooper Union offers merit scholarships to a select number of students.

      Cooper students are responsible for living and miscellaneous expenses. Click [here](https://cooper.edu/admissions/sfs/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance) to access our budget guide, which provides a description and estimate of additional expenses.

How can I estimate my financial aid award before being admitted to The Cooper Union?
:   * It is not possible to determine an exact figure without your Free Application for Federal Aid ([FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)). However, the [net price calculator](https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/cooper) will give you an estimate of your net price and aid eligibility.

Can International students work in the US on a F-1 visa?
:   * F-1 students may not work off-campus during their first academic year but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions.  
        
      After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:  
        
      - Curricular Practical Training (CPT)  
      - Optional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-     completion)  
      - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics               (STEM) Optional Practical Training Extension (OPT)

I took college courses through a dual enrollment program in high school. Can I receive credit for those courses at The Cooper Union?
:   * While we recognize the rigor of dual enrollment programs and encourage students to challenge themselves academically, The Cooper Union does not grant credit for college courses completed while a student is still enrolled in high school. However, your dual enrollment experience will be considered as part of your academic preparation during our holistic review process.

What is The Cooper Union deferral policy?
:   * Undergraduate admitted students may request to defer their offer of admission for one year. Each deferral request will be reviewed by the Office of Admissions and considered on a case-by-case basis. [Learn more](https://cooper.edu/admissions/deferral_policy).
    * The Master of Science in Architecture and Master of Engineering programs do not allow deferrals.

## Applying to The Cooper Union

When are applications due?
:   * The deadlines for submitting [your application](https://connect.cooper.edu/portal/application-page) for undergraduate admission:  
        
      Early Decision

      Regular Decision  
           - All schools: **January 5**

What does "Early Decision" really mean?
:   * Early Decision is available to undergraduate applicants. Applicants whose first choice is The Cooper Union might consider applying Early Decision. Early Decision applications are reviewed and applicants are notified earlier than Regular Decision applicants.   
        
      If offered Early Decision admission, you must agree to enroll at The Cooper Union and withdraw your applications to all other colleges. If you are not accepted under the Early Decision process, you may be reconsidered during the Regular Decision process, although re-evaluation is not guaranteed.

Are standardized tests required to apply?
:   * Only School of Engineering applicants are required to submit their SAT or ACT scores.
    * Learn more about our standardized testing policy [here](https://cooper.edu/admissions/standardized-test-requirements).

Can my SAT or ACT tests be self-reported?
:   * Yes. You may self-report or upload unofficial test scores as part of your application. If you submit your scores and enroll, you will be required to send official score reports directly from the College Board or ACT.
    * The Cooper Union's SAT code is **2097**, and our ACT code is **2724**.

If I take the SAT or ACT more than once, which results will The Cooper Union consider?
:   * Superscores for the SAT and ACT are accepted—we consider the highest section scores across all test dates submitted.

Should I apply as a First-Year or Transfer applicant?
:   * You should apply as a first-year applicant if you are currently in your final year of high school, or if you have already graduated but have not enrolled in or attended any post-secondary college, university, or other institution.
    * You should apply as a transfer applicant if you have graduated from secondary/high school and have enrolled in or completed coursework at a post-secondary college, university, or other institution.

What are the application requirements for international students?
