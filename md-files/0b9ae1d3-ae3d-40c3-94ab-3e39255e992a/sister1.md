Program Format

*Orientation*

Our program begins with an orientation in which we will review the overall program schedule, discuss policies and safety, meet your medical student Teaching Assistants (TAs), and answer questions. Staff will be on-hand to address any issues.

*Program Breakdown*

Our program is distinctive in its combination of lectures, hands-on experiences, and networking that will give students a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of what it means to go to medical school and be a doctor. Program components include:

* **Medical Topics and Career Awareness Seminars:** Students will hear from real doctors, medical students, undergraduates, and those in other health professions about what it is like to be in their career or in their stage of career development. Faculty from Tufts Medical School and from health professions across fields will discuss their research. These will be large group lectures with a carefully planned opportunity for questions and answers. Students will be able to ask questions so they can begin to envision themselves among the health care professionals!
* **Site Visits and Clinical Skills:** Through visits to the Tufts medical campus, veterinary campus, and other Boston area medical research facilities students will see how these institutions work and participate in a Q&A with practicing physicians. Field trips to the Tufts Clinical Skills and Simulation Center will include opportunities for students to build their medical skills such as taking vital signs, suturing a wound, “scrubbing-in,” and more! At the Tufts Medical Campus, students will have an opportunity to tour the Tufts anatomy labs and see human organs up close.
* **Medical Case Studies:** Students will work in small groups led by a medical student teaching assistant to collectively determine the diagnosis and treatment plans for a patient. Multiple different patient cases, which were designed specifically for this program, will be presented. Through these case studies, students will learn about several topics including antimicrobial resistance, asymptomatic infections, zoonotic diseases, and vaccines. 
  + Independent coursework - students will review material posted to Canvas (a learning management system) on their own schedule.
  + Small group activities - students will meet with a medical student TA to work through the case study as a group.
* **Clinical Diagnostic Lab:** Students will perform a multi-day lab called The Tragic Case of Stan using materials we will provide. Over a period of two weeks, students will be introduced to a fictional character, Stan, who will undergo a surgical procedure and face a complication as a result of a bacterial infection. To diagnose the cause of Stan's infection, students will perform various tests similar to those used in clinical settings. Students will also tackle the challenge of selecting a treatment for Stan, examining the standard of care, as well as novel approaches to treating infections. Learn more here: [The Tragic Case of Stan](https://sites.tufts.edu/ctse/great-diseases/infectious-diseases/stan-lab/#1).
  + Students will step through the lab in small interactive sessions led by medical students.
  + To take part in the lab students will be required to take and pass an online health and safety training. This is the same training that Tufts students must take to work with bacteria in a physical lab setting.
* **Capstone Project:**Students will work in small groups with current medical students to create a Capstone project on a clinical skill that they have learned or a health topic of personal and societal significance.

Supervision

Tufts takes the safety of its students seriously. All programs are staffed with resources appropriate to care for the size and nature of the program. Tufts makes reasonable efforts to secure background checks and provide Title IX training to every staff person responsible for students in its Pre-College Programs.

Students are required to attend all elements of the program schedule, and any expected absences must be communicated to program staff in advance. Tufts takes the safety of its students very seriously. As such, our current policy for Pre-College students states that students cannot be in a lab or leave campus during their program without the supervision of a staff member or explicit parental permission received through official processes.

Some elements of our supervision plan vary depending on how the student is interacting with our campus. Below is a brief overview of where to find information about this. Please note that not all programs offer residential/commuter/virtual options, but the below applies when they do:

* **Residential Students:** Safety in the dorms is also paramount. Please see the Residential Students section below for more information about how our Residential Life program is staffed.
* **Commuter Students:** The commute to campus and time outside of the program will not be monitored by program staff, although the Tufts University Police Department and other safety protocols (in which students will be trained) are available to Tufts community members at all times. Detailed information about traveling to each of our campuses, including details on parking, [can be found here](/about/university-resources/parking-transportation). Please check the course list if you do not know the campus on which your course meets. Please note: Commuter students are not permitted to enter any residence halls on campus.
* **Virtual Students:** Students are required to attend all elements of the program schedule, and any expected absences must be communicated to program staff in advance. Tufts takes the safety of its students very seriously, even in the virtual environment. Students who enroll will receive more information about our virtual safety protocols.

Residential Students

**Check-in**

Check-in will begin at 9 am on the first Sunday of the program (or Monday, 7/1, for Tufts College Experience & Tufts Summer Research Experience). Students are welcome to arrive on campus and check in on Sunday between 9 am and 5 pm, and between the hours of 12 pm and 3 pm if arriving by car. During check-in, room assignments will be distributed and students will have the opportunity to meet their Residential Coordinator (RC) and roommates and unpack.

For students arriving from out of town on their program's arrival day between 9 am and 5 pm, there is a shuttle service from the airport and train/bus station for students arriving from out of state. All details about arrival and departure travel will be communicated after you have been admitted to the program.

Students arriving outside of the specified window should be in touch with us to discuss what accommodations can be arranged. While we make reasonable efforts to accommodate students who need to arrive early or depart late, we cannot guarantee the same services will be available to students arriving or departing outside of the specified windows.

**Residential Life**

Residential students will get the full Tufts University experience by living on-campus in one of Tufts' undergraduate dorms! Rooms are air-conditioned with 24/7 security and hospitality; accessible rooms may be available upon request.

Bedrooms will be doubles in a common hall. Halls are divided by gender and age, and students are grouped into smaller communities known as Resident Advisor groups. Roommates and RA groups are determined based on the pre-program housing questionnaire, taking into account age and geographic diversity. Full bedding and towels will be provided and replaced weekly. Wi-Fi is available throughout campus.

Resident Coordinators (RCs) will live in each hall and work to create a strong, supportive residential community. A Resident Coordinator's role is to support students in every aspect of their summer experience while serving as a mentor and active leader.

The residence hall is secured at all times, and students are required to use a current, valid Tufts ID card for entry into the building. Each individual dormitory room is secured with either a mechanical or digital lock.

A dedicated residential staff oversees student safety during the entirety of the program. Students are honor-bound to follow clear safety protocols, whether on campus or in the city, and are required to use the buddy system during free time. Tufts takes the safety of its students seriously. All programs are staffed with resources appropriate to care for the size and nature of the program. Tufts makes reasonable efforts to secure background checks and provide Title IX training to every staff person responsible for students in its Pre-College Programs.

See our policy section for additional information, and please do not hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.

**Residential Staff**

Residential staff will support students as they adjust to living in a dormitory and being responsible members of a summer program community. The residence staff will include a director, senior staff, and one resident advisor for every ten students. Prior to the program, residence staff will be trained to lead student groups, manage student conflict and resolution, and oversee all safety aspects of the program. They will begin the program well-prepared to meet the needs of all Tufts Pre-College Program students.

**Dining**

Residential program fees include three meals per day and brunch/dinner on Sundays. All meals on the Medford/Somerville campus will be at Dewick-MacPhie Dining Center, conveniently located a few minutes from student housing. Dewick-MacPhie provides a wide variety of menu choices, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and an organic salad bar. All meals on the Boston Fine Arts (SMFA), Boston Health Sciences, or Grafton campuses will be provided through boxed lunches or by Tufts staff. Tufts staff will also provide meals for program-related activities taking place off-campus. Tufts Dining is able to accommodate most dietary restrictions and preferences. Please advise us of dietary needs during the application process.

**Activities & Trips**

We want your summer to be fun too! It is summer after all! Residential Life staff will be planning trips and activities throughout the summer that will allow students to make friends, build relationships, and relax from the world-class academic work they will be doing in the classroom.

**Daily Activities**

Daily activities might include ice cream socials, midnight pancakes, trips to local coffee houses for poetry readings, lectures around campus, visits to Davis Square, etc. The cost of most of these activities will be included, however, incidentals like coffee at the coffee house or public transportation fares for an optional activity will not be covered by the program.

Many programs are also planning their own program-specific activities, often thematically relevant to the program content itself. Look out for these activities in the program description above and in the information provided after you enroll!

**Trips**

Examples of past weekend trips include excursions to Six Flags New England, Crane Beach in Ipswich, Downtown Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Duck Boat tours, Charles River Cruises, and more! Please note that weekend trips vary from year to year and these are only examples of the kinds of trips this program might include. The cost of any such excursions (including transportation, entrance fees, regularly scheduled meals, and supervision) is included in the cost of the program, although souvenirs, extra food, and other incidentals are not.

Commuter Students

### **Commuting to the Program**

We know that for some students, living on campus is not the best option. We welcome you to our program! For commuter students, the program will begin at 9:00am on the first Monday of the program with an orientation and end at 2:00pm on the last Friday of the program with a closing event. Saturdays and Sundays are not program days and commuter students are not expected on campus on these days.

**Medford/ Somerville:** For more information on commuting to the Medford Campus click [here](/pre-college/student-life/enrolled-students).

**SMFA:** During each day of the program, commuter students should arrive on the Fenway (SMFA) campus at 9:30am, and proceed directly to their program's location. Students must depart from campus at 4:30pm. Students remaining on campus past 4:45pm, arriving before 9:15am, or on non-program days will not be under the care of program staff (parents accept responsibility). Detailed information about traveling to the Fenway (SMFA) campus, including details on parking and public transportation, [can be found here](https://smfa.tufts.edu/directions). Alternatively, commuter students may opt to take the bus with residential SMFA Studio Art participants travelling between Tufts Medford/Somerville campus and the SMFA Fenway campus. Commuter students opting for this option must arrive at the Somerville/Medford campus by 8:45am and be picked up at the Somerville/Medford campus at 5:15pm. No alternative transportation will be provided for students who arrive to campus after the bus departs. Specific meeting location and updated times (as needed) to be provided closer to program start.

Commuter students and their parents are responsible for ensuring their student travels to and from campus safely and on time each day. Detailed information about traveling to the Medford / Somerville campus, including details on parking, [can be found here](/about/university-resources/parking-transportation).

**Please note:** commuter students are not permitted to enter any residence halls on campus. Breakfast / dinner are not provided for commuter students.
