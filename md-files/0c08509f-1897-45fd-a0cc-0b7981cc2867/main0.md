## ABOUT

The Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP) places high school students in Department of Navy (DoN) laboratories where they take part in real Naval research for eight weeks during the summer.

SEAP gives academically talented sophomores, juniors, and seniors interested in STEM the opportunity to learn about Naval research and technology while receiving first-class mentoring by top scientists and engineers.

SEAP is a competitive program with around 300 placements in more than 38 laboratories around the country in which many participants go on to careers within the DoN. Interns are selected based upon academic achievement, personal statements, recommendations, and career and research interests.

## How it works

SEAP places academically talented high school students with interest and ability in science and engineering as participants in Department of Navy laboratory research for eight weeks during the summer. Interns will be selected based upon academic achievement, personal statements, recommendations, and career and research interests.

COVID UPDATE

×

The Department of Navy and Marine Corps remains committed to providing enriching internship opportunities, but due to the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, at this time we cannot guarantee that the summer 2022 program will take place in-person at the DoN labs. We are currently planning next summer as an in-person program, but students should be aware that the program may be shifted to a virtual program at any time between now and summer 2022.

We are actively monitoring the developing situation surrounding the spread of COVID-19. There is also a chance that the lab that selected you may not be able to participate in a digital/virtual setting. We appreciate your flexibility and understanding during this time.
