Naval Site Requirements for Participation in SEAP and/or NREIP

×

Naval sites interested in participating in the SEAP and/or NREIP programs should send an email to Reggie Williams at [naval\_internships@navy.mil](mailto:naval_internships@navy.mil "Email Naval STEM Interns"), no later than July 1st of any year, to request consideration to join the programs for the same year. Inquiries after July 1st will be considered for the subsequent year due to the requirements for the application process.

The following information is required for consideration to participate in the SEAP/NREIP internship programs:

* A letter of support from your Command leadership (government or civilian) addressing commitment to SEAP/NREIP interns and mentors.
* Examples of abstracts, technical reports, journal articles, laboratory reports, summaries, etc. that demonstrate evidence of technical work. If reports are available via the internet, a website link will suffice.
* Examples of the type of work a SEAP participant (high school student) would perform during an 8-week apprenticeship.
* Examples of the type of work a NREIP participant (college student) would perform during a 10-week internship.
* STEM majors of interest to your Command.

Thank you for your interest!
