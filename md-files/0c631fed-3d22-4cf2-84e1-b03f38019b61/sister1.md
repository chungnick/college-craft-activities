## International Rules

The *International Rules for Pre-college Science Research: Guidelines for Science and Engineering Fairs* are published annually to support students doing independent research safely. The International Rules are the official rules of the Regeneron ISEF and students competing at Society-affiliated science fairs.

The purpose of these rules is to:

* protect the rights and welfare of the student researcher
* protect the rights and welfare of the human participant
* ensure adherence to federal regulations
* ensure use of safe laboratory practices
* protect the environment
* determine eligibility for competition in the Regeneron ISEF

**Updates for 2026:** The Society has issued [new guidelines for AI usage](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Generative-AI-Use-Table.pdf) in student research and has published an [Educator Guide](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Rules-Educator-Guide.pdf) providing additional context and explanation of the International Rules.

### International Rules and Guidelines

* [2026 Rules and Guidelines (PDF)](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Book.pdf)
* [2026 Rules and Guidelines (HTML)](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/international-rules/rules-and-guidelines/)
* [2026 Display & Safety Rules (HTML)](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/international-rules/display-safety-rules/)
* [2026 Forms only (PDF)](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Forms/All.pdf)
* [Final Rule Modifications for 2025-2026 (PDF)](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/FINAL-Rule-Modifications-for-2025-26.pdf)
* [2026 Abstract with 22 Regeneron ISEF categories (PDF)](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Forms/2026-22-Categories.pdf)

[### 2026 Forms for the International Rules](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/forms/)

The Rules and Guidelines booklet includes the forms necessary to document adherence to the rules.  These forms constitute written documentation of what will occur, or in some cases, has already occurred, in a research project.

[### Educator Guide to the International Rules](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Rules-Educator-Guide.pdf)

This new Educator Guide provides additional context and explanation of each section of the International Rules with additional resources and further explanation. All are encouraged to use it as the reference it is designed to be.

[### AI Use Table](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Generative-AI-Use-Table.pdf)

Artificial Intelligence applications are evolving quickly and the Society for Science and the Regeneron ISEF Scientific Review Committee have created this table to indicate our guidance on when it is acceptable to use generative AI in the development and execution of a research project and how to properly cite this usage.

[### Field Work Safety Plan](https://sspcdn.blob.core.windows.net/files/Documents/SEP/ISEF/2026/Rules/Field-Safety-Work-Plan.pdf)

This guide is meant to help students and teachers in developing a safe, environmentally responsible project and should be reviewed along with the research plan prior to experimentation. This guide is based on EPA requirements for scientists collecting air, water, and/or soil samples while working in the field.
