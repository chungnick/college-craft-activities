# Welcome to Engineering Possibilities in College (EPIC)

**The application will be OPEN from January 5 to March 31, 2026.**

AN EPIC ADVENTURE AWAITS!

Do you like building projects or figuring out how things work?  If so, then you might be an engineer.

EPIC- Engineering Possibilities in College - is a one-week summer camp at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo that introduces campers to the varied fields of engineering through hands-on labs taught by university professors and industry professionals.  EPIC campers see "Learn by Doing" in action when Cal Poly students show them the satellites, prosthetic hands, race cars, concrete canoes, and other products they've developed.  In addition, EPIC campers get to design, build, and test their own projects!

EPIC provides an opportunity for campers to experience life on a university campus and meet others who share their interests.

If you are currently in grades 6-11, you are eligible to apply for the EPIC 2026 summer camp.
