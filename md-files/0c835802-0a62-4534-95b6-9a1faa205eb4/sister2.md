# EPIC 2026

When applying, students may select more than one session/week (High School program only). However, students will only be admitted for one week.

**2026 Engineering Topics**

Students are placed in "tracks" consisting of 2-4 labs. We try our best to provide students with a schedule that best matches the fields of engineering they state they are interested in learning about on their EPIC application. See the corresponding session tab for a list of labs being offered.

Participating students will learn about the following fields of engineering throughout the week, regardless of the track they enroll in, through guest speakers, Cal Poly engineering student panel, the engineering major fair, and their engineering counselors.

## Who can apply

EPIC is open to all current 6th-11th graders. The program’s primary goals are to attract more female, first-generation, and low-income students to the field of engineering and inspire them to choose it as a career path. However, **ALL** students are welcome to apply regardless of background. Acceptance into EPIC is based on your essay and an indication (from your GPA, the classes you have taken, extracurricular activities, etc.) that you have applied yourself to your studies. The EPIC program does its best to determine which students will gain the most from the program.
