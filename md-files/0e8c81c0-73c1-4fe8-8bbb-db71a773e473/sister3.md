# Brain Camp FAQs

## By what date do you need the $100 non-refundable camp deposit?

All deposits should be received within two weeks of registering online. Once the deposit is received, we will secure your camper's spot. A receipt will be emailed to the parent email address you registered with. Camp fills on a first come, first served basis.

## When is my full payment due?

A $100 non-refundable deposit is due within two weeks of registering online. The remaining balance is due at check-in on the first day of camp. Your deposit is applied to the total cost of camp.

## My camper will need financial aid to attend Brain Camp. Is that available?

A limited amount of financial aid will be available to help campers experience this opportunity. If financial aid is necessary, please contact [Becca Rohn](mailto:becca.rohn@hsc.wvu.edu).

## When do we pay the full camp fee?

Camp fees need to be paid in full at check-in or before the first day of camp. Full payment can be mailed in earlier to:  
  
WVU Department of Neuroscience   
c/o Becca Rohn  
108 Biomedical Road   
P.O. Box 9303   
Morgantown, WV 26506-9303

## Who should I make my check out to?

Please make checks payable to **WVU Foundation**.

## Can my high school camper sign up for a day camp option?

No, we only offer an overnight camping option for high school students so that each camper receives the full camp experience.

## Can my camper drive their self to camp?

Campers will need to be dropped-off at and picked-up from camp. Parents/guardians or another approved adult must sign-in and -out their camper. Additionally, this is a residential summer camp and your student is expected to stay on campus for the duration of the camp.

## My camper has dietary restrictions or severe allergies, what should I do?

If your camper has dietary restrictions/allergies, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can work with dining services to have an adequate meal prepared for your camper. We will try to meet all dietary needs, within reason.

## What type of supervision will my camper have overnight?

Our campers will be staying at [Oakland Hall](https://housing.wvu.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/oakland-hall). Brain Camp will have multiple counselors monitoring campers overnight. Additionally, there will be a front desk attendant watching the front door of the residence hall at all times. Campers are not permitted to leave the dorm after 9 p.m or without a counselor.

## What items will my camper need to bring to the overnight camp?

Overnight campers will be provided with 2 sheets, 1 pillow, 1 blanket, 1 pillow case, 2 bath towels, and 1 washcloth. Otherwise, campers should bring their own toiletry items. Also, campers should bring comfortable clothes. A pair of long pants or jeans is necessary. Each camper should also bring a pair of closed-toe sneakers for activities in the lab and outdoor recreational activities. Campers may bring snacks to keep in their dorm rooms, as well. Dorm rooms do not have refrigerators! Please let us know if you have any questions about necessary items.

## Will my camper have a roommate in his/her dorm room?

Dorm rooms will be double occupancy with same gender roommates. Please let us know if this is an issue. Campers can request a specific roommate if they know another camper who will be attending. We do not assign single rooms for campers.

## Someone other than a parent/guardian will be picking my camper up. Is this okay?

Absolutely! When you fill out your application, we will have a spot for you to write down folks who have permission to pick up your camper. If you don't include them in your application, we'll double check out list at check in!

## What happens if my camper wants to leave camp early?

If a camper decides to leave camp early **for any reason (including being asked to leave for behavioral issues)**, there will not be a refund. A parent or guardian will be contacted to pick the student up. If a camper is dismissed due to behavioral reasons, there will be no refund.

## What happens if there is an emergency and I need to speak with a camp coordinator or counselor.

All parents will be given office and cell phone numbers for Becca Rohn, camp coordinator. Please feel free to call them in case of emergency. We will also provide you with the counselors' contact information closer to camp.
