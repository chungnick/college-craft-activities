## Hands-On Learning Experiences and Guidance From Mentors

We offer paid internships and introductory programs for high school students throughout our organization. Each program offers valuable learning opportunities that support academic and career goals.

## High School Programs

For high school students who are interested in science, hands-on experience alongside pioneering researchers in biological sciences, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, cancer prevention, epidemiology and biostatistics can be life-changing. Many of our past interns have gone on to pursue rewarding careers in biomedical research and medicine.

### Summer High School Internship

**For Students Between 11th and 12th Grade  
8 Week Summer Program**

The Summer High School Internship (SHIP) is an eight-week paid internship for high school students includes two weeks of hands-on training in laboratory techniques and safety skills followed by six weeks of supervised work in a Fred Hutch faculty member’s research lab. Interns also attend weekly workshops and seminars and make a presentation during the final week.

[More About SHIP](/en/education-training/high-school-students/summer-high-school-internship-program.html)

### Pathways Research Explorers Program

**For Students 10th or 11th Grade  
2 Week Summer Program**

The Pathways Research Explorers Program, funded by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, supports rising 10th and 11th grade students (especially those from backgrounds systemically excluded from careers in biomedical science) in a two-week introductory summer program at Fred Hutch. We run two sessions in August of approximately 16 students each. Students must have completed a high school biology course to participate.

[More About Pathways Research Explorers](/en/education-training/high-school-students/high-school-explorers-program.html)

### Girls Who Code

**For Girls 10th - 12th Grades  
2-3 Sessions a Year and Meets Weekly After School**

The Fred Hutch Girls Who Code club is an after-school club specifically designed for high school aged girls. It is organized and led by computational biology graduate students from Fred Hutch and UW. The club holds 2-3 sessions per year and meets on a weekly basis after school at the Fred Hutch campus.

[More About Girls Who Code](/en/education-training/high-school-students/girls-who-code.html)

### Coding for Cancer

**For Students 11th or 12th Grade  
4 Week Summer Program**

Computational skills are increasingly important in nearly all fields of biomedical research at the Hutch and beyond. Coding for Cancer connects students with computational biologists, teaches hands-on skills, and show how coding and computational tools are used in cancer research.

No prior coding experience is necessary.

## Other Internships and Positions

At Fred Hutch, we rely on a wide array of scientific and non-scientific staff in our quest to save lives and advance knowledge. In addition to the programs above, individual research labs and administrative departments (e.g. Research Administration, Environmental Health & Safety) may offer internships throughout the year, which you can search for on our [careers page](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/careers/job-openings.html?p=icims). Current undergraduates and recent graduates can search our [careers page](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/careers/job-openings.html?p=icims) for work study and paid positions in your area of interest and which fit your experience level.
