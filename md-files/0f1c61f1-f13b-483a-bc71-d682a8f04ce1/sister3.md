## Fueling Breakthroughs in Prevention, Detection and Treatment

Fred Hutch scientists are producing some of the most important breakthroughs in the prevention, early detection and treatment of cancer, HIV and other diseases. Our scientists study every aspect of the disease process — from the cellular level to the population level — to uncover the factors that influence disease risk and progression. Fred Hutch has been home to three [Nobel laureates](/en/about/about-the-hutch/honors-awards.html), and our faculty includes more than 200 renowned researchers who collaborate with colleagues across the globe and mentor the next generation of scientific innovators.

## Topic Areas

### [Behavioral Research](/en/research/research-areas/behavioral-research.html)

Our scientists work to understand how behavioral choices — from diet to smoking — can lead to the development of cancer and other diseases. They also develop and test interventions to reduce risk, particularly among underserved populations.

### [Biostatistics](/en/research/research-areas/biostatistics.html)

Our statistical experts and data scientists are involved in major studies from start to finish. Their work encompasses designing experimental protocols, developing innovative statistical methods, and collecting, analyzing and interpreting study data.

### [Cell & Gene Therapy](/en/research/research-areas/cell-gene-therapy.html)

Cell therapies — including blood stem-cell transplantation and some immunotherapies — have become a standard of care for many cancers and other diseases. Our researchers have led the way in this field since bone marrow transplantation was pioneered at Fred Hutch in the 1970s.

### [Cell Biology](/en/research/research-areas/cell-biology.html)

Our investigators have made major contributions to understanding the fundamental biology of life processes. These discoveries include important insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind cancer and other diseases.

### [Data Science](/en/research/research-areas/data-science.html)

At Fred Hutch, we invest heavily in data science infrastructure and expertise. Our aim is to make new discoveries faster using the vast and growing amounts of available genomic and health data.

### [Diagnostics & Biomarkers](/en/research/research-areas/diagnostics-biomarkers.html)

Our researchers have made major contributions to advances in diagnosis and screening for cancer and other diseases. Many of those discoveries have been spurred by the advent of DNA sequencing and other data-intensive techniques.

### [Disease Prevention](/en/research/research-areas/disease-prevention.html)

Our researchers study how factors such as diet, exercise and smoking are linked to cancer and other diseases. They are also developing and testing new ways to mitigate those risk factors and reduce people’s risk of disease.

### [Epidemiology](/en/research/research-areas/epidemiology.html)

Our epidemiologists are uncovering population-level patterns and risk factors for adverse health outcomes and diseases like cancer. Their goals are to refine prevention strategies and improve survival rates.

### [Gene Regulation & Expression](/en/research/research-areas/gene-regulation-expression.html)

Our investigators study the mechanisms that regulate how genes are turned on and off and how the misregulation of these mechanisms can lead to cancer. This crucial area of research lays the foundation for new targeted therapies.

### [Genetics & Genomics](/en/research/research-areas/genetics-and-genomics.html)

Our research into the genetic factors behind health and disease is leading to more precisely targeted treatments for an increasing number of cancers and other diseases.

### [Global Health](/en/research/research-areas/global-health.html)

Research on cancers that disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries is an important priority at Fred Hutch.

### [Health Economics](/en/research/research-areas/health-economics.html)

Our researchers are working to determine the most effective and cost-effective health interventions, how to improve adherence to standards of care, and how to bolster support for cancer patients.

### [Hematopoietic Transplantation](/en/research/research-areas/hematopoietic-transplantation.html)

Thousands of patients around the world are cured every year thanks to bone marrow or blood stem-cell transplantation, also known as hematopoietic transplantation. Hematopoietic transplantation was pioneered at Fred Hutch and continues to be a major area of investigation by our faculty.

### [Immunotherapy](/en/research/research-areas/immunotherapy.html)

Our researchers are discovering innovative ways to harness the immune system’s innate ability to fight cancer and other diseases. These include cell therapies such as T-cell therapy and antibody-based therapies such as radioimmunotherapy.

### [Infectious Diseases](/en/research/research-areas/infectious-diseases.html)

Our investigators conduct basic research on infectious diseases, study the epidemiology of those diseases and develop novel diagnostic methods. They also perform clinical trials of new ways to prevent and treat major infections.

### [Microbiome](/en/research/research-areas/microbiome.html)

Fred Hutch researchers investigate how microbial life in the human body may be tied to cancer and the efficacy of cancer treatments — as well as to obesity, heart disease, mental health and vaccine efficacy.

### [Survivorship](/en/research/research-areas/survivorship.html)

Our survivorship researchers are learning about the challenges that cancer survivors face, in order to better guide their lifelong care. Research topics range from the cardiovascular side effects of chemotherapy to emotional well-being and quality of life.

### [Vaccine Development](/en/research/research-areas/vaccine-development.html)

Our researchers apply fundamental knowledge about the immune system and virus biology to the design of more effective vaccines. Major areas of research include the development of vaccines to prevent HIV infection and studies of cancer-causing viruses.

### [Virology](/en/research/research-areas/virology.html)

Our scientists are advancing knowledge of viruses and the detection, prevention and treatment of viral infections. Studies range from the evolution of HIV and influenza to the role of viral infections in cancer.

### [Behavioral Research](/en/research/research-areas/behavioral-research.html)

Our scientists work to understand how behavioral choices — from diet to smoking — can lead to the development of cancer and other diseases. They also develop and test interventions to reduce risk, particularly among underserved populations.

### [Cell & Gene Therapy](/en/research/research-areas/cell-gene-therapy.html)

Cell therapies — including blood stem-cell transplantation and some immunotherapies — have become a standard of care for many cancers and other diseases. Our researchers have led the way in this field since bone marrow transplantation was pioneered at Fred Hutch in the 1970s.

### [Faculty & Labs](/en/faculty-lab-directory.html)

Fred Hutch faculty members conduct research that ranges from fundamental science to the development of new treatments and diagnostics.

### [Clinical Trials & Volunteer Studies](/en/research/clinical-trials.html)

Patient participation in clinical trials is a critical part of our disease research. Fred Hutch researchers and our clinicians are involved in hundreds of trials and volunteer studies each year.
