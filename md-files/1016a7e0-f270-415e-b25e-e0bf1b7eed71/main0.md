# Create Tech

Update

Due to limited capacity, Create Tech will not be running in 2025. Stay tuned!

Create Tech is a two-week non-residential summer program where rising 8th–12th graders create wearable and interactive technology using a combination of Python, Circuit Playground Express, raw materials and makerspace equipment. Students spend the weeks with current UMD undergraduate computing students and participate in lab visits and field trips.

*Note: Students with previous computing experience should explore one of our other camps, as this is created to be an introduction to computing.*
