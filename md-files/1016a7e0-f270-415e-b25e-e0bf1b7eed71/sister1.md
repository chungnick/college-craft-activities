# CompSciConnect

Application Deadlines

Applications will open Monday, January 26, 2026.

CompSciConnect is a three-year program that introduces middle school students to programming concepts. Over 120 students participate in CompSciConnect each year.

Over three years, students explore block-based programming like Scratch (Yellow), web design programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Red), and 3D game design programming (Terp). They also learn cybersecurity/safety, cryptology, number bases, logic and computer skills. CompSciConnect emphasizes how each of these skills connects to other areas of study and to making the world a better place.

We recruit completers from our summer middle and high school programs to become teaching assistants and stay engaged with the Computing Catalyst as they move on to college and beyond.
