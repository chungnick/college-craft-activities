# SECURE IT

Application Deadlines

Applications for the SECURE IT program are closed.

SECURE IT is a one-week, non-residential summer program where middle schoolers learn to think like cyber detectives while applying design thinking to protect the technology they interact with daily.

Students cover topics such as Linux, computer networking and adversarial thinking. Hosted by the [Secure Software Supply Chain Center](https://s3c2.org/)at the University of Maryland and North Carolina State University, the SECURE IT program invites students to return for fall workshops that meet monthly in the fall and spring semesters.
