# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### DII: What is innovation? What makes them fail or succeed? This program will teach rising 9th through 12th-grade high school students fundamental principles of innovation in science and engineering using contemporary examples, and how to design and build innovations of their own. Students will learn how to use rapid prototyping tools and computer-aided design (CAD) modeling, conduct fieldwork to identify problems, and gain hands-on experience at NYU Tandon's Makerspace designing and building solutions to these problems.

###### Innovation Mindset – Understanding what makes innovations succeed or fail, using real-world examples in science, engineering, transportation, medicine, and electronics.

###### Gain Experience in Solution Design and Implementation:

###### Engineering & Prototyping – Gain hands-on experience with CAD, rapid prototyping, and manufacturing at NYU Tandon’s state-of-the-art Makerspace.

###### Capstone Project & Presentation – Design, build, and present a working prototype, showcasing creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills.

### Design, Invent & Innovate Summer Program

# Meet Our Mentors

##### Design to Invent & Innovate (D2II) was designed by Prof. Khalil Ramadi whose lab — Advanced Neuroengineering and Translational Medicine — has bases in both Tandon School of Engineering and NYU Abu Dhabi. He is an assistant professor of bioengineering his latest work is focused on microdevices that are ingested orally
