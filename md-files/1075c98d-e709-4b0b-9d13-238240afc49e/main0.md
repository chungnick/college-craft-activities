# Robotics Camp

Robotics Camp partners.

[SDSU SMILE Lab](https://smile.sdsu.edu/) and [Talent Search](/oce/our-programs/talent-search) host a week-long summer Robotics Camp at San Diego State University for middle and high school students. The camp is funded by the National Science Foundation, the SDSU College of Engineering, the SDSU Talent Search program, and [Drone Legends](https://dronelegends.com/), allowing students to participate for free.

### Program Benefits

* Introduction to coding (Scratch & Python)
* Learn about AI, Cybersecurity and Renewable Energy
* Assemble and practice with MBot Mega robots
* Learn to fly and program drones
* STEM Labs & SDSU Campus Tours
* Guest Speakers
* There is no cost to participate (snacks and lunch are included!)
* Experiences like this look great on college applications and your resume!

### Application

The Robotics Camp is open to 8th - 12th grade students. To apply, students need to complete a student application and ask a STEM teacher to complete a short recommendation form on their behalf. The application period for the 2025 Robotics Camp has concluded.

Application period February-May

>
> “I liked being able to get exposed to what real programmers or engineers face and learning about the projects they’re studying. I liked touring the labs and seeing the projects [college] students were working on.”

> “This program helped me understand that coding and robotics is difficult but not imposible and that given enough practice, I can do something I would’ve never thought of being able to do.”

> “[What I liked most about the camp was] seeing different labs and places in SDSU that I might want to be in for the future. Also, it was fun making friends.”

> “I learned a lot on coding robots and making games. Also, I learned to persevere through the challenges.”

> “What I liked most was the programming in scratch part and the lab visits.”
