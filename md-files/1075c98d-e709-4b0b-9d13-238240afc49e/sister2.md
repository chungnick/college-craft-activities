# Talent Search

***Dear students and families,***   
*We want to let you know about some important changes to the Talent Search program. The U.S. Department of Education has decided not to continue the funding that supports Talent Search. This decision was not made by our team, your school, or SDSU. We are proud of our students' successes through Talent Search, which has operated successfully since 1993, and we are appealing their decision to end the program. While we are looking for alternative solutions, our online resources (including our [Student Resource Website](https://sdsutalentsearch.wixsite.com/student) and [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/sdsutalentsearch/)) will remain updated and under a different name.*  
  
*You might see a few of our former staff on your campuses because they have transitioned to a new job. This has been a difficult time for our Talent Search Team, but we are doing our best to close out the program while looking for alternatives to keep supporting you.*   
  
*IMPORTANT: If you have attended Talent Search meetings in the past four years, starting Monday, October 13, 2025, you can **pick up a certificate of participation from your school’s main office**. You can use it for your college applications. If you are in the 12th grade, you will also receive a printed Student Handbook.*

### About SDSU Talent Search

Our Advisors have extensive experience from diverse backgrounds (e.g., social work, psychology, counseling, and education) and we take a holistic approach in the work that we do. We understand that our students might be facing challenges and potential obstacles in addition to their academic careers. However, we strive to motivate and provide them with academic, social, and emotional support, and teach the importance of self-advocacy.

## Hear from our students!

> Talent Search Student
>
> 2019
>
> “This program was extremely helpful because in reality i had no idea what i was doing when i started filling out most of my college applications let alone when i started with my fafsa application. This program helped a lot with the understanding of the process and just being there for any questions i had.”

> [Destination: College Student](/ite-pages/events-and-services/destination-college-1)
>
> 2022
>
> “Thanks to my advisor [who] has been there since day one for me to help me get the FAFSA done, applying to SDSU and sometimes even personal questions that I had she would always clear my mind up and make sure I had everything done and on point. This program helped me to be more successful, motivated, and realizing that the whole grown up life is a fews steps ahead of me.”

> [Robotics Camper](/oce/our-programs/robotics-camp)
>
> 2024
>
> “The SDSU Robotics Camp was a wonderful experience, I enjoyed the chance to get to explore some campus areas and meeting new people”

> [STEAM Day Attendee](/ite-pages/events-and-services/steam-exploration-day)

> “[What interested me about the workshops was] the chance to hear people speak about their work and how college and social skills really benefit you when going through college.”
