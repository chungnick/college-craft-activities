# Summer College

UVA Wise offers more than 30 summer courses that can help you complete your general education requirements (whether you are a UVA Wise student or not) and fulfill elective needs with fascinating courses.

Summer Session I runs from May 27 to June 27, 2025. Summer II is from July 7 to August 8, 2025.

Taught by full-time faculty, classes are often small—approximately 12 to 15 students per course—and a great way to receive individual guidance from your professors.

## Tuition & Financial Aid

UVA Wise is proud to be consistently ranked by *U.S. News and World Report* as one of the top national public colleges whose students graduate with a low debt load. We’re glad to help you explore financial aid options to attend Summer College.  Contact the Office of Financial Aid by email at [finaid@uvawise.edu](mailto:finaid@uvawise.edu).

Session I registration will conclude May 28, 2025 and Session II registration will conclude on July 8, 2025.
