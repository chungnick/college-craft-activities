# Summer Leaders Academy FAQs

* **Who can apply to the pre-college programs?**

  *Students who will have completed their first year of high school by summer may apply. Non-credit classes are open to all students. Credit-bearing courses may be taken by rising seniors with a G.P.A. of 3.0 or better.*

  **Does the Summer Leaders Academy offer scholarships or financial aid?**

  *While there are no scholarships or financial aid, a limited number of need-based discounts are available.*

  *The deadline to apply for a discount is **April 1**.*

  *Students are encouraged to apply if they are eligible to receive free or reduced lunches at school and maintain a G.P.A. of 3.5 or better. Within the application, there is a section “More About You” that allows you to indicate if you would like to be considered for a discount. You may upload your proof of eligibility within the application itself or on the Status portal of your application. Acceptable proof of eligibility includes a copy of your family’s SNAP or free lunch notification (certification/re-certification) letter or a letter from a guidance counselor or administrator confirming your status.*

  **Can the application fee be waived?**

  *If the application fee is a burden, you may request that it be waived by emailing* [*[email protected]*](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87f4f2eaeae2f5ebe2e6e3e2f5f4c7e1e8f5e3efe6eaa9e2e3f2)*. Please allow up to a week for the office to review the request and respond.*

  **When will I get a decision once the application is submitted?**

  *You will receive a decision approximately two weeks after you apply. Decisions will take slightly longer over a holiday.*

  **Will I receive credit for the courses I take?**

  *If you take a credit-bearing class and pass it, you will receive college credit at Fordham. Credits taken at Fordham University are typically transferable to other colleges as long as you earn a C or better.*

  **How much work is the program going to be?**

  *The amount of work that is required depends on the course you take. Credit-bearing courses will require regular homework, including, possibly, final projects after your time on campus. Non-credit programs may involve some readings and group projects, which will acclimate you to the kind of work that's done at college.*

  **Do you offer airport pick-ups?**

  *Please be advised that at this time, Fordham is not able to offer airport transfers as part of the program. However, we can provide detailed address information for cabs or ride-share services.*

  ***Do I have to live on campus?***

  *No--commuting is an option for all students.*

  ***What after-class evening programs are offered in the program?***

  *In the evening, Fordham offers college application prep and career exploration in addition to social activities.*

  *Each Summer Leaders Academy Immersion includes time with Fordham's experienced Undergraduate Admission staff, who will walk you through the following:*

  + *Preparing for college including what classes you should be taking in high school*
  + *Creating a list of colleges that starts with setting your college priorities*
  + *Applying to college from essay writing to navigating the financial aid process*

  *Immersions also include time with career counselors from Fordham's Career Center, who will lead you through exercises to help you:*

  + *Identify your natural strengths and interests*
  + *Focus on career paths that align with your personal values*
  + *Cultivate job-ready skills*

  *Don’t worry though! There will be time for fun! Summer Leaders program staff will also host evening and weekend activities. Past events have included movie and karaoke nights with food and snacks. These events in addition to off-campus excursions with program staff allow students to engage socially with their peers while enjoying summer in New York City outside of their academics.*

  ***If I commute, am I eligible to participate in evening programming?****Yes, all Summer Leaders Academy students are eligible to take advantage of the extracurricular programs until 6 pm during the week and on weekends. However, you do need to adhere to residence hall visitation policies.*
* **Can international students participate in this program?**

  *Yes, international students are eligible to participate.*

  *Fordham does not require any specific visa type to attend the Summer Leaders Academy, but we do offer guidance to enable you to make a prudent choice.*

  *Students taking non-credit classes*  
  *Citizens of countries who enjoy the benefits of the Visa Waiver Program may obtain ESTA clearance and enter the U.S. in WT “Waiver Tourist” status. For citizens of countries requiring a visa to enter the U.S., participants may obtain a B-2 “Visitor for Pleasure” visa to enter the U.S.*

  *If you wish, Fordham will also assist you in obtaining an F-1 visa. Once you have paid your program deposit and received confirmation that you are registered**,** please contact the Director of the Office of International Services Sal Longarino at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7cbc8c9c0c6d5cec9c8e7c1c8d5c3cfc6ca89c2c3d2) for next steps.*

  *Students taking credit-bearing classes*  
  *Fordham University issues I-20s to support F-1 visa applications for students taking credit-bearing classes in the one and two-week Immersions of the Summer Leaders Academy, which are considered full-time programs. Please note that F-1s are not available for students taking 5-week courses because those classes do not meet the required number of hours per week for full-time student status.*

  *If you wish to pursue the F-1 visa, please contact the Director of the Office of International Services Sal Longarino at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#593536373e382b303736193f362b3d313834773c3d2c) after you have paid your program deposit and received confirmation that you are registered.*

  **Do you offer airport pick-ups?**

  *Please be advised that at this time, Fordham is not able to offer airport transfers as part of the program. However, we can provide detailed address information for cabs or ride-share services.*

  **What should my English proficiency be to participate?**
