[Featured Students](#sidebar_accordion_copy_content_1)

## Ellen Goncharov

Ellen met with her mentor, Dr. Yusuke Hori at the Stanford Oncology Center. She is feeling further inspired by her topic of research- "Role of stereotactic radiosurgery for radioresistant brain metastases (Melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, Sarcoma, etc.)”

[Past Featured Students](#sidebar_accordion_content_1)

## Soha Budhani

Harris Intern Alum, Soha, joined Dr. Harris and others on Stryker's Mobile Lab.

The Neurotechnology lab is Stryker’s mobile operating room, with six integrated lab stations that allow students to experience Stryker’s line of products. During the visit students received hands-on product demonstrations and a look at the latest innovations in the Neurotechnology space.

"I greatly appreciated the opportunity to see up-close the surgical technologies of the future, and I look forward to using them myself someday soon! I especially enjoyed the final station: carefully grating down the surface of an egg and inscribing an ‘S’ on its shell showed me how incredibly precise and controlled these instruments can be.” - Soha

## Soha Budhani

"I loved working with my mentor, Dr. Lily Kim, delving further into topics of interest, and the freedom of the internship!"

## Ekam Kaur

"I learned so much and connected with incredible people. Seeing neuroscience research from top professionals was inspiring and an unforgettable experience, and it only increased my passion for the field." – Ekam Kaur

## Nainika Srinivasan

Harris Intern and JClub participant, Nainika, is the co-founder of The Neurokidz. The goal of The Neurokidz is to spark curiosity and deepen understanding of neuroscience among young children.

“As a co-founder of The Neurokidz, I have shaped its mission by developing curriculum modules, leading workshops, and creating engaging activities that simplify complex neuroscience concepts for kids. To promote inclusivity, I also focus on outreach initiatives to bring neuroscience education to diverse communities. Participating in the Harris Internship and JClub has increased my knowledge and enthusiasm for neuroscience. I include interesting advancements in neuroscience in my class material, making lessons more engaging and inspiring for young students.

Working with kids and making a meaningful difference in their lives is the most rewarding part of my involvement with The Neurokidz. There’s nothing more fulfilling than seeing the students’ excitement as they proudly show off their brain hats or neuron models to their parents at the end of class.”

## Sofia Gerstein

“As an aspiring neuroscientist, the Neuroscience Forum was an incredible experience to showcase the research project Dr. Llorente and I are working on. I had so much fun learning about all of the new neuroscience discoveries shared at the Forum. My favorite part of the experience was being able to immerse myself in the world of neuroscience and finally meet Dr. Odette Harris in-person, who is an amazing inspiration to me. Seeing the passion of other researchers and neurosurgeons was an unforgettable experience that strengthened my interest in neuroscience.” – Sofia Gerstein

## Araika Ramchandran

2023-2024 Harris Intern, Araika Ramchandran, presented her project *Glioblastoma: A Snapshot into Symptoms and Potential Future Treatments* at the 11th Annual Neuroscience Forum.

## Harris Interns

Harris Interns last year at the forum

## Featured Student

Harris Intern, Avani Ganesan, invited her mentor, Dr. Rukayat Taiwo, to speak to her school club, CogniSquad. Her club discusses newest innovations in neuroscience and their implications in society.

“All of our members LOVED her talk- I am so lucky to have her as my mentor!” – Avani

Avani also helps run Girls Learn International, a club dedicated to improving female access to education.

## Neuroscience Journal Club

Want to join our Club? The Stanford Neuroscience Journal Club allows Stanford faculty to mentor high-school scientists in the critical analysis of a scientific paper and encourage participants to consider a career in the Neurosciences. Our once-per-month meetings offer students an opportunity to read and discuss scientific literature and newsworthy developments in the field of neuroscience in a low-pressure environment, with expert Stanford scientists.

## About Dr. Odette Harris

**The Harris Neuroscience Internship was founded by Stanford Professor of Neurosurgery, [Dr. Odette Harris](https://profiles.stanford.edu/odette-harris) in 2019 as part of a greater effort to introduce girls and under-represented minorities to careers in neuroscience and neurosurgery. Dr. Harris specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and conducts TBI research with a focus on epidemiology and outcomes. In addition to her work as Director of Stanford's Brain Injury Program, she is also Deputy Chief of Staff, Rehabilitation at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System.**
