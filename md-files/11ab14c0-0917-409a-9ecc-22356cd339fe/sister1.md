### Information on How to Apply

The application process differs between senators’ offices, but commonly requires a letter of interest from the prospective page, an official transcript, and letters of recommendation from teachers, mentors, or supervisors. Application deadlines for each session vary by each office.

Students who wish to apply for a Senate page position, and meet the eligibility requirements listed, may find their senators’ websites using the button below. Many offices provide information on their application process online, however not all senators sponsor pages.

Students who are interested in the legislative process, and are seeking an opportunity for personal growth, are encouraged to apply directly to their senators’ offices. **The Page Program does not have a list of senators who sponsor pages.****Please do not send application materials to the Page Program.**
