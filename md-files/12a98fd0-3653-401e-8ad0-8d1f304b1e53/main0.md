>
> **Session A:** May 25 - June 26, 2026
>
> **Session B:** June 29 - July 31, 2026

Yale Summer Session admits visiting students in three rounds: Priority, Regular, and Rolling. Apply early to secure your preferred courses.

## Application Requirements

Below is a list of the required documents for your application, along with additional details on specific requirements for pre-college students applying to attend in-person courses.

> [cal] Please refer to [Dates and Deadlines](/apply/dates-and-deadlines-orig "Dates and Deadlines") for all of the relevant deadlines. All supporting documentation must be received on or before the application deadline. Below the requirement list, we provide further explanation about some of the requirements.

### Requirements for Pre-College Student Applications

1. Online Application
2. High School Transcript in English with at least 2.5 years of grades. Please [contact us](/about/contact-yale-summer-session "Contact Yale Summer Session") if your transcript does not have at least 2.5 years of grades.
3. Two Letters of Recommendation from a teacher, guidance counselors, or academic advisor. One recommendation must be from a current teacher.
4. Valid U.S. based health insurance card (for students from the U.S.)
5. Optional standardized test scores as described below.
6. Photo ID: Acceptable forms include a driver’s license, passport, other government-issued ID, or official school ID.

### Yale Summer Session’s Test-Flexible Policy

Submitting standardized test scores is strongly encouraged, but not required. Applicants may choose from five options to submit scores:

* ACT
* Advanced Placement (AP)
* International Baccalaureate (IB)
* SAT
* PSAT

Applicants who choose to submit AP or IB scores should include results from all subject exams taken before applying. Those submitting ACT, PSAT, or SAT scores may also include any AP or IB scores of their choice.

Please note that, while the submission of standardized test scores is entirely optional, such scores can offer Yale Summer Session's admissions team additional insight into an applicant's academic background. All applications are evaluated holistically, so there are no fixed score requirements or "cut-offs" for admission. Applicants who have not yet taken any of the standardized tests listed, or who elect not to disclose their scores, are welcome to move forward and submit their applications for review. Once submitted, no applications will be held for, or re-reviewed based on, pending or new test scores.

### Additional Application Requirements for Attending In-person

[Immunization records](/admitted-students/immunization-requirements "Immunization Requirements") for students who will study in-person with us and live on or off campus.

> [point] Be sure to read about [Yale Summer Session's immunization requirements](/admitted-students/immunization-requirements "Immunization Requirements") for students applying to take in-person courses or be on the Yale campus. This requirement will need to be fulfilled after admission but before arrival to Yale.

## Academic Information for Pre-College Students

In the online application, you’ll select courses for credit or choose a program. We recommend reviewing course descriptions on the [YSS Courses for Credit site](/academics/courses-credit "Courses for Credit") beforehand to ensure you choose the best fit for your academic goals. Please note that some courses are not open to pre-college students, so be sure to check the individual course descriptions for any restrictions.

Once admitted to a course or program, you will be officially enrolled in Yale Summer Session. If you decide not to attend after admission, you must withdraw by submitting the [Change Form on the Yale Summer Session website](/academics/changes-and-withdrawals "Changes and Withdrawals").

Full-time study for pre-college students requires enrollment in two courses (2 credits) per session, which is also the maximum allowed. Pre-college students living on campus must take two courses to maintain full-time status. You may take two in-person courses or one in-person course and one online course in the same session.

### What kind of transcript do I submit?

An unofficial transcript or academic record in English is required as part of your application to Yale Summer Session. The online application enables you to upload an unofficial copy of your academic transcript.

Pre-College students submit your high school transcript containing 2.5 years of grades, including your Fall 2025 grades.

> All academic transcripts must show the name of the institution, dates of enrollment, and the subjects or courses taken, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject and the final grade.

Applications are evaluated holistically, therefore, we do not have a G.P.A. requirement.

## For In-person Study: Insurance, Vaccinations, and Required Forms

### Required Health Insurance

You are required to be enrolled in U.S. based health insurance for the duration of the session. We will ask you to upload your valid insurance card as part of your online application. Students coming to study in-person from abroad should review the [visiting international student page](/apply/visiting-international-students "Visiting International Students") for information about the Yale Summer Session insurance for international students.

[Health Insurance](/admitted-students/health-and-safety "Health and Safety ")

[Immunization](/admitted-students/immunization-requirements "Immunization Requirements")

> [link] Review all [vaccination information and the relevant deadlines](/admitted-students/immunization-requirements "Immunization Requirements") to submit your information and be verified so that you can successfully attend Yale Summer Session in-person. Any delay in providing this information may cause you to have to withdraw from YSS if you cannot be verified in time.

## Residential Information for Pre-College Students

If you're a pre-college student, including a recent high school graduate, you'll be required to live on campus if you're taking in-person courses, unless you live with your family within commuting distance of New Haven. If you're enrolled in only online courses, you’re not required to live on campus. Students living on campus must enroll in two courses per session.

You are expected to remain on campus overnight, except when participating in Yale Summer Session activities or with written permission from your parent or guardian to leave for a specified period. Yale undergraduates serve as residential counselors to provide support and assistance.
