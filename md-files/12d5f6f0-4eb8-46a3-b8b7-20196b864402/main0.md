# AIM Summer Program

Lazy summers are for lazy people, not you. You’re driven to do something greater.

The Academy Introduction Mission (AIM) is a one-week summer program where you’ll immerse yourself in Academy life. AIM is exclusively for students entering their senior year of high school and is regarded as the most realistic of the service academy summer orientation programs.

AIM will test and inspire you. It will push you to your limits. You’ll rise early. You’ll study. You’ll compete. For six nonstop days, you’ll test your mind, body, and spirit in every way as you learn the meaning of *college exceeded*.

Intense and rewarding, AIM will help you to discover whether the Academy experience is truly what you want from college and whether you have what it takes to succeed.
