# Frequently Asked Questions

## Program Information

Q: How many people attend the program?

A: Typically, there will be about 200 students attending each week of AIM, so a total of about 600 students for the on-campus program. Additionally, several hundred will attend the Virtual AIM session if they are unable to attend an on-campus session.

Q: How does attending AIM strengthen my application to the Coast Guard Academy?

A: AIM is a great opportunity to get a glimpse into what it is like to be a cadet. During your time at AIM, you will learn more about Academy life, our majors, engineering programming, and waterfront activities. If you later choose to apply to the Coast Guard Academy, your AIM evaluation is attached to your application. Attendance at AIM does not guarantee admission to the Academy. Many of our current cadets attended AIM, but there are also many Academy cadets who did not participate in AIM.

Q: How does the AIM program prepare you for Swab Summer?

If you attend AIM, you will be going into the training environment, but it is much shorter and less intense than Swab Summer. At AIM, you’ll receive training from your cadre on how to act like a cadet and have time to practice those skills. It may be stressful at times, but you are learning how to work as a team.

Q: What is the schedule for the online version of AIM?

A: Virtual AIM is two full days of programming, generally from 9am-4pm EST with scheduled breaks. During this program, you’ll hear from admissions officers, engineering faculty, and current cadets to give you a sense of what it is like to attend the Academy.

Q: What programs do you have for my parents while I’m attending AIM?

A: The last day of your AIM session is Family Day. Your parents will have a chance to walk around campus, hear about your week and attend your graduation ceremony before you end the program. It’s a great opportunity for your parents to see what the Academy is all about!

Q: Besides physical preparation, is there anything else I could be doing to help prepare for AIM?

A: Prior physical preparation is a key part of having a positive experience at AIM. Please be sure to read through the AIM handbook and other details on our website to ensure you are prepared. Please also be aware the weather in New London is typically hot and humid in the summer. AIM can give you a good opportunity to learn more about the Coast Guard Academy, and to help with your decision-making as to whether a service academy is the right fit for you.

## Application & Review Process Information

Q: I’m having some technical issues with the application. What can I do?

A: Here are a few things you can try: clear the cache, clear cookies, or try a different browser. If you are still encountering technical issues, please contact us at [AIM@uscga.edu](mailto:AIM@uscga.edu "AIM Email address").

Q: Do we have to wait for the recommendations to be received before submitting the application?

A: No. Your recommender can submit their letter after you submit your application, but their recommendation needs to be submitted by April 1st. On your application, you put in the recommender’s email and then our system generates an email with a link to submit.

Q: Can we use the same recommendations for AIM that we do for the CGA application?

A: You can use the same recommenders if you wish, but you will still need to put their email in the CGA application, and they will need to upload it. It does not get carried over from your AIM application.

Q: Can I submit additional recommendations besides the required guidance counselor recommendation?

A: Yes. The guidance counselor recommendation is the only required recommendation, but if you would like to submit an additional recommendation from a teacher, coach, employer, or from a personal reference who knows you well, you can also submit their recommendation under the optional portion of the application.

Q: If I am homeschooled, who can I ask to write my recommendation?

A: If you’re homeschooled, you can have your parent submit a letter because they are acting in the capacity as your counselor. If you belong to a homeschool co-op or network where you have an organizer, that person can submit your recommendation.

Q: I’m taking the March SAT for the first time. Should I wait to complete my application until scores are available?

A: Both the PSAT and SAT scores are optional for your AIM application. Scores are typically released approximately two weeks after the exam, so you can wait to see your scores and still have time to submit them before the AIM application deadline.

Q: Will there be a place on the application to indicate they are a CGJROTC cadet?

A: Yes, there’s an extracurricular section where you can add pertinent activities like CGJROTC, Sea Scouts, etc., and you can also write about these activities in your personal statement.

Q: Should I complete the optional components of the application?

A: Optional components are optional. However, providing additional information does help us get to know you as a candidate, so if you feel that additional context would be helpful, then you can include it. We are looking for engaged students who are involved in their schools and communities and have strong academic merit.

Q: Can I edit the application once I’ve submitted it?

A: No, but you can email [AIM@uscga.edu](mailto:AIM@uscga.edu "AIM email adress") if you have any supplemental information you would like to add to your application.

Q: For the GPA question, are you looking for a weighted or unweighted GPA?

A: We look at your unweighted GPA.

Q: When do you send out decisions?

A: We will release decisions by 05 MAY.

## Medical Information

Q: When do we submit our medical history & clearance forms and insurance information?

A: Acceptance letters are released first, and then you’ll submit this information in conjunction with your tuition payment.  Forms are due 30 MAY.

Q: I had a physical last year. Will that be sufficient for the medical forms?

A: You will need a current physical dated 01 AUG 2024 or later.
