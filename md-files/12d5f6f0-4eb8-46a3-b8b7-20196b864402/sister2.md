* Unmarried, not pregnant, and have no legal obligations to support anyone including a child
* Physically fit, in good health, with weight proportional to height
* Of good moral character
* Academically successful with demonstrated leadership skill and achievement outside the classroom

If you are using a Macintosh with Safari as the browser and encounter difficulties, shift to Firefox. For technical assistance, please call 860-444-8503.

Because space is limited, some applicants are not selected to participate in AIM.

Those not selected for AIM are encouraged to accept the Academy’s invitation for priority registration to the fall season Cadet for a Day overnight program.

*“I had my mind set on being a naval officer and attending the Naval Academy. AIM was a game changer for me; I honestly believe the Coast Guard is indisputably the best military service branch because of the opportunities and experiences it offers to hardworking, dedicated people.”*Erin
