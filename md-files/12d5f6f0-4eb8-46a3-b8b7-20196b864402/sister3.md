*“From sailing on the Thames River, doing the Physical Fitness Exam, marching around the campus, and all the engineering and FIT classes, AIM was a week I will not forget. The cadre were very encouraging, making sure that we always were striving to do our best and would help us improve when we slipped up.”* Lucy
