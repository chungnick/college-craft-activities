Rising high school juniors and seniors have various options to engage with UMass Lowell over the summer while also earning college credit.

## UPRISE: Understanding Power, Resisting Injustice, Summer Experience

During this 3-week experience, you will learn how to become an effective agent of social change while also earning college credit. In this program you will spend your first two weeks living and learning on campus and will be led by faculty from our Department of Sociology and Labor Studies Program. While living with other emerging activists you will attend classes with experts in issues of social justice and will also connect with local and state community organizations and leaders. After two weeks on campus, you will have the analytical tools to understand social problems and the skills to resist injustice. In the final week of this program, you will continue working with others on your group project while attending virtual, or in-person, meetings with UMass Lowell faculty members. UPRISE will hold a showcase experience where students will present their group work to UMass Lowell community members and their families and will be followed by the Successfully Launched BBQ.
