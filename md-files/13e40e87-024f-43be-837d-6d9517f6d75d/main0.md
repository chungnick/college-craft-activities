## Program Format & Subject Areas

As a student in the College Prep Program, you’ll take one 3- or 4-credit course and are required to participate in College Prep Seminars.

### College Credit Courses (Required)

You’ll have the opportunity to take a credit course\* from a curated list of eligible courses. Credit courses are scheduled each day, Monday through Thursday, and meet for two hours per class, for a total of eight hours of class per week. Homework could include readings, essays, research papers, group projects, quizzes, midterms, and final exams. You should plan to study and work on assignments for 18 hours a week.

*\*To satisfy visa requirements, international students receiving visa assistance from Georgetown will be enrolled in a second credit course. Please refer to the* [*How to Apply*](https://summer.georgetown.edu/programs/SHS05/college-preparatory-program/how-to-apply/) *page for additional details.*

## College Prep Seminars (Required)

Seminars, which are required, cover three areas:

### Academic & Test Prep

This seminar series will begin in the second week of the program. Led by experienced academic professionals, teachers, and test prep instructors from [Capital Educators](https://capitaleducators.com/), you’ll learn in small groups, where you’ll benefit from personalized attention. At the conclusion of the program, you’ll receive a detailed final report that highlights areas of your progress in different academic subjects, as well as customized suggestions for how to continue studying for the SAT/ACT. You’ll also receive a comprehensive manual, instructional flashcards, and a collection of official exams, which will offer continued support in the weeks leading up to the SAT and ACTs. Seminars will provide instruction in five main areas:

* **High School Foundations:** Review of critical content in Algebra I, Algebra II, and English grammar conventions
* **College Language Skills:** Dedicated time focused on analytical reading and essay writing
* **Recitation Blocks:** Focused attention and guidance to ensure students are making progress, meeting learning objectives, and staying on top of course material
* **Diagnostic Testing:** You’ll sit for full-length diagnostic exams.
* **Test-Taking:** Strategies and Techniques for the SAT and ACT

### College Search & Beyond Academics

College Search and Beyond Academics

This series features weekly small-group seminars led by the Academic Director and the mentor team. The seminars introduce students to important skills, techniques, and approaches for success in the college search—and once they arrive on campus. Each student will complete five seminars from a list of available topics. Topics may include:

* **College Search:** College search basics, finding the right fit, planning your application, writing the application essay, Georgetown admissions
* **Beyond Academics:** Goal setting, the science of studying, resilience, managing stress, thriving on campus, the Georgetown student experience, and effective note-taking

## Additional Program Options

Students enrolled in College Prep also have access to the University Writing Center and can enroll in the College Admissions Workshop.

### University Writing Center

All College Prep students have access to the University Writing Center, a free service offered by trained Georgetown University students and faculty. Regardless of how little or how much progress you have made on an assignment, the Writing Center can help with all aspects of the writing process and is designed to help you improve your critical thinking, revision, and editing skills. If you already have a draft of your personal statement for college applications, the Writing Center can assist with editing your draft.

### College Admissions Workshop for Rising Seniors

If you are a rising senior, two optional college application assistance seminars are available for an additional fee of $295. These sessions will cover the personal statement for the common application (selecting a topic, writing the essay, and receiving a detailed critique and editing of student essays), as well as putting together a resume and practicing for college interviews. These two sessions will each be three hours in length and will not conflict with credit courses or College Prep Seminars.

> It was amazing to be surrounded by such high caliber students and staff who were all encouraging and fabulous to work with. I took away many positive things from my week as a Summer Hoya.
