## Additional Information

### Application Process

Summer Credit applications are reviewed starting in late November.

Please allow up to three weeks after we have received your completed application for an admission decision to be emailed to you. Your application will only be reviewed and considered complete if all steps of the application process are completed by deadline.

**Note:** Email is the primary form of communication throughout the application and admission process. We strongly recommend that you double-check your Spam folder for potential missed emails from the University. Only the primary email address listed in the application will receive the automatic communications and application updates. Please ensure that both parent/guardian and student emails are entered correctly on the application. If there is a change in either email address, please inform our office immediately at [highschool@georgetown.edu](mailto:highschool@georgetown.edu).

* An unofficial or official transcript with all course grades from year 9 (high school freshman) through the present. Rising freshmen should submit a middle school transcript.

* Course descriptions, books used, and methods of formal academic evaluation.
* Detailed information about the homeschooling program or agency providing the program. In the event that the program is not being offered and certified by an outside agency and local/state board, the professional/academic qualifications of the homeschool provider must be included. Additionally, copies of any local/state waivers received by the program must be included in the file. This information helps our Admissions Office ensure equity and fairness.\*
* An unofficial or official transcript from any courses that have been taken at a local college.

\*Georgetown respects and values homeschool programs, and we welcome applications from homeschooled students. We recognize that homeschool programs can vary based upon individual local/state rules and regulations. Please note: Our high school programs are offered by, and adhere to, federal rules and regulations and those instituted within the District of Columbia. Local/state rules and regulations for homeschool programs outside of D.C. do not necessarily apply to our admissions process and procedures.

### International Students

### English Proficiency

If English is not the primary language of instruction at your high school, please submit English proficiency examination scores from one of the following exams, along with the rest of your application materials:

* TOEFL scores: We require a minimum score of 90 (iBT)
* IELTS scores: We require a minimum score of 7.0
* Duolingo: We require a minimum score of 115

Please note that TOEFL scores expire after two years, and we require valid, unexpired score reports.

### Visa Information

[Visa Information](https://scs.georgetown.edu/admissions/international-students/visas-immigration-documents/?tblci=GiCXtAkbshU2BGWwRSrCBF4Sw6XrdGtF8Yz8Nci-T-1f9yCexz0oxJ6p9eLoosRUMKMJ): Apply for an immigration document should you require a student visa to the United States. Georgetown highly encourages summer students to apply for F-1 visas for participation in all academic sessions over the summer. Instructions on how to submit required documents will be provided by the [Office of Global Services](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/vsqoip/?tblci=GiCXtAkbshU2BGWwRSrCBF4Sw6XrdGtF8Yz8Nci-T-1f9yCexz0oxJ6p9eLoosRUMKMJ).

Georgetown will not provide visa assistance for international students enrolled in online courses only. International students enrolled in on-campus classes are required to have an F-1 Visa, and be enrolled in at least 6 credits (or two 3-credit courses).

Please allow at least six weeks for the processing of immigration documents. For Summer College and College Prep students, we recommend applying before April 15.

All admitted international students studying in F-1 status must attend a mandatory immigration orientation session upon arriving at Georgetown. The date and time of this session will be announced via email.
