Below is a list of courses for Summer 2026.

## Adv Germ II:Stories/Histories

This course is the second half of the two-part course sequence at Level III. The course is designed to provide students thorough exposure to contemporary historical and social issues in Germany from 1945 to the present. In Advanced II, the students explore the following two themes:
• Fall of the wall and its consequences
• Germany: en route to a multi-cultural society
Drawing on the dual meaning of the German word Geschichte (i.e., history and story), the theme-oriented instructional units in Level III emphasize personal and public stories in German history, while connecting oral narratives with written narratives. Students improve their ability to narrate, compare and contrast and establish causal relationships in speaking and writing. Through the integration of all modalities, this course promotes accuracy, fluency and complexity in language use. The development of advanced reading and writing is considered the primary means for expanding students' language abilities at this level of language instruction.
By the end of Level III, students will
• have an understanding of post-war historical events and of contemporary life in Germany;
• know how to approach authentic materials (television, news programs; videos) and use acquired knowledge to discuss and understand related issues;
• produce paragraph-length dialogue, moving from the personal to the public narrative and to the formulation of argument and critical analysis in a formal setting;
• possess knowledge of phrases necessary to engage in meaningful interactive discussion;
• read non-fiction and literary texts independently;
• improve their writing abilities through regular composition assignments
• possess strategies for vocabulary building and reading.

Visiting students and students who have not taken German at Georgetown must take placement test prior to registering. Please contact Director of Curriculum, Prof. Marianna Ryshina-Pankova, at ryshinam@georgetown.edu for instructions on completing the placement exam.

## Comparative Political Systems

This course offers a broad introduction to comparative politics, the subfield of political science concerned mainly with political ideas, institutions, and behavior within states. The course examines such themes as the origins and functions of states, formal institutions such as legislatures and executives, the variety and impact of electoral systems, the nature of democracy and autocracy, internal and external challenges to political order, and the impact of international and domestic factors on state performance. Discussions of theoretical and cross-regional issues will be accompanied by treatment of individual countries and contexts. This course counts for the Comparative Government distribution requirement.
This course has been renumbered, effective Fall 2014. A student who earned credit for GOVT 121 Comparative Political Systems in a prior term should not enroll and cannot earn credit in this class.

## Econ Principles Micro

This course first develops simple graphical and mathematical models of decision-making by individual economic agents: consumers, workers, and businesses. We analyze interactions between these agents in product and factor markets using concepts of market demand, supply, and equilibrium. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of perfectly competitive markets, describe the conditions under which that efficiency arises, and examine market failures that occur when those conditions are not met.

## Elements of Political Theory

Who should rule? This is, in many ways, the fundamental question of politics that has been animating political thought to this day. Should it be the few or the many? The most virtuous or the most calculating? Or should we decide who rules by lot? In the course of considering this fundamental question of politics, we will come upon others: Do you have to obey an unjust law? Where does the legitimacy of the modern state come from? Are we tied to one another through a social contract? Who is included in such a social contract, who is excluded? What would true emancipation require? In pursuing these thematic questions, we will proceed both conceptually and in chronological order from antiquity to modernity, emphasizing both philosophical and historical approaches to political theory. Throughout the course we will explore key concepts such as the social contract, sovereignty, violence, freedom, and equality; we will address the relation between politics and language; and investigate the foundations and meaning of the quest for freedom and equality. Finally, throughout the course we will link these discussions to larger questions of liberalism and democracy. The course will ask you to read difficult texts, but it does not presume any prior experience with political science, political theory, history, or philosophy.

## Environmental Politics

This course will survey the science, economics and politics of the environment.

The course will survey the science, economics and politics of Climate Change. Sources and resources will be provided regarding the scientific consensus on climate change as an accelerating and perhaps irreversible threat to human civilization.The solution to Climate Change is not mysterious: Decarbonization, i.e. reducing to zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere and removing from the atmosphere GHGs already stored there. What is involved in decarbonization – and why is it so incredibly hard? To answer this, the analysis and the estimates of the economics and politics of climate change will be reviewed.The climate is a global public good, and Climate Change – to which countries and people contribute unequally, and by which they are affected asymmetrically – a textbook case of a problem without borders that can be solved only through international cooperation. National efforts are essential, yet insufficient. The history of multilateral prevention efforts will be retraced and their promise and problems explored.The scope of technical solutions to decarbonization – energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, carbon capture and sequestration, geoengineering – will be surveyed. The consequences of inadequate policy responses to climate change will be explored.5 seats are reserved for high school students

## Hist Focus:American Revolution

HIST 1099 is one of the required core classes in History for students in the College of Arts & Sciences and the SFS. All sections fulfill the same role, though each instructor will develop a specific topic. Please see individual section description or online syllabi for more information. The general aim is to introduce students to various elements of historical work and thinking, within the context of looking at a particular historical period, event, or theme in some depth. Though lectures and discussion will focus on particular topics, there will also be labs with class exercises, assignments, and readings that will allow instructors and students to explore how historians identify, define, and employ primary sources of all types, how historians analyze those sources, how they formulate questions, how they engage with the work of prior historians, and how they aim to reconstruct various elements of the human experience in particular times and places. Please note that if you receive AP/IB placement or credit, you cannot take HIST 1099 for credit. HIST 1099 must be taken at GU and cannot be transferred.

This semester, students will apply the historian’s skills and habits of inquiry to the study of the American Revolution. We will begin with the movement of people, commodities, and ideas across the Atlantic Ocean, examine the cultural, political, social, and economic forces that shaped the North American Colonies and led to the War for Independence, and assess the impact of the Revolution on institutions, ideas, and individuals. Students will take on key questions including: When did the American Revolution begin and end? What were its causes and effects? Who were the "winners" and "losers" of the Revolution? How did new forms of freedom and oppression create one another? What difference did it make to the rest of the world and what difference did the rest of the world make to it? What kind of revolution was it -- was it all that "revolutionary" at all? As the American public celebrates the 250th anniversary of many of the events discussed in this class, there is no better time to revisit what we think we know about the past and explain how it is we know it.Some seats in this course are reserved.

## History of China II

HIST 123 History of China II
This course continues from the first part of the Chinese history survey. It is taught with a somewhat different time frame on the main campus and in Doha at SFSQ.
On the main campus: The course is introductory, has no prerequisites, and assumes no prior knowledge of China or its language. The organization of the course is basically chronological, but within that framework we will be approaching China from a wide range of viewpoints, taking up political, economic, social, religious, philosophical, and artistic developments. In the fall semester, we covered the formation of China's social, political, and philosophical culture(s), going as far as the consolidation of imperial autocracy in the Ming dynasty (14th-16th centuries).
This term we will cover roughly four centuries: 1580-1990. We start with both the resilience and weaknesses of China's imperial system during its final quarter-millennium, including the tensions between a "Middle Kingdom" vision of China as a unitary, advanced, and self-sufficient civilization and the realities of the Manchu Qing state as a multi-ethnic empire in growing competition with others. We then take up the challenge to China's traditions and stability posed by internal developments as well as external economic and cultural penetration by a number of "outsiders" in the 19th century. We conclude with China's 20th century experiments in forms of government and search for new directions in social and cultural development, so as to survive, and later thrive, in an increasingly interconnected global environment.
At the Doha campus: China II: Twentieth Century China
The first two decades of the twentieth century shattered all assumptions about what it meant to be “Chinese” and to live in the “Central Kingdom.” The collapse of the imperial system in 1911 brought an end to over two thousand years of successive emperors and dynasties, but little consensus about what the new “Republic of China” would be and do. Was this new “China” an empire or nation? Would it include or exclude Tibet, Mongolia, and the Muslim regions of eastern Turkestan—territories that had become part of the multi-cultural Qing empire (1636-1911). Having abandoned the Confucian education system, what would replace it? What ideology should motivate and discipline the people? Who should serve the state? Who should the state serve? And above all, how would China extricate itself from the hostile international forces that pressed in from all sides? There were no easy answers to these questions. The result was a century of fierce conflicts—a chain of explosions, both metaphorical and real—that tore apart the fabric of society and then rewove it into new patterns.
This course will examine the last century of Chinese history by focusing on individual and everyday human experiences as revealed by a variety of primary sources—journals, works of art, poetry, novels and memoirs, music, and government documents. We will discuss major polit

We will discuss major political figures such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, but also explore the lives of the educated elite—the intellectuals and officials who carried out their policies. This course will also pay particular attention to the history of women and minority groups such as Tibetans and Muslims.

## Interm Germ II: Exper Germ

This course is the second half of the two-part course sequence at Level II. The course is organized topically to familiarize students with contemporary life in the German-speaking world. In Intensive Intermediate, students explore the following themes:
• Nature, people, environment
• Fairy tales
• The German-speaking world from a view of a foreigner
The primary text type that is used at this level to explore each theme is the story, — personal, public and literary stories. Students typically encounter each text first in class and then engage it further out of class in preparation for subsequent in-depth thematic discussions in class. Class discussions often involve role play and/or group work as a way to enhance conversational and negotiating abilities. The course’s emphasis on improving students ability to narrate, compare and contrast, express opinions, and establish causal relationships in speaking and writing lays the groundwork for the historical treatment of stories and histories in Level III.
By the end of the level II students
• will have a good understanding of contemporary life in the German-speaking world with some in-depth knowledge of major social, political and cultural issues;
• will be able to comprehend authentic materials (video, native speaker conversation) with global comprehension and some fine point knowledge analysis;
• will be able to produce spoken and written discourse from description to narration, to formulation of argument and/or hypothesis, incorporating an increasing variety of style and complexity.

## Intermediate French II

Non-Intensive Intermediate French II (FREN 022) builds on Non-Intensive Intermediate French I (FREN 021) and its presentation of French and Francophone cultures through various themes, the study and practice of fundamental vocabulary to explore these themes, and essential grammatical structures. FREN 022 provides students with a solid foundation for pursuing further study of the language and culture at the Advanced level (FREN 101 or FREN 111).
The prerequisite for this course is the successful completion of Intermediate French I (FREN 021) at Georgetown, a score of 56-65 on the French Placement or Confirmation Exam (see the departmental web page), or a recommendation from a Georgetown University French Department instructor.

International relations, as a field of political science and a discipline in the social sciences, attempts to explain and understand in a systematic fashion relationships among human beings and institutions in the global arena, such as international (inter-state) relations and relations including non-state actors, such as international organizations and non-governmental organizations. This course will introduce the student to the basic theoretical concepts, historical material, and problems and issues that affect contemporary foreign affairs and international relations, especially since the end of the Cold War twenty years ago. In doing this, a number of aspects will be examined: international political economy, foreign policy, international ethics, the use of force, human rights, international organizations, globalization, and the relationship between the industrialized states and the developing countries. The course is divided into three parts. The first part introduces the study of international relations in general, including theories of international relations as well as the major actors: nation-states, great powers, non-state actors, and the international system and society. The second part refers to international security (war and peace) and to international political economy. Finally, the third part refers to globalization and to global issues (such as environment, demography, and human rights), suggesting avenues for future research and alternative futures for global politics.

## Intro Germ II: Contemp Germany

Part 2 of Level I. The two-course sequence of Level I introduces students to various aspects of the German-speaking world as a way of enabling them to begin building communicative abilities in German in all four language modalities: reading, listening, writing, and speaking. Instruction proceeds from guided to more creative and independent work. The courses incorporate a variety of activities that are based on a range of topics, text types, and different socio-cultural situations. Through diverse collaborative and individual tasks, students begin to find personal forms of expression that are based on these materials. Students learn basic strategies for reading, listening, and writing, and for participating in every-day conversations. In the process they become familiar with and learn to use with some confidence the major sentence patterns and grammatical features of German as well as high-frequency vocabulary of everyday life. Integration of current technology (e.g., the Internet, e-mail, video) familiarizes students with the German-speaking world while at the same time enhancing language learning.

Visiting students and students who have not taken German at Georgetown must take the placement test prior to registering. Please contact Director of Curriculum, Prof. Marianna Ryshina-Pankova, at ryshinam@georgetown.edu for instructions on completing the placement exam. Part 2 of Level I.

## Law and Justice

How have societies across time and in different places developed and practiced law? What can cross-cultural comparison and the use of ethnographic methods reveal about law, legality, and notions of justice? And how might these insights inform contemporary debates around criminal justice reform, freedom of speech, or attempts to address global economic inequality? In this course, students will embark on a critical introduction to legal anthropology. Course readings will immerse students in the ways different cultures have devised legal systems to resolve social conflict, prosecute and punish crime, create categories to organize social relations such as across gender or race, and to secure and maintain political legitimacy. We will also examine contemporary approaches to the anthropological study of law by looking at cutting-edge research underway including indigenous rights, international criminal law enforcement, transnational financial and economic regulation, migration, and the role of contemporary social movements in the United States, like Black Lives Matter, and globally, like climate change activism, to bring law closer to justice.

## ReExmn Isr-Pal Crisis:Lit/Film

This course will examine how Israeli and Palestinian literatures depict the “other” through text and image, from the early years of Zionism to the twenty-first-century. Using the methodologies of comparative studies, we will attempt to understand how each nation’s views evolved and changed over time, with a focus on works which shifted these perceptions in revolutionary ways. Various depictions of the “other” will be examined, such as the criminal, noble hero, sexual predator, the lover, the suicide bomber and the ally. We will also discuss how both art forms grappled with the many issues which together contribute to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, including: identity, language, class and the deceptively simple task of defining homeland. Weekly critical readings will include the theoretical ideas of Orientalism and post-colonialism, enabling students to understand both literatures within the wider context of world literature.
Among the authors covered are: Yosef Chaim Brenner, S. Yizhar, Sami Michael, A.B. Yehoshua, Eli Amir, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Hanna Ibrahim, Emile Habibi, Atallah Mansour, Ghassan Kanafani, Mahmoud Darwish, Samir El-Youssef and Sayed Kashua.

## The Problem of God

The Problem of God introduces students to the study of religion and theology, broadly
understood. Our aim in the course is not only to introduce students to different religious
traditions and perspectives, but, as the title of the course suggests, to encourage critical
reflection on some of the most challenging questions relating to religious commitment. In
other words, the goal of the course is not only to help students learn about religious
traditions, but to reflect critically on what it means to be a religious person, what it means
to study religion and theology, and what the significance of religious belief is. It is one of
two courses (along with IBL) that fulfill the first Theology course requirement at
Georgetown, and the importance of promoting critical reflection on religious belief through
this requirement has taken on new meaning in a post-9/11 world, in which religious
literacy and understanding are more important than they have ever been. Mirroring the
diversity of our faculty, the course is taught in a diverse number of ways, including a
variety of different primary texts and focusing on a variety of significant questions relating
to religion and theology. Georgetown graduates consistently report that The Problem of
God was one of the most important courses that they took during their time at Georgetown.

## The U.S. Political System

Government 020 provides students with a broad understanding of the political system in the United States. It is one of the four introductory courses in the Department of Government.
The goal of the class is to train students both as citizens and as scholars. As citizens, students will learn the shared history of U.S. politics and be able to think critically about how the system has succeeded and failed. As scholars, students will be introduced to the theoretical and analytical tools of political science as applied to American government.
By the end of the semester students will
1) Be politically literate, knowing core historical and contemporary facts about the U.S. political system
2) Understand important theories about U.S. politics, including theories about the importance and functioning of political institutions, the roots of popular political preferences, and the functioning and consequences of elections.
