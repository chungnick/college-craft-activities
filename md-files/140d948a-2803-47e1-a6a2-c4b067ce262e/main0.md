## About Summer of Opportunity Program (SOOP)

[Youth Employment Services](/departments/department-recreation-and-human-services-drhs/youth-employment-services "Youth Employment Services") (YES) offers the Summer of Opportunity Program (SOOP) to students ages 14-20 who reside in the City of Rochester.

SOOP collaborates with the RochesterWorks Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) through marketing and a joint youth application. This opportunity allows young people to gain real-world work experience with diverse employers and internship partners from the Greater Rochester community.  

The primary difference between the two programs is eligibility. SYEP requires applicants to meet residency and income guidelines. SOOP only requires residency within the City, no matter which school applicants attend or their family income. **All applicants must be enrolled in middle school, high school, or a high school equivalency program (TASC).**

Youth who reside outside the City of Rochester should visit [Rocsummeryouth.com](https://rocsummeryouth.com/) for more information and resources.

#### The application launches February 9, 2026.
