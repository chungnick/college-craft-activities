# M-ASCEND High School Program

M-ASCEND has two programs for high school students from partner high schools (Brooklyn Center, Central, Harding, Hiawatha, Highland Park, Johnson, Patrick Henry, Roosevelt, South, Washington Tech). Accepted students learn about cancer and cancer research through hands-on programming with University of Minnesota (UMN) faculty and staff. Programs also cover college readiness and cancer research, and healthcare career pathways. These programs are paid to encourage Minnesota students from partner schools, particularly those who have limited access to advanced science or have experienced personal barriers to academic experiences, to pursue careers in research or clinical fields.

## About the High School Internship Opportunity

This is a paid summer internship opportunity for students at least 16 years old who have participated in our M-ASCEND High School Scholars Program. The students who are accepted for the limited spots are official interns with the University of Minnesota. This internship is made up of two parts: over the summer and during the following school year.

The summer internship will be hosted at the University of Minnesota. Interns work in a cohort to complete an individualized research project and present it during the University of Minnesota Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium. Interns also attend workshops on college readiness and career-building, tour University labs, network with professional scientists, complete mini-labs, and learn about cancer and cancer public health topics.

The service-learning program during the following year is an opportunity to build upon the knowledge and skills students learn during the summer internship. They will get hands-on experience with community agencies involved in cancer. M-ASCEND High School Scholars interested in exploring research or clinical careers are encouraged to apply.
