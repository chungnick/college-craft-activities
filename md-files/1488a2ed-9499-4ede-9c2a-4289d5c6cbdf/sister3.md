# FAQ – High School Students

#### Who is eligible to enroll in Summer Session for-credit courses?

Current 10th and 11th grade students are eligible to apply to a selection of six-week courses for credit. Participants must be 16-years-old by the first day of the term to be eligible. There are no exceptions to this university policy.

Credit courses include on-campus options for local commuters and online options for non-commuters, including international high school students.

Summer Session courses are also open to currently enrolled Duke and DKU undergraduate students, and undergraduate students at other universities (i.e. not seeking their degree at Duke). **High school participants will be in courses with undergraduate college students**.

#### Can international high school students enroll in Duke Summer Session?

International high school students are eligible to enroll in Duke’s online for-credit course options.

Eligible applicants whose first language is not English will be required to provide [English Language Proficiency test scores.](https://summersession.duke.edu/language-proficiency-high-school)

#### What is the tuition rate and required fees for summer 2025?

High school students are eligible to enroll in regular, non-lab courses. The tuition for each course is $2,970.

Transcript Fee: $120 (one-time fee for life-time transcripts)

#### When will I be able to see my tuition and fees on my student account? What is the payment deadline?

Term 2-Bill date: May 15

Due date: June 12

If you are enrolled after the bill date, your tuition may not appear in your student account. Our office will share directions for how you can make your payment.

**Visiting high school students with outstanding tuition and fee balances on the last day of Drop/add will be dropped from their course(s).**

#### Is financial aid available to high school students?

Scholarships and/or financial aid are not available to high school students who are taking Duke University courses for credit. High school students who would like to have a non-credit Duke experience and possibly receive financial aid can explore [Duke Pre-College’s High School Program](https://learnmore.duke.edu/about/duke-pre-college-high-school-program).

#### Are residential options available to high school students?

No. Duke Summer Session credit courses are available to current 10th - 11th grade students who are local commuters or who would like to take a Duke course online. High schoolers cannot live on campus while taking a Duke undergraduate course.

If you are a high school student who would like to have a non-credit, residential experience at Duke University, please see [Duke Pre-College.](https://learnmore.duke.edu/precollege)

#### How do I select my courses?

Select Term 2 credit courses are available to high school students to enroll in as local commuters or as online students. Options include courses from across the arts and sciences.  Carefully review course details and make sure the mode of delivery and meeting schedule is appropriate for your summer plans. Questions about specific courses may be directed to [summer@duke.edu](mailto:summer@duke.edu). 

#### Will my Duke course credit transfer to my undergraduate institution after I graduate from high school?

Transfer credit is determined by the receiving institution. We encourage you to discuss transferring your Duke University credit as you apply to or when you are accepted into an undergraduate institution.

#### What materials do I need to participate in my course?

Instructors will provide a syllabus with details regarding any course materials you may need.

Other necessary materials include:

* Online: speakers or headphones to hear instructors during live, synchronous meetings, and a microphone and webcam so you can fully participate
* Commuter & Online: internet access and a computer that allows you to check your Duke email, take notes, use Zoom, find and download research articles etc.

Technical requirements related to the materials above that you should have access to before enrolling in a course include the following: 

* Computer running one of the following operating systems:  
  + Windows 7 or newer.
  + Mac OSX 10.10 or newer.
  + 1 GB RAM available.
  + 2 GHz or faster processor.
* Internet
  + Consistently reliable internet with at least 2k kbps available bandwidth.
  + Chrome browser, latest two versions, with cookies enabled.

#### Can I take a Duke University course for credit if I have other obligations during the summer?

The academic rigor of Summer Session courses is the same as during the traditional academic year. Both commuters and online students should be aware that you are taking a regular undergraduate Duke course delivered at an accelerated pace.

**Your Summer Session course should be your top priority over the summer so you can get the most from your academic experience.**

Students who attempt challenging schedules with multiple priorities (particularly those who believe online courses may require less of their time) frequently struggle to meet the demands of their multiple priorities.

#### Is there a chance that courses could be canceled due to low enrollment?

If we do not have sufficient enrollment, we may make the decision to cancel the course. Decisions regarding cancellation of Term 2 courses are made two weeks before courses start. 

#### Can I change or drop my Duke University course?

Drop/add (dropping one class and adding another class in its place) may be done prior to the beginning of the term or during the first three days of the term. There are no financial charges for dropping and adding. A high school student who would like to drop their course and add a different one must be eligible for the new course in order to enroll. Please see course descriptions on the Summer Session website to determine any prerequisites.

#### What if I need to withdraw from my Duke University course?

After the first three days of the term when Drop/add ends, students may withdraw from their course(s) for compelling reasons. Visiting high school students should contact the Summer Session Office.

**Term 2 Withdrawal deadline**

Students will receive a "W" for each course withdrawn on their official transcript. There is a financial obligation of full tuition and fees for withdrawing from a course. No refunds are possible.

Summer Session reserves the right to withdraw students from classes if they never attend, have not paid tuition and fees, or if they fail to clear with the bursar by the end of the Drop/add period. Attendance in classes after the first three days of the term financially obligates the student for 100% of the tuition charge and the Transcript Fee. No tuition is refunded after the third day of each term.

#### What is DukeHub and why do I need access?

DukeHub is the self-service application providing students with an array of information and direct access to their academic, financial, and personal data. Access to DukeHub is gained by the use of your NetID and password. Using DukeHub, students can view the course schedule, check their financial account and review their grades. Duke degree students use DukeHub to register for classes; however visiting students must do that through the Summer Session office.

You will have access to DukeHub after you have received an email containing your Net ID and password information from Duke’s Office of Information Technology (OIT).

The Summer Session Office is unable to troubleshoot issues relating to your email or DukeHub access. If you experience issues with DukeHub or your Duke email please contact the [OIT service desk](https://oit.duke.edu/help).

#### What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

In order to access DukeHub and your Duke email, you will be required to set-up a security feature called [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/multi-factor-authentication). To register, you will be prompted to enter your NetID and password. If you cannot access this site, call OIT at 919-684-2200 for assistance.

After you login, you will see links on the right-hand side of the page that allow you to add devices. For example, if you choose to Add a Smart Phone or Tablet, you will then be taken to a screen that prompts you to answer these questions:

* What type of device do you want to register?
* What operating system does this device have?
* 10-digit phone number (Note: International numbers should be entered as + followed by the country code and the rest of the phone number)
* Optional device nickname

After you answer these questions, you will be directed to a page that tells you how to install Duo Mobile. Follow the directions to finish setting up your device.

The Summer Session Office is unable to troubleshoot issues relating to Multi-Factor Authentication. If you experience issues with Multi-Factor Authentication please contact the [OIT Help Desk](https://oit.duke.edu/help).
