# Stanford EXPLORE: A Lecture Series on Biomedical Research For High School Students

The Stanford Explore Lecture Series is an exploratory series covering the basic fundamentals and current research areas represented by the various research areas of the Stanford School of Medicine (Immunology, Neuroscience, Regenerative and Stem Cell Medicine, Cancer Biology, Bioengineering and Bioinformatics). The lectures will be taught by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows along with some lectures taught by Faculty.

The main focus of the series is attending lectures similar to what students will be exposed to in college.  Besides learning about the basic fundamentals of each topic, students will also learn about some of the current research as well as current techniques and applications that are used.  Furthermore, there will be opportunities to learn about the graduate and medical school education pathways from current students.   No homework assignments will be given.  The schedule is 9am-12pm daily as an in-person option as well as option via a virtual zoom webinar format. **Students need to sign up for a minimum of 2 weeks.**  **The online registration will open on MARCH 1, 2026.**

* **TENTATIVE PROGRAM DATES FOR SUMMER 2026:**July 6-31, 2026 (Monday through Friday)

* **ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:** Students must currently be in 9th-12th grade at the time of registration.  Students must also be **U.S. citizens or permanent residents** with a green card **currently** **living in the U.S.** Any student is welcome to register who meet these eligibility requirements.  Many of the lectures will be at a high level so we strongly encourage students to have sufficient preparation in the sciences demonstrated by As and Bs in their science courses and taking at least one year of high school biology before the program.
* **COST: 4 week program (**$3200 in person cost ($800/week); $2400 online version ($600/week)
