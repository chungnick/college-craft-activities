## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Stanford Explore Lecture Series is an exploratory series covering the basic fundamentals and current research areas represented by the various research areas of the Stanford School of Medicine (Immunology, Neuroscience, Regenerative and Stem Cell Medicine, Cancer Biology, Bioengineering, and Bioinformatics). The lectures will be taught by Stanford Faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The program is overseen by Faculty Director Dr. PJ Utz.

---

### **ELIGIBILITY**

**This program is geared for high school students (currently in 9th through 12th grade) at the time of registration.**  Students should also be **U.S. citizens or permanent residents with a green card currently living in the U.S. and attending a high school in the U.S.** Many of the lectures will be at a high level so we strongly encourage students to have sufficient preparation in the sciences demonstrated by mostly As and Bs in their science courses and taking at least one year of high school biology before the program.

---

### **PROGRAM COST**

### $1800 for the VIRTUAL PROGRAM (3 weeks)

### $2400 for the IN-PERSON PROGRAM (3 weeks)

### Starting May 1st, if there are still slots available we will open up the option to sign up for 1 week at at time ($600/week for the online format and $800/week for the in-person program)

### .  There will be NO REFUNDS once you pay.

**FINANCIAL AID (ONLY AVAILABLE FOR THE ONLINE PROGRAM):** Students who lack the means to pay course fees will be considered for full scholarships.  In order to be considered, please fill out the form that can be found on the Slideroom registration site and upload it on the Slideroom registration portal.  Students requesting financial aid will also need dto ask for a reference letter from a teacher which can be done through the Slideroom registration portal.  The aid will be based primarily on the household income (generally full scholarships are only considered for family income under $80,000).  You will be notified of the decision within 1-2 weeks of the receipt of your application.

---

### **HOUSING/TRANSPORTATION**

**The program does not offer housing or transportation**. Families are FULLY RESPONSIBILE FOR TRANSPORTATION AND SUPERVISION BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM HOURS EACH DAY.

---

### **PARKING PERMITS**

Permit information will be sent out to those who sign up for the In-Person program a few weeks before the program starts.
