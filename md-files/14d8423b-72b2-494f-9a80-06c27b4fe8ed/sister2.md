**PLEASE NOTE:**  Only one format can be selected (in-person or virtual).  The fee structure is $600 per week for the virtual series and $800 per week for the in-person series.  Students must take a minimum of 2 weeks but encouraged to take all 4 weeks.

**SUMMER 2026 PLANS (PLEASE READ):  We are planning to have a complete in-person option as well as a virtual zoom webinar program option for the summer of 2026 for 4 weeks (July 6-July 31st, 2026; 9am-12pm PST).  The zoom webinar format will be used for the lectures.  Webinars do not allow for student video/audio so questions during lectures will be submitted through the Q &A feature on zoom.**

* TENTATIVE TOPICS FOR EACH WEEK:
* July 6-10   Immunology/Neuroscience
* July 13-17 Stem Cell/Cancer
* July 20-24 Bioinformatics/Bioengineering

**REFERENCE LETTER:** The letter is **only needed for those who will be asking for financial aid.** You can input the name of the teacher in the Slideroom registration portal (under the references section) and an email will be sent to the teacher.
