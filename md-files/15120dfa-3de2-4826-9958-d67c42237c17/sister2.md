# Financial Aid

The school provides a substantial amount of financial assistance based on both need and merit. We typically give ~$260,000 in financial aid each year.

A full listing of our available awards can be found on our [Awards](https://arch.illinois.edu/culture/awards/) page.

[Non-Illinois Resident and International Student Rates](https://cost.illinois.edu/Home/Cost/N/G/10KS0247MARC/16/120208/120208)

### Graduate aid

Aid for graduate students is offered in the form of assistantships and fellowships. Materials submitted at the time of application to a School of Architecture graduate program serve as an application for all available fellowships. Applicants and students are awarded fellowships on the basis of merit.

Teaching assistantships are applied for each Spring upon the receipt of admission applications. Assistantships are awarded to about 1/8th of our graduate student population.

Please see a full listing of our available awards, along with applications, on our [Awards](https://arch.illinois.edu/culture/awards/) page.

### Graduate assistantships

For Master of Architecture and Master of Science students, graduate assistantships held within the School of Architecture carry a resident base rate tuition waiver and a monthly stipend. Most assistantships in the school are awarded at 25% time, requiring an average of 10 hours of work each week of the appointment.

Graduate assistantships held by Ph.D. students carry a full rate tuition waiver and a monthly stipend. Ph.D. student assistantships vary from 25% to 50% time, requiring an average of 10 to 20 hours of work each week of the appointment.

All students applying for assistantships must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA and must maintain a strong academic record while holding the assistantship. International students must have at least a 24 on the speaking sub section of their TOEFL or an 8 on the speaking sub section of their IELTS. Students who do not have these scores will have the opportunity to take the EPI (English Placement Interview) through the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning. These are available for a limited time every semester and in the summer.

## Scholarships and Funding for Graduate Students

Thanks to the generosity of our alumni and benefactors, the School of Architecture has at least $650,000 to provide each year to support students through numerous scholarships, fellowships, and tuition waivers. In addition to graduate scholarships and fellowships, many graduate students are supported through graduate teaching and research assistantships. These provide tuition remission and a monthly stipend during the term of appointment. A selection of the school’s scholarships and fellowships are listed below.
