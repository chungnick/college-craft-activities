# Apply to Summer Session Pre-College Courses

Rising High School Seniors

Applying to Fordham’s Summer Pre-College Program involves just a few steps, but some of these require planning ahead in order to make sure your application is completed and received by the deadline. Rising seniors will need to submit an unofficial transcript, including fall grades, and an academic writing sample that includes quotations and citation of sources. Rising juniors who wish to apply for credit-bearing classes should also provide a letter of recommendation. Due to limits on enrollment in certain courses, early application is recommended.

The application requires a $75 deposit that will be credited toward your enrollment if you are accepted.

## Notifications

Applicants will be notified of acceptance within two weeks of submitting a completed application. When you are accepted to the program, you will need to indicate your intent to enroll via the application portal and pay a $300 tuition deposit. You will be registered for your preferred class, and you will be sent the details about your Fordham login information, your schedule, and an orientation session.  Bills for the balance of tuition will be sent beginning in May.

***Please note that you must tell us if you do not wish to participate in the program after you have deposited. Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).***

Approval to take a course in the Pre-College program does not imply permanent admission to any college in the University. However, we will be happy to point you in the right direction to apply to Fordham for full-time study if you would like!

Please call 718-817-4665, or email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f586809898908799909491908786b5939a87919d9498db909180) if you have any questions.
