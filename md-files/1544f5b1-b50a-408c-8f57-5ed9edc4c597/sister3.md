# College Courses For High School Students

Attend a Renowned University while in High School

The Pre-College program is a selective program designed to provide rising high school seniors with experience, connections, and knowledge from their participation in one undergraduate college course alongside Fordham students. With online and in-person options, students in NY or around the world have the opportunity to experience a Fordham education. The classes in this section are specially selected for high school students and usually transfer easily to other universities. Five-week classes start July 2, 2024.

[See the Courses](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/college-courses-for-high-school-students/summer-session-pre-college-courses/)

Who Can Apply?

Rising seniors with a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0 (B) or better from accredited secondary schools may apply with a copy of their transcript, including a report card of their fall grades if they are not listed on the transcript, and an expository writing sample that includes quotations and citations. Sophomores (entering junior year) who have an exceptional record of academic performance may apply for special consideration. For rising juniors, a letter of recommendation from a teacher or guidance counselor must be submitted along with a transcript and an expository writing sample.
