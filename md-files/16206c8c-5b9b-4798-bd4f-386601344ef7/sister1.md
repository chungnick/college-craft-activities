### What’s on Your Wish List?

Is there a course you'd like to take over the summer? Do you need to complete a major or General Education requirement to stay ahead of your course load?

Suggest a 2026 summer course by filling out the form below. We'll identify those high-demand courses and pass the requests on to departments to see if they can be offered.

Your input matters! The earlier you submit a course suggestion, the better!
