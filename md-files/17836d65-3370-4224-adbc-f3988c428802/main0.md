## STUDENT QUOTES

“I am incredibly grateful for the chance to further explore my passions in the intersection of business and technology. I enjoyed the balance between the engaging lectures, hands-on labs, interactive guest lectures, and case studies, which allowed us to delve into a myriad of interesting subjects. Through M&TSI, I realized that business and technology are not separate entities— Rather, they fuse into a powerful propellor for change in our society today. Furthermore, I am grateful for the tight-knit community that shaped my experience; I enjoyed meeting incredible world-class professors who are passionate about their fields, bonding with like-minded peers from diverse backgrounds, and connecting with friendly TA’s who want to help us succeed. Throughout this intense and enriching 3-week experience, I learned more about my passions in business and technology than I ever did before. M&TSI provided me with both significant intellectual insights and a community that I want to stay connected with for years to come.” – Amy Zhou, M&TSI 2020

The engineering labs/prototyping taught me valuable problem solving skills, and the business side taught me how to avoid common mistakes entrepreneurs make and how to successfully position a business for market entry. It was a great introduction to entrepreneurship and M&T.”

“M&TSI was a great program for me to learn about the integration of management and technology, Penn, and the “work hard, play hard” philosophy. I met hardworking, insightful people and had a fun, yet intense, three weeks of being in a college environment.”
