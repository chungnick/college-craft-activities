#### How do I apply?

#### Can international students apply?

Accepted international students will receive further details on this process. For Summer 2025, international students are STRONGLY encouraged to apply by the Priority Deadline of January 29th, 2025

#### How do I send my test scores?

Copies of score reports may be uploaded directly to the online application system or emailed to M&TSI@summerdiscovery.com. For the Summer 2025 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional.

#### What does ‘for-credit’ mean?

M&TSI students who successfully complete the program will earn one Penn credit unit (equivalent to one college course). Typically, this credit has been used at Penn and other institutions as a technical elective or general elective. If you have questions about how this credit will transfer to a specific college or university, please contact the Registrar’s Office of that institution.

#### Is there a standard form for teacher recommendations?

Yes. Simply enter the contact email of your recommenders into the application system and they will be notified to upload a letter of recommendation on your behalf. Please note, two recommendations are required for application and at least one should come from a high school teacher in a STEM-focused field.

#### Who do I contact if I have a question about my application materials?

All application questions should be directed to M&TSI@summerdiscovery.com.

Programming and admitted student questions can be directed to the M&T Office by phone (215-898-4145) or [email](mailto: mgtech@seas.upenn.edu).

#### What is the total cost of the summer program? Will I need any extra spending money?

**On-Campus program fees include:**Full academic and term fees including 1 college credit unit from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, use of Penn academic facilities and labs, lab materials, on-campus housing, two meals a day Monday-Friday, two meals on Sunday (no meals Saturday due to excursions/activities), extracurricular activities and trips, student supervision.

#### What will we be doing during the three weeks of the program? Are there any sample schedules I can see?

Completing a college course in three weeks is no mean feat. Most days are spent in lectures and labs. Classes are taught in either a seminar or lecture format. Students will also conduct lab work. To further demonstrate the connections between management and technology, M&TSI will feature a number of guest lectures and simulations. A final team project and presentation are the culminating pieces of M&TSI.

#### Do I need to wait until I have all of my application materials ready before I can apply online?

No, students may start their online application at any time and save their progress along the way. In order to officially submit the application, however, students must upload all required application materials to the system. If additional application materials become available after submission, students may email documents to M&TSI@summerdiscovery.com.

#### Who are the instructors for the summer program?

The principal instructors for M&TSI are Penn professors [Jeffrey Babin](https://eent.seas.upenn.edu/meet-our-faculty/babin/) and [Sid Deliwala](https://detkin.ese.upenn.edu/team/sid-deliwala/). Other faculty members from both the Wharton School and Penn Engineering also participate in M&TSI. Students will hear from the Dean of Penn Engineering and the Vice Dean of the Wharton School as well as the Director of the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology.

#### Where do M&TSI students live and eat?

Students live in Penn dormitories and are provided a meal plan within the undergraduate dining halls during their stay on Penn’s campus. Learn more about [the residential experience](https://globalyouth.wharton.upenn.edu/summer-high-school-programs/the-residential-experience/).

#### How will participating in M&TSI affect my admissions to Penn?

There is no relationship between M&TSI and the undergraduate admissions process. Attending M&TSI does not guarantee acceptance to the M&T undergraduate program.

#### Can I arrive late or leave before the end of the program?
