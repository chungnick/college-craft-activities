# FAQs

Find answers to common questions about the Jerome Fisher M&T program, a premier dual-degree offering from The Wharton School and Penn Engineering.

#### What is the Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology?

The program is a unique, dual-degree educational opportunity with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. Combining the resources and curricula of [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) and the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, M&T students concurrently pursue both a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the Wharton School and either a Bachelor of Science in Engineering or a Bachelor of Applied Science from Penn Engineering, graduating with two full degrees and a broad skill set.

#### How many people apply to the UPenn M&T program?

Each year, thousands of prospective students from across the U.S. and around the globe apply to the Jerome Fisher M&T program at Penn. Our program is highly selective and only the most qualified students are admitted. Each year, we admit 50-55 students to our program.

#### When was the Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology created?

Penn’s M&T program was started in 1977 to fill a growing need for working professionals who could bridge the gap between management and technical disciplines. Dr. William Hamilton served as the program’s first director until he retired in 2015. In 1995, the program adopted its current name after Jerome Fisher (Wharton ’53), founder and chairman of the Nine West Group, donated $5.5 million to endow and support the M&T program.

#### What is the Bachelor of Science in Economics (BSEcon) Degree?

The Bachelor of Science in Economics degree is the undergraduate degree offered by [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of the University of Pennsylvania. The Wharton BS in Economics provides students with fundamental business knowledge along with a concentration in at least one discipline. Students may select concentrations in Accounting, Operations and Information Management, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Management, Marketing, Real Estate, and other areas of business specialization.

#### What is the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) Degree?

The Bachelor of Science in Engineering is the traditional engineering degree and is most appropriate for those considering engineering careers. This program provides intensive study in engineering through ten major curricula offered by The [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/): Bioengineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Digital Media and Design, Electrical Engineering, Networked & Social Systems, Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Systems Science and Engineering.

#### What is the Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) Degree?

The Bachelor of Applied Science degree is an engineering degree designed for students who have strong interests and capabilities in science and mathematics, but who do not plan to pursue engineering careers. This program stresses the importance of technical concepts and skills, without the in-depth specialization in an engineering discipline of the BSE degree. However, each BAS student selects a concentration of study in Biomedical Science, Computer Science, Computational Biology, Computer and Cognitive Science, or Individualized.

#### Why not study engineering as an undergraduate, and then go on for an MBA?

There are significant advantages to pursuing the coordinated undergraduate, dual-degree, Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology, rather than an undergraduate engineering degree followed by an MBA degree. First, it is important to note that many M&T graduates do consider going on to graduate studies, including MBA degrees at top programs. A substantial number choose not to do so because they find that their career progress as M&T graduates matches that of MBA graduates. Wharton undergraduates take the same or similar courses taught by the same faculty as do MBA students in Wharton’s graduate program, so it is not unusual to find M&T graduates on career trajectories that are comparable to MBA graduates. Others who do go on to MBA studies are generally able to place out of basic courses (e.g., Accounting, Economics, Finance, Marketing, Statistics, etc.), enabling them to either shorten their graduate programs and/or take more advanced coursework than their peers, effectively earning a “super MBA.”

A second important advantage is cognitive in nature: M&T students study both quantitative and qualitative subjects concurrently, challenging them to exercise both the right and left hemispheres of their brains on a daily basis, and encouraging broad perspectives; while engineering students pursue more focused quantitative/analytic coursework with resulting heavy emphasis on left-brain activity and a tendency toward narrower thought patterns.

A third advantage is quite practical: Unlike most other graduate programs, all top MBA programs require at least several years of significant work experience for admission consideration. The quality of this interim work experience and career progress are typically critical factors in acceptance decisions. Because M&T graduates receive numerous attractive employment offers in a broad range of industries, they often have the greatest possible opportunities for meaningful work experience before applying for graduate business studies. This, combined with the integrative nature of their dual-degree undergraduate program, generally places M&T graduates in an advantageous position relative to their peers.

#### What types of careers do M&T graduates pursue?

The Jerome Fisher M&T program is a great choice for those interested in careers in business and careers in engineering. It is also one of the best degrees for entrepreneurs. Many graduates pursue careers in fintech, and the entrepreneurial spirit that pervades our program has inspired our alums to found companies like Stubhub, Flixter, and Willowtree.

#### How long does it take to complete the Jerome Fisher Program in M&T?

The majority of M&T students complete the program in four years. However, the program duration may vary from student to student due to Advanced Placement and prior college credits. The number of classes a student chooses to take each semester or during the summer can also affect the length of the program, as can a particular student’s individualized curriculum. The majority of M&T students take five to six courses per term, whereas the majority of students enrolled in other programs at Penn may take only four to five courses per term.

#### What would I be studying as a student in the Jerome Fisher Program in M&T?

The Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology is a highly individualized program that is tailored to match each student’s interests. M&T students select from wide-ranging undergraduate and graduate courses offered by the School of Arts and Science, the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/), and [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/). This extensive array of class offerings at the University of Pennsylvania, along with independent study and research opportunities, provides considerable flexibility in meeting the established requirements for the two degrees.

#### With so many choices and opportunities available, where can I go for advice?

M&T students rely on three primary advising resources. Both [Wharton](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) and [Penn Engineering](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) offer advisors or faculty to assist with curriculum planning and provide guidance for internship/career choices. Additionally, the Program maintains an advising staff located in the Program office that is able to help and offer guidance. Because the M&T program is limited to only 50-55 students each year, the Program’s students, faculty and staff form a close community that is well-suited to address our students’ individual needs.

#### Do M&T students take classes separately from other Engineering and Wharton students?

Our students take two ‘M&T only’ courses together during their career at Penn.

OIDD 399, Freshman seminar is a required seminar based class for all entering Freshman in the fall quarter. The objective is to help the students understand the intersection of management and technology and how it is being translated in practice. It is designed to lay the foundation for an integrated productive learning program at Penn as Freshman adjust to their new educational environment.

MGMT 237, Management of Technology. MGMT 237 examines the innovative process within technology-based organizations and the range of internal and external forces which impact technological innovation and growth. MGMT 237 is taken during the second semester of sophomore year and is only offered to students enrolled in the M&T Program. Other courses taken by M&T students are selected from offerings in [Penn Engineering](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/), [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), and the School of Arts and Science.

#### Will I have time for other activities while pursuing two degrees?

Yes! The program attracts students who are leaders in their schools and communities. They are, by nature, “doers.” At Penn, M&T students have generally been involved in a wide variety of extracurricular activities, including athletics, clubs and service organizations, and fraternities and sororities. Most are also involved in the M&T Student Board, a professional/social organization which focuses specifically on the interests of M&T students. [**Click here**](http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/inside/student-activities) to read more about the diverse on-campus activities at Penn.

#### Is it possible to pursue a dual Wharton concentration?

Yes! To obtain a dual concentration, you will have to fulfill the requirements of both concentrations. (Visit the Wharton Undergraduate Office for more details.) One of the courses in your secondary concentration may be counted towards the Business Breadth requirement.

#### Do I have time to study abroad?

Yes! Study abroad is strongly encouraged, but it takes some curricular planning on your part. As soon as possible, you should meet with an advisor in the Office of International Programs (International House, 3701 Chestnut Street, Suite 1W) and in the Wharton Undergraduate Division Office (Huntsman Hall, Suite G-95) and the Penn Engineering Office of Academic Programs (Towne Hall, Rm. 111). You will need to coordinate your schedule with both Penn Engineering and Wharton, ensuring that the courses you take abroad can be transferred back to Penn.

#### What is sub-matriculation/accelerated masters and what sub-matriculation options are available to M&T students?

Sub-matriculation/accelerated masters is the opportunity for students with strong academic records to pursue a graduate degree in conjunction with their undergraduate program. Many M&T students have taken advantage of multiple sub-matriculation/accelerated masters options including [Wharton](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/submatriculation/)‘s MBA Program and a number of [Penn Engineering](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/programs-options/submatriculation-engineering/) MS Programs, including the MS in Biotechnology Program. Students who enroll into these graduate programs demonstrate strong academic performance along with the personal and intellectual maturity required to succeed in an advanced degree program.

#### Is there a foreign language requirement?

Yes, proficiency in a foreign language is required for graduation from [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/). Proficiency can be demonstrated in a number of ways: scoring 650 or higher on the Achievement test; scoring between 600 and 640 on this test and then passing an oral exam administered by the pertinent language department; credit from an Advanced Placement test; or by oral exam for native speakers.

Those students not proficient in a foreign language, but who have some foreign language competence, will take a placement exam to identify the appropriate language class. If a student has no experience with a foreign language, four semesters of language study will typically be required to demonstrate proficiency. (Please check with the appropriate language department for specific requirements to demonstrate proficiency.)

#### Does applying to a coordinated dual degree program like M&T hurt my chances for single degree admission to UPenn?

No, applying to a CDD such as M&T does not diminish your chances overall for admission to the University of Pennsylvania. Selecting a single degree choice as a back-up provides you with additional options. Please email the program staff at [**mgtech@seas.upenn.edu**](mailto:mgtech@seas.upenn.edu) if you have additional questions about admissions.
