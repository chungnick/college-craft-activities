The Simons-NYU Science Explorations Program is a summer program that brings together students from a variety of academic backgrounds with a passion for the physical and life sciences.

This free program is for academically motivated students with a demonstrated interest in any/all of the following subjects: biology, chemistry, neural science, physics, and psychology. All eligible students are encouraged to apply.

During the course of this three-week program, students will participate in lectures and labs led by some of the world's leading scientists at New York University, offering a unique opportunity to learn and network directly from some of today's most innovative researchers in the field.

## How to Apply

There is no application fee to apply to this program. Each student is allowed to submit only one application. Please see our program [website](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/science/summer-program/simons-nyu-science-explorations-program.html) for a link to the application.

The application for this program is a multi-step process:

* You will create login credentials by completing and submitting the program application form. This will generate an email with the application login instructions. Once you receive the email, open it and follow the enclosed instructions to create and submit your application;
* To submit this application, you will need to upload your high school transcript (this can be official or unofficial), and at least one (1), but no more than two (2) recommendations. Please do not upload any other documents as they will not be reviewed.
  + If you start the application before you receive your transcript (official or unofficial), you can log back into your account at a later date to upload your transcript when you have it.
  + You can collect a recommendation from a qualified adult by filling out the recommender form, which will send an automated email to your recommender. You can submit your application before your recommender submits their form, and you can also send an automated reminder email to your recommender through the Recommender page of the application. Please note that your recommender will receive an email immediately after their information is submitted or after clicking the “Remind Recommender” button.

To continue an existing application, please log in to the [Applicant Management page](https://connect.nyu.edu/apply/).

You'll receive a confirmation email once your application has been fully submitted, and when your recommender submits their recommendation.

[###### Visit Program Website](https://as.nyu.edu/science/summer-program/simons-nyu-science-explorations-program.html)

I have a preference for a certain subject. Which one will I be studying?

As this program is intended to be an overview of various concepts in the sciences, all students will be participating in all lectures, regardless of subject. Lectures will cover a variety of topics in biology, chemistry, neural science, physics, and psychology, while labs will explore hands on applications in biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, and physics.

What does a typical day look like?

Students get up in the mornings and can either grab breakfast from a dining hall or head straight to the day's lecture at 9 am. After the first lecture, there will be a break, followed by another lecture, before the program lets out for lunch. After lunch, students will head to the first of two labs (of which there will be a break in between), before the program breaks for the night around 4 pm.

At the end of the day's classes, as the program assigns no homework, students are free to grab dinner, hang out, explore the city, and participate in NYU's Summer Events, which has included Broadway shows, visits to the Freedom Towers, and movie screenings, to name just a few.

What kinds of expenses does the program cover?

As previously mentioned, the Simons-NYU Science Explorations program is generously funded by our donor, the Simons Foundation. Thanks to their contribution, all costs incurred during travel--including but not limited to students' air fare, train fare, and cost of gas, to/from campus--are covered. Housing and dining expenses are also covered by the program--all accepted students are eligible to either reserve a room or commute to campus, if desired, and all students regardless of housing decision are enrolled in an NYU dining plan.
