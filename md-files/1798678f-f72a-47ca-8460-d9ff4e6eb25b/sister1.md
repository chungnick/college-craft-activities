# Simons -NYU Science Explorations Program

## About

The Simons-NYU Science Explorations Program is an intensive, three-week residential program for high school students interested in studying biology, chemistry, neural science, physics, and psychology at the introductory college level. This no cost program is designed to give students a taste of college-level coursework and research, with exposure to disciplines central to the life and physical sciences, while also providing opportunities to learn from distinguished NYU faculty and guest speakers.

The program is held on the NYU campus and is open to rising high school juniors, seniors, and recent high school graduates, with a demonstrated interest in any of the following subjects: biology, chemistry, neural science, physics, and psychology. During the course of this three week program, students will have the chance to participate in laboratory research and attend lectures and workshops where they will be exposed to the basic principles of all five of these major disciplines. Students will also take part in social and cultural activities in New York City.
