# Summer Science Research Program

Hofstra University's **Summer Science Research Program** **(HUSSRP)** offers high school students opportunities to conduct on-campus research under the guidance of our faculty in all disciplines including Biology, Chemistry, Psychology, Computer Science, Engineering, Sociology, Geology, Mathematics, and Public Health. HUSSRP is competitive and students must submit a completed online application and letter of recommendation from a teacher by the deadline for their application to be reviewed. Students will be selected for this program based on their performance in their relevant high school classes, a personal interview, the high school teacher's recommendation, and the availability of a faculty mentor.

The program generally runs through the month of July culminating in a poster session where students display the work they performed during the summer. The poster session is open to all students in the program, their families, and their teachers.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Who is eligible for the program?
:   See eligibility requirements above. Only current high school sophomores or juniors are eligible. Please only apply if you meet the listed criteria.

Are there any exceptions to the applicant eligibility?
:   No. Students must be US citizens and/or permanent residents; and must be at least 15 years of age by the start of the program. No exceptions.

How do I apply?
:   All applicants must complete an online application form by the deadline; faxed, mailed or emailed applications are not accepted. Recommendation letters must also be submitted online by the due date. Changes cannot be made to the application after it is submitted.

Can I mail in my application?
:   No. All parts of the application (including recommendation letters) must be submitted through our online application system. If you have issues uploading your application, email your documentation [HUSSRP@HOFSTRA.EDU](mailto:HUSSRP@hofstra.edu).

May I participate in the program for a shorter time?
:   Participants are required to complete four full weeks of the program though some exceptions may be made upon agreement between student and mentor. The expectation is that the student attends the orientation and weekly seminars.

May I submit supplemental materials for my application?
:   No. A completed application comprises: 1) online application, 2) online teacher recommendation. Please do not attempt to send any other supplementary materials (test scores, awards, additional recommendation letters) that are not requested as they will not be included as part of your application.

How will I know that my application is complete?
:   Applicants will receive a notification on their oline portal that their application was successfully submitted. **All applicants will be notified about admissions decisions around the mid-April.**:   There are no early admissions decisions. Applicants who wish to withdraw their application/admissions candidacy should email [HUSSRP@hofstra.edu](mailto:HUSSRP@hofstra.edu). Application fees are non-refundable.

    Who should write recommendation letters for me?
    :   As part of your application, you must have one strong recommendation letter from a teacher, preferably in a subject the student intends to pursue in the summer program. The recommendation should come from someone who can attest to your academic potential, communication skills, laboratory skills, and ability to work independently and with others. Recommendation letters from family or friends will not be accepted. Recommendation letters are to be submitted via the provided online form. Recommenders receive the form after a completed application is submitted by the student.

    Are there any tuition fees?
    :   Yes. Please see the “Application and Program Dates, Deadlines, and Fees” section above.

    Where are you located? Do you provide housing and/or transportation?
    :   All student research will be conducted at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY. The program is currently designed for in-person interactions a few times a week which may be supplemented with some virtual sessions. If you can only participate as a virtual-only applicant, you must select that option on the application.  
          
        Please be aware that we do not provide housing and/or transportation. You will be responsible for your own housing accommodations and transportation. You may, however, be able to access the Hofstra shuttle buses for pick up and drop off at the Hempstead and Mineola LIRR (Long Island Railroad) train stations.

    What are the dates and hours of the program?
    :   The 4-week program runs from the beginning of July to the end of July, generally Monday - Thursday. Students’ hours may vary depending on the mentor’s schedule. All accepted students must attend the orientation session at the start of the program. For students in relevant subjects, there will also be a mandatory lab safety session.  
          
        In addition, students are expected to attend a weekly seminar/lunch on Wednesdays from noon to 1 p.m. Students will then be invited to campus for a late afternoon poster session to present the results of their research.

    Can my research project be used for competition in local national science contests?
    :   On your application, please select if you intend on submitting your work for consideration in a contest. Students must receive permission from their lab mentor before submitting their project externally.

    How many students are accepted to this program?
    :   The number of students accepted depends on faculty availability. Last year, we received over 300 applications and cannot provide individualized feedback to applicants. Because we receive many more applications than we have available spots in the program, we cannot guarantee acceptance, even for highly qualified candidates.

    What happens after I submit my application?
    :   Applications are continuously reviewed and correspondence will not all happen in the same week. Individual faculty members will review subject-relevant applications and will choose select applicants for interviews via Zoom to discuss the student’s specific research project and potential schedules. Any general concerns and questions should be asked at this point before you agree to participate in research. All applicants will be notified of admissions decisions around mid-April.

    If I am accepted, how long will I have to confirm that I will participate in the program?
    :   After you are accepted, you are expected to confirm your participation in the program within seven days of the notification with a deposit due. If you don’t, you will forfeit your spot in the program.

    If admitted, what do I need to complete BEFORE HUSSRP starts?
    :   Once you have been accepted into the program, you are encouraged to reach out to your mentor directly to find out more about potential research projects and for recommendations of papers you might read to get started. You may or may not connect with your research group.

    Is there a dress code?
    :   While there is no formal dress code, participants are expected to dress in comfortable clothing that is appropriate for their lab setting. For certain disciplines, there will be specific guidelines on lab appropriate attire. Failure to wear lab appropriate attire may result in dismissal from the lab as the attire is for safety reasons.

    Will applying or participating in HUSSRP help me get into Hofstra University?
    :   This program is not related to Hofstra Undergraduate Admissions. Participation in this program does not result in admission to a Hofstra University degree program. Hofstra reserves the right to admit as requested, to deny admission, or to offer provisional admission. The program will not provide feedback to applicants if admission is denied.

    Whom should I contact if I, my parents, or teacher have further questions?
    :   Please contact the Program Managers by e-mail at [HUSSRP@hofstra.edu](mailto:HUSSRP@hofstra.edu).
