University students in any year of their degree program are eligible to apply to ENLACE.

### **III. APPLICATION TO SERVE AS CHAPERONE**

University students accepted into the program as chaperones are guaranteed a full scholarship.  In addition to full participation in the program, chaperones will support the program by serving as mentors and tutors for the high school students in the program.  In order to apply to the program as chaperones, interested students must also apply to the ENLACE 2026 program (see Section I above).  We recommend that students interested in participating in ENLACE 2026, also apply for financial support (see Section II above), as the chaperone positions are very limited.

As part of the chaperone application, students will have to provide the following documents in PDF format (no other formats will be accepted):

**1.  Letter of recommendation from university professor:** This letter of recommendation should be from a university professor, and it is in addition to the letter of recommendation submitted as part of the application to ENLACE.  The letter must be a different recommender from the letter submitted for the program application.  The letter should describe academic aptitudes and maturity as a student and as a person.  We want to know that the student is motivated, hard-working, and responsible.  This letter must be two pages in length.  The letter can be in English or Spanish.

**2.  A letter of recommendation from a parent or legal guardian:** This letter of recommendation must be from a parent or legal guardian and must describe the student's capacities as a chaperone (i.e., responsible, of the highest integrity, punctual, capable of serving as a friend and mentor to high school students).  Specific examples of mentoring activities are welcome.  The letter must also confirm that the parent is willing to take responsibility for the actions of the student.  This letter must be two pages in length.  The letter can be in English or Spanish.

**3.  Essay:** This essay needs to describe why the student wants to participate in the program as a chaperone, the student's willingness to engage as a mentor to high school students, and confirm a complete commitment to uphold all program rules and requirements.  This essay should be two pages in length and must be in English.

**4.  Chaperone signature document:** The ENLACE 2026 Signature document for chaperones must have signatures that are handwritten.  The form can be found here:
