# United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad

The **United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad** (**USAJMO**), along with the [USAMO](/wiki/index.php?title=USAMO "USAMO"), are the third exams in the series of exams used to challenge bright students on the path toward choosing the team that represents the United States at the [International Mathematics Olympiad](/wiki/index.php?title=International_Mathematics_Olympiad "International Mathematics Olympiad") (IMO).

About 60 top scorers of the USAJMO and [USAMO](/wiki/index.php?title=USAMO "USAMO") are invited to participate in the [Math Olympiad Summer Program](/wiki/index.php?title=Math_Olympiad_Summer_Program "Math Olympiad Summer Program") (MOP), a challenging 3 to 4 week math program for the brightest students in the country.

The USAJMO is administered by the [Mathematical Association of America](/wiki/index.php?title=Mathematical_Association_of_America "Mathematical Association of America") (MAA). [Art of Problem Solving](/wiki/index.php?title=Art_of_Problem_Solving "Art of Problem Solving") (AoPS) is a proud sponsor of the MAA.

* [4 See also](#See_also)

## Format

The USAJMO is a proof-based examination taken by approximately 250 of the highest scoring students in the [AMC 10](/wiki/index.php?title=AMC_10 "AMC 10") and [AIME](/wiki/index.php?title=AIME "AIME") exams. The competition takes place over 2 consecutive days. Each day, 3 problems are given to the students to work for 4.5 hours. Responses are assessed based on correctness, completeness, and clarity and are subsequently awarded between 0 and 7 points, making the maximum score 42. Since most students receive limited exposure to proofs in high school, scores in the single digits are common.

## Curriculum

The USAJMO is best approached by students with a solid command of topics in [algebra](/wiki/index.php?title=Algebra "Algebra"), [geometry](/wiki/index.php?title=Geometry "Geometry"), [number theory](/wiki/index.php?title=Number_theory "Number theory"), and [combinatorics](/wiki/index.php?title=Combinatorics "Combinatorics") and a host of rigorous methods such as [induction](/wiki/index.php?title=Induction "Induction") and [proof by contradiction](/wiki/index.php?title=Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction"). Students who do well on the USAJMO have considerable experience in both solving highly challenging problems and [writing proofs](/wiki/index.php?title=Writing_proofs "Writing proofs"). Following the general format of high school competitions, the USAJMO does not require [calculus](/wiki/index.php?title=Calculus "Calculus") or related topics, though proofs using higher mathematics are accepted.
