#### **Founded in 1950, the AMC is the preeminent math competition for students K-12. Today, over 300,000 students in 50 states and over 30 countries take the AMC to bolster their confidence and passion for math.**

## Empowering the Next Generation of Problem Solvers

The AMC program is more than just a competition; it’s a national effort to strengthen the mathematical capabilities of our next generation of innovators. By challenging students with engaging problems, the AMC sets the stage for lifelong mathematical exploration, discovery, and achievement.

## This Year's Competitions

**The 2025-26 MAA AMC dates are:**  
AMC 10 A and AMC 12 A –  November 05, 2025  
AMC 10 B and AMC 12 B –  November 13, 2025  
AMC 8 – January 22 to 28, 2026

## Who can participate in the MAA AMC?

The MAA AMC proudly engages with a dedicated group of participants, each crucial to the success of our mathematical community:

* Students: Calling all middle and high school students looking to engage in an exciting problem-solving experience! Challenge yourself and improve your mathematical abilities by taking the AMC 8, the AMC 10, and/or the AMC 12, depending on your grade level.
* Educators: We seek teachers at accredited middle/high schools, colleges/universities, math circles, and learning centers to serve as competition managers, administering the AMC 8, AMC 10, and AMC 12 to interested students. A competition manager enrolls students, proctors the AMC on the competition date(s), and shares scores and awards with participants after the competition.

[Full Eligibility Requirements for Students and Educators](https://maa.org/student-programs/amc/maa-american-mathematics-competitions-policies/)

### **How do I get involved?**

**For those living in the United States and Canada:**   
  
Students/Parents: Ask your school if they will be hosting the AMC 8 or AMC 10/AMC 12. If they are unable to do so, check at local colleges and universities, math circles, or learning centers. You can consult [this list of higher learning institutions and learning centers](https://maa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-2025-Higher-Learning-and-Learning-Center-MAA-AMC-Sites.pdf) that registered last year as a starting point. Students and parents do not register directly with the MAA.

Educators: [Register](https://maa.org/amcreg/) your accredited middle/high school, university, math circle, or learning center and pay the fees by the [deadline](https://maa.org/amcreg/) for each competition cycle.

### **What are the different MAA AMC competitions?**

### **AMC 8**

The AMC 8 is a great way to introduce younger students to mathematical problem-solving beyond the standard school curriculum. Students who enjoy the AMC 8 may want to continue with the AMC 10 and AMC 12 in later years.

**Description:** The AMC 8 is a 25-question, 40-minute competition designed for students in grade 8 and below. The competition focuses on middle school mathematics topics, including counting and probability, estimation, proportional reasoning, elementary geometry (including the Pythagorean Theorem), spatial visualization, and interpreting graphs and tables. Some of the later questions may touch on beginning algebra topics, such as linear or quadratic functions and coordinate geometry.  
  
**For:** Middle school students in grades 8 and below, with a maximum age of under 15.5 years on the day of the competition.   
  
**When**: Annually in January over the course of a week. Students may only take the AMC 8 once each year.

### **AMC 10**

The AMC 10 provides students with an opportunity to develop their problem-solving skills. It serves as the [first step in qualifying for the USA team in prestigious international mathematics competitions](https://maa.org/maa-invitational-competitions/), including the International Mathematical Olympiad.

**Description:** The AMC 10 is a 25-question, 75-minute multiple-choice competition designed for students in grades 10 and below. The content covers mathematical topics such as elementary algebra, basic geometry, area and volume formulas, elementary number theory, and elementary probability. Advanced topics like trigonometry, advanced algebra, and advanced geometry are excluded.

The AMC 10 offers two versions of the test, the 'A' and 'B' competitions. Competition managers can choose the date that best fits their schedule or have their students participate in both.  
  
**For:** High school students in grades 10 and below, with a maximum age of under 17.5 years on the day of the competition.

**When:** Annually in November on the same dates as AMC 12. Students may not take both AMC 10 and AMC 12 on the same day.

### **AMC 12**

The AMC 12 helps students develop their problem-solving abilities and serves as the [first step in qualifying for the USA team in prestigious international mathematics competitions](https://maa.org/maa-invitational-competitions/), including the International Mathematical Olympiad.

**Description:**The AMC 12 is a 25-question, 75-minute multiple-choice competition designed for students in grades 12 and below. It covers the full high school mathematics curriculum, including trigonometry, advanced algebra, and advanced geometry. Calculus is excluded.

The AMC 12 offers two versions of the test, the 'A' and 'B' competitions. Competition managers can choose the date that best fits their schedule or have their students participate in both.

**For:** High school students in grades 12 and below, with a maximum age of under 19.5 years on the day of the competition.  
  
**When:** Annually in November on the same dates as AMC 10. Students may not take both AMC 10 and AMC 12 on the same day.

## Safeguarding the Integrity of the Competitions

**Increased Security for Competition Distribution:** We continue to upgrade competition distribution procedures to enhance digital security, including adding features to prevent unauthorized access and shortening release windows to minimize leaks.

**Additional Reviewing and Vetting of Test Sites and Managers:** We continue to improve our vetting procedures to ensure that all new competition sites and competition managers undergo rigorous checks.

**Continuing Community Engagement:**We encourage the community to report any threats to exam integrity through a dedicated email address, [amcintegrity@maa.org](mailto:amcintegrity@maa.org), with staff assigned to follow up on these concerns.

### **Why take the MAA AMC?**

Hear from some of our students and teachers about why they value the MAA AMC:

“I brought AMC to my school for the first time last year and I saw students in awe of the world of mathematics. I also saw a lot of students who did not believe in themselves at first, and came out of the competition feeling way more confident and interested in pursuing mathematics in their future.

It is important to me that my students feel unafraid to challenge themselves and the AMC is an amazing way to foster opportunities of critical thinking at my school.”

Movina Seepersaud

East-West School of International Studies, Flushing, NY

“I became interested in participating in the AMCs because I was looking to pursue mathematics beyond the standard curriculum. I found the problems really different and way more interesting than the math I was used to in school.”

Sargam M.

AMC 12 A Participant

“Where I come from, not many people are interested in math or math competitions, so I saw the AMC as a chance to connect with others who love math as much as I do. It’s not just about taking the test; the entire preparation process…exposed me to many wonderful people and their unique ways of thinking.”

Summer L.

AMC 10 A Participant
