# Assured Admissions Requirements

Please note that the application process is completed by the UH Admissions Department to determine if applicants are admissible under UH Admissions requirements as well as C. T. Bauer College of Business' Admissions requirements which are higher than UH general requirements.

### Application Process to UH and Bauer College

#### *We've Gone Test Optional*

Applicants have the option to apply for admission with or without a test score for the following fall academic term. Applicants are not disadvantaged by applying without a test score.

##### 1. Apply Online

Complete the University of Houston application for admission using [The Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/). Submit just one application.

On your application, you will select whether you want your application to be reviewed with a test score or without a test score. Be sure to complete the short admissions essay and tell us about your extracurricular activities.

##### 2. Application Fees

Pay the nonrefundable $75 application fee ($90 for international students) with a credit card or debit card. Payment can be made in your [myUH self-service portal](https://accessuh.uh.edu/) or before submitting the admissions application.

First-time freshmen may qualify for an application fee waiver. Simply complete the National Association for College Admissions Counseling [Fee Waiver Form](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/in-person-ncf-fee-waiver-application-fall-2023.pdf) and submit a PDF copy through your [myUH account](https://accessuh.uh.edu/).

##### 3. Submit Your Transcript

Pick one of the following options to submit your most recent high school transcript information:

* Ask your school administrator to send your official transcript data electronically through an EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) system, e.g. TREx (for Texas institutions) or
* Self-report your transcript information. Visit your task list in your [my.uh.edu self-service portal](https://saprd.my.uh.edu/psp/saprd/?cmd=login&languageCd=ENG&) to self-report your transcript information. You'll only report your math, science, English, and social studies classes.
