# Providing the tools to help tomorrow’s leaders succeed

## Since 2004, Student Leaders® has been part of our ongoing commitment to youth employment and economic mobility. We’re helping prepare a pipeline of community-minded young students to be successful in the workforce through leadership training and work experience.

By driving responsible growth, we deliver for clients and address pressing societal issues, including advancing employment opportunities for youth and young adults. Through our Student Leaders® program, we annually connect more than 300 community-minded high school juniors and seniors from nearly 100 communities to employment, skills development and service.

The students hail from many backgrounds, but are united by their drive and commitment. Through paid internships with local nonprofits and participation in a national leadership summit, they gain practical work and life experience.

If you or someone you know have a passion for improving the community, see where the Student Leaders program operates and [learn more about our eligibility criteria](https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/student-leader-eligibility-criteria).

### Transcript

## Opportunity to serve, inspire, change

Every year, hundreds of community-minded high schoolers are accepted into the Student Leaders program. They get first-hand experience in serving their communities through a paid eight-week internship with nonprofits like Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Habitat for Humanity.

They also get to see how nonprofits, governments and businesses collaborate to meet local needs by participating in the national Student Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. Many of the students use their new-found skills to create more change and improve more lives, with inspiring stories of enthusiasm and commitment.
