REACH (Research Experiences in Astronomy at [CIERA](http://ciera.northwestern.edu/) for High School Students) is a highly interactive program that provides high school students experience with astronomy research in an atmosphere of team-style learning, hands-on training, and mentorship from professional scientists. Sessions consist of a 3-week Core program followed by REACH Further, a limited-availability, 3-week extended research project with a mentor.

Students enrolled in the program engage in astronomy research projects with CIERA astronomers. Aligned with the requirements of modern astrophysics research, the Core program is focused on intensive training in the Python programming language and astro-related packages, similar to a coding bootcamp. Students also practice necessary research skills and gain a background in a variety of astronomy topics. Participants will also participate in extracurriculars such as a college/career panel, solar observing at Dearborn Observatory, and social games. Students then apply their programming skills to complete one or more mini projects built upon research actively being done at CIERA.

**REACH is an introductory program.** **No prior experience with computer programming or astronomy is needed, nor is it assumed.** 

Students accepted into REACH Further dive deeper into an independent research project under the supervision of a CIERA mentor. Completion of the Core program is necessary to attend REACH Further.

For more in-depth information, check out this year’s Program page or our FAQ.

**The REACH program is dedicated to engaging students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and so we particularly encourage such students to [apply](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cierahs/apply/)!**

**Full or partial tuition assistance is available thanks to The Brinson Foundation and additional supporters of CIERA.**

## Testimonials

REACH was a defining factor in my decision to pursue physics and astrophysics, and it gave me a head-start in my further research and education experience. Not only did the astronomy research project give me insight into what I am interested in academically, but the experience with learning Python gave me a huge advantage in my further lab work. REACH made my transition to college courses and lab work much smoother.

2019 REACH Student

REACH had something to offer for everyone despite their skill level and is one of the most enriching experiences I have had in my high school career.

2023 REACH Student

“Through REACH, I was able to get some insight in the field of astronomy which was very impactful because my school does not provide many resources or opportunities in astronomy to explore. My school is very focused on STEM, but more specifically technology and computer science of STEM. I had so much fun at REACH, every moment of it. I loved how quickly everyone bonded, getting to meet many different people, and seeing how passionate they were about astronomy. To be honest, at the beginning of the program I felt a bit left out as I didn’t know much about astronomy as others, but throughout the program I felt more comfortable, learning new things and sparking an interest in exoplanets. Right after the program ended, I took a college course in computer programming and guess what language we worked with? PYTHON! REACH taught me the capabilities I wasn’t aware I held, and to be confident in them.”

2024 REACH Student

“I wanted to say how great and important the REACH experience was for me, especially as a foreigner doing scientific research in a different language and with people whose culture is completely different from mine and just getting to know more of the possibilities related to the astronomy side and gaining knowledge on that was essential. It was surely a challenge but I don’t regret it a second and that’s because you allowed me such a position, so thank you for the opportunity and support which I will remember for a long time.”
