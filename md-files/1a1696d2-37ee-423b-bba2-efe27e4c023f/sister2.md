# FAQs

### Answers to our most frequently asked questions

##### How many students attend the REACH program?

REACH has grown nearly every year. 51 students attended in 2024 and 2025 over both Core sessions. In 2026, we also expect ~50 students.  
The number of spots available for REACH Further is dependent on the number of mentors available. We hope to recruit 12-18 mentors each year.

##### Who is eligible to attend the REACH program?

High school students who are in grades 10-12 at the time of application are welcome to apply. The vast majority of REACH students apply in grades 10 and 11 as they wrap up their sophomore and junior years.

Students outside of Evanston/Chicago and international students are still welcome to apply, but see our FAQ on Housing.

See our Apply page for details on how to apply and what is required.

##### Who attends the REACH Program? (Stats and Demographics)

Ranges based on 2023-25 students (41-51 students per year)

* **~50-60%** of students identified as an underrepresented gender in STEM
* **~20-25%** of students identified as an underrepresented minority in STEM
* **33-45%** requested financial assistance
* **>90%** applied as a sophomore or junior (grades 10-11)
* **50-68%** were local to the Chicago/Evanston area
* **~3-4** students per year were international
* **12-15** students attend REACH Further per year

##### When will application results be sent out?

Mid- to late-April, depending on the number of applicants.

##### Are there any prerequisites for attending?

No background in coding or astronomy is required. A firm grasp in algebra would be helpful.

##### How much financial assistance is available?

REACH can offer partial or full tuition waivers to accepted students. In recent years, 100% of admitted students who applied for aid received at least partial assistance with many receiving full tuition waivers. Most of those funds coming from The Brinson Foundation.

Funding per year can vary, but we aim to lessen the financial burden as much as possible. Write to us if you have concerns.

Financial assistance cannot exceed tuition cost.

##### Does REACH accept INTERNATIONAL students?

Yes, but only a limited number of spots are available to international students. Previous international students have attended from countries such as Spain, Rwanda, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Canada, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, India.

Important notes for international applicants:

* REACH does **not** **provide** **housing** or food to students. See the FAQ Housing answer below for more information.
* If you require a visa, previous students have submitted a **B2 Visitor visa**. We can provide a letter of invitation to aid you in your application.
* Some countries have a very long and/or complicated visa process, so be sure to check the timeline of the visa process in your country.
* Internationals are still eligible for tuition waivers.

International students are defined as non-US citizens attending school outside of US territory.   
US citizens and residents of territories such as Puerto Rico should apply as a Domestic applicant, and note the information on your application.  
If you are not a US citizen, but attend high school within the US, apply as Domestic.

As you consider joining our summer program in the United States, we want to acknowledge that the current political climate can seem uncertain and poses higher risk to international students. Policies affecting travel, visas, and international visitors may change quickly, and we understand this can raise concerns.

Your safety and well-being are our top priorities. We strongly encourage you to have discussions with your parents and explore additional resources such as your school counselors, international education staff, and your country’s embassy or consulate which can provide up-to-date guidance on travel to the US, visa policies, and other important information. While we at CIERA are committed to making your experience enriching and welcoming, you need to carefully consider these factors before making a decision. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with questions. We’ll answer as best we can.

We at CIERA are actively working on ways CIERA can continue to engage with the global community in a safe environment for our students, and will announce opportunities as they become available.

##### Does REACH provide HOUSING or food?

REACH is a daytime-only program. **We are unable to provide housing to REACH students at this time.**

We are open to admitting students from outside the Evanston/Chicago area, but housing is a big barrier for students who are not local. About 30-50% of students come from out of the area. We have explored options on campus, but unfortunately, we are not able to offer on-campus housing.

Some students attending from outside of Evanston have family or friends in the area. Some have stayed in AirBnBs, or sublet an apartment for part of the summer. We can share a couple resources once admitted. If we are lucky, a local REACH family may offer to host an out-of-state student at their house for the duration of the program. We may be able to connect you to other students looking to share housing costs, or a local family who could host you, but REACH/Northwestern does not take any responsibility in that agreement.

There are a couple events during the REACH program where we will provide food, but meals are largely the responsibility of the student. Students may pack a lunch or visit one of the many take-out restaurants during the lunch hour. Students are unsupervised during the lunch hour.

##### What are students' favorite parts of the REACH program?

* Astro 101 presentations and activities
* Meeting new friends with similar interests
* Learning about the researchers
* Applying new coding skills in the mini-projects
* Interactive activities
* Solar viewing at Dearborn Observatory

> “Please never forget the impact that this work can have on our lives beyond just three weeks. This has had an incredible impact on me, and I could not have imagined this opportunity coming to me.”
>
> “Thank you so much for such a wonderful, fun three weeks that I will constantly think about and cherish forever!! Never stop doing this program and giving new students the opportunity to be a part of something that’s so amazing and fantastic!!”
>
> “This was amazing! I didn’t know much about astrophysics when I started, but hoped to dip my toes into the world of research — and I ended up loving both astro and research!!”

##### Can high school students participate in research at CIERA outside of REACH?

Generally, only REACH alumni are eligible to join a research team at CIERA, **pending availability**. REACH gives students the foundation in programming and research skills needed to join a CIERA research team. If this is something you are interested in pursuing, we would recommend applying to REACH Further.

##### Where should Letters of Rec and Unofficial Transcripts be sent?

Unofficial Transcripts can be uploaded with your application.  
Letters of Recommendation can be sent to ciera-hsprogram@northwestern.edu

##### What other summer camps exist at Northwestern and the nearby community?

See the NU curated list [here](https://hr.northwestern.edu/benefits/caregiving/finding-childcare/summer-camps.html).
