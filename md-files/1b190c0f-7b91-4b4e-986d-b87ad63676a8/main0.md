# Design

### Discover the investigation, innovation, and impact of Design.

## **Program Overview**

Design has never been in greater demand than it is now. Businesses, government, and local communities are turning to designers for innovation and problem-solving, creating new roles for designers in every sector of the marketplace.

Pre-College Design introduces students to the discipline of design, provides a foundation of skills, and gives a clear idea of what to expect from a college-level accredited program. Pre-College Design students will have the opportunity to attend classes taught by full-time Carnegie Mellon faculty where they are given an introduction to the design principles and practices that are the cornerstones of the undergraduate [School of Design](https://design.cmu.edu/about-our-programs/pre-college) program.

Modeled after the first-year college experience, sessions will consist of studio learning, lectures, and critiques, as well as guided work sessions with faculty. Students will be assigned their own personal studio space, providing them with their first foray into “studio life.” By the end of the program, participants will have portfolio pieces that have been critiqued by the School of Design faculty. There will also be a showcase that will feature all the work students have completed during the program, for fellow classmates, faculty, and parents to see.

## Curriculum

## Studio Design for Products, Communications, & Environments

Studio courses allow students to experience the iterative process designers use when developing their best solutions. Teachers guide students through the problem-solving process, introducing basic tools (i.e., sketching, diagramming, prototyping) along the way.

## Design Drawing

Design Drawing is a different way of drawing than fine art drawing. It is one of the ways designers work through their ideas and effectively share their thinking with others. Through guided exercises, students are introduced to ways in which they can make their drawings a stronger communication tool, as well as a useful part of the problem-solving process.

## Design Photography

In addition to the mechanics of using a camera, Design Photography teaches students how to effectively capture images that convey meaning and tell a story.

## Design Research & Problem-Solving Methods

Design Research & Problem-Solving Methods will serve as an introduction to the way designers gather meaningful data and to the tools required to apply that data to their design solutions.
