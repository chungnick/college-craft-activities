## Program Description

The Pediatrics Internship Program at Stanford (PIPS) is a 7-week program in which rising junior and senior high school students from diverse backgrounds learn about science, medicine, and research with Stanford faculty, postdoctoral fellows, students, and researchers by completing a research project. *The PIPS program is designed as an introductory experience for students with little to no prior exposure to research.*

The goals of PIPS are to:

* Increase student interest in maternal and child health research and Pediatrics
* Teach students how scientific research is performed and allow them to conduct research projects
* Better prepare students from a wide range of backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine and the sciences

Applicants from all backgrounds are welcome to apply.

## Stanford's Land Acknowledgment

Stanford sits on the ancestral land of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. This land is of great importance to the Ohlone people, and has been since time immemorial. Consistent with our values of community and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge, honor and make visible the university’s relationship to Native peoples.

This acknowledgment has been developed in collaboration with the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe.

[Learn more about the Stanford's Land Acknowledge Statement](https://www.stanford.edu/native-peoples-relationship/)

A video of Native students Jade Araujo, ’24, and Ryan Duncan, ’24, delivering Stanford’s land acknowledgment can be downloaded and used by members of the Stanford community.
