# Frequently Asked Questions

**When is your application deadline?**

The AMCAS application deadline for the Fall 2026 application cycle is October 15, 2025, and the secondary application deadline is December 1, 2025. Earlier submissions are encouraged to allow time for full consideration of your application.

**I submitted my application several weeks ago, but I have not received a confirmation email or a secondary application. Does this mean that I am no longer being considered?**

Not necessarily. The School of Medicine Office of Admissions does not send confirmation emails when they receive the AMCAS applications. All applications must go through a screening process before a decision is made to grant secondary applications. It may take between 8-12 weeks before you will hear back from the School of Medicine.

**How do I submit an update to the Admissions Committee?**

There are two (2) times when you may submit updates directly to the MSTP administrator: 1) as part of your secondary application and 2) after being interviewed but before the Admissions Committee meeting. These are the only times updates are accepted.

**Can I apply to both the Medical School and MSTP at the same time?**

Yes. In order to be considered for both the Medical School and MSTP separately, you must indicate both programs (MD/MSTP) on the UCSF MSTP secondary application. If you do not check the box for MD/MSTP and you are not accepted into the MSTP program, you will not be considered for the Medical School. At the same time, if you mark both programs, you may receive an offer from the Medical School before you hear from MSTP as they make admission decisions on a rolling basis. This does not mean that you are not being considered for MSTP. MSTP admission decisions are made in early March after we have completed our application reviews and interviews.

**If I don’t get accepted into the MSTP, will I still be considered for the Medical School?**

You may still be under consideration for the School of Medicine, but only if you indicated on your application that you want to be considered for medical school and the MSTP separately. If you only checked the MSTP on your application, then the School of Medicine won’t be considering your application if you aren’t accepted into the MSTP.

**Are international students eligible to apply to the MSTP?**

Unfortunately, no. Our program is funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). This funding is available only to US citizens and lawful US permanent residents. We are therefore unable to admit international students.

**Are applicants with foreign degrees considered for admission into the program? Are there additional requirements for applicants with foreign degrees?**

UCSF accepts coursework and degrees from accredited institutions and the foreign equivalent. Graduates of foreign institutions are required to complete one year of full-time study at an accredited U.S. institution. Prerequisites are set by the School of Medicine, please [refer to their page](https://meded.ucsf.edu/prospective-students/md-program-admissions/md-program-application-process) for more details.

**If I am not accepted into the MSTP but am accepted into the regular MD program, can I re-apply to MSTP?**

Yes, you can re-apply to the MSTP during your first year of medical school. Please contact the MSTP in early fall of MS1 for more details. Internal applications are due December 1st.

**Can I apply to one of the graduate programs at the same time I am applying to the MSTP?**

No, you cannot apply to the MSTP and the Graduate School during the same application cycle.

**The AMCAS Application instructs the applicants to submit 3-5 letters of recommendation. As an MSTP applicant, can I submit more?**

Yes, MSTP applicants can submit between 5-7 letters of recommendation.

**Are MSTP applicants required to submit GRE/GMAT scores in addition to MCAT scores?**

No, MSTP applicants only need to submit their MCAT scores.

**When are MSTP admission decisions made?**

The final MSTP admission decisions are made by early March.

**Does California residency affect MSTP admissions?**

No, residency is not a factor in the decision-making process.

**What type of funding does the program offer?**

The MSTP provides financial support to cover all medical and graduate tuition and fees, along with a yearly stipend of $50,203 (students begin with this stipend and it increases to $52,211 on October 1, 2024 for the remainder of the academic year). Fees include student health - medical, dental, vision, and prescription insurance.

## Student Perspectives

One of the reasons I came to UCSF, a public school, is that the role of this program is to create health care professionals who care about this world. The point of research is to improve the lives of patients in the future, and I see that as part of my responsibility.
