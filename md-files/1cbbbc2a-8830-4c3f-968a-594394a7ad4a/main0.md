# PULSE Program

4. [PULSE Program](/about/diversity/pulse)

PULSE is a semester-long educational outreach program for high school students (grades 9-12) who are passionate about healthcare and biomedical sciences. It was established in 2008, becoming an official pathway program run by the College of Medicine in 2018 with involvement from the medical student interest group by the same name.

The PULSE program aims to cultivate interest in medicine, biomedical science and health care systems science by introducing passionate learners to medical students, biomedical researchers and practicing clinicians.

Any student interested in science/medicine who will be in grades 9-12 at the start of the program can apply to PULSE.

* Students in 8th grade when the application opens may apply because they will be in 9th grade when the program begins, but students who are seniors in high school when the application opens cannot apply because they will have graduated when the program begins.

#### Mission

* To supplement student science education with a quality, 12-week longitudinal curriculum
* To foster the interests of high school students from surrounding communities through interactive lectures, problem-based learning sessions and clinical shadowing opportunities.
* To enrich high school students’ current approaches in acquiring knowledge in scientific endeavors.
* To enhance critical thinking skills and foster independence.
* To provide important information for educational options and career paths in health care.
* To provide mentorship opportunities for participants and medical students.

#### College of Medicine students

The PULSE student organization remains active throughout the year and encourages involvement of medical, PA, nursing and graduate students. Penn State College of Medicine students who would like to learn more about the organization or get involved, should contact PULSE leaders.

## General information

### About the Program

Current medical student volunteers provide an interactive learning experience exploring various topics in medicine. Learn key anatomy, understand common disorders and discover how these vital systems work. The live virtual sessions are held Monday evenings, September through December, typically from 6-7 p.m. There may also be optional in-person opportunities offered by the College of Medicine. Space is limited and instructions for PULSE participants to sign up are provided ahead of the event.

#### Program Details

* Virtual experience with in-person opportunity (limited transportation assistance may be available from designated pick-up points around Harrisburg.)
* Live Zoom sessions focus on interactive discussions about the lecture material, including problem-based learning activities
* Mentorship is incorporated into each Zoom session

#### Structure

* Recorded lectures are sent out ahead of the scheduled session – participants are expected to watch the video **prior** to the Monday sessions
* Interactive discussion about the lecture material
* Problem-based learning session
* Longitudinal mentorship session

**Typical activities include:**

* Small group learning opportunities
* Discussions about college and career preparation:

  + College selection process, SAT/ACT and essay tips, science major information, etc.

**Attendance is important.** In order to get the most from this program, students selected for the College of Medicine’s PULSE program will be expected to attend and participate in all weekly sessions. There will be no exceptions allowed for late arrivals or early dismissals for any reason other than illness or emergency.

* Consideration for excused absences will be given in cases of illness, emergency, and other unique circumstances.
* If you are an athlete and your game or practice schedule overlaps with PULSE, then you should discuss this with your coach.
* **Participants will not receive a certificate of attendance if they miss more than three (3) sessions** (regardless whether the absences are excused or unexcused).

#### Location

* Weekly sessions will take place on Zoom
* Optional in-person activities will take place at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pa.

### Application

The PULSE application opens in mid-March and closes in late-April each year. The link will appear here when it is open, so check back in March!

#### Application Evaluation

PULSE is a competitive program. Applications are evaluated based on responses to short essay questions that are provided when the application opens. Any identifying information on the application is removed and short essays are scored by reviewers on a scale of 1 to 10. Points are tallied for each student and the slots are filled in order of total scores. In the event of a tie for the final remaining slots, students who have never participated in PULSE and/or are entering their final two years of high school or are entering their first two years of high school will be prioritized in order for students to have the opportunity to participate. Students who have comparable scores will be placed on a waitlist and may be offered a spot in the event that some accepted students are unable to participate in the program. To allow as many students as possible to participate, students who have participated in two prior PULSE cycles are not eligible for participation.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Will PULSE be held in-person or virtually?**

This year, PULSE is offering the program in a hybrid format. There will be several optional in-person sessions at Penn State College of Medicine. Space for these sessions will be limited, depending on amount of interest in attending. More information on this will be provided when acceptance offers are extended. There may be limited transportation support for students in the Harrisburg area.

**How will my application be evaluated?**

PULSE is a competitive program. Applications will be evaluated on your responses to the short essay questions. Identifying information from the application is removed and short essays are scored by reviewers on a scale of 1 to 10. Points are tallied for each student. If students are tied in score near the acceptance maximum, students who have never participated in PULSE and are entering their final two years of high school will be prioritized over applicants who have previously participated in PULSE or are entering their first two years of high school. There is a waitlist in the event that some accepted students choose not to participate in the program. To allow as many students as possible to participate, students who have participated in two prior PULSE cycles are not eligible for participation.

**When is the deadline to apply to PULSE, and when will I find out if I was accepted?**

The application deadline is typically the end of April, with no exceptions for late submissions. Decisions are made after thorough review of all applications and based on how many students we can accommodate within the small group, mentorship-focused structure of the program. Application decisions are typically sent via email in late May.

### Schedule

PULSE will generally meet on Mondays from 6 to 7 p.m beginning the Monday after Labor Day and ending the second week in December, and 6-7:30 p.m. when there are quiz bowls. There is no class on Indigenous People’s Day (or noted as Columbus Day on many school calendars), or the Monday before Thanksgiving. **Attendance and participation are important – participants should aim to be present for all sessions.**
