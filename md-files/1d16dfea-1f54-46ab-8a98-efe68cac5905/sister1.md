**April 16th and 17th, 2026 | NC State University, Plant Sciences Building**

[**Register now for the spring cohort of Online Reseach Mentoring!**](https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/YouthActivitySignUp?YouthEventID=CALS-NCYI-2026) Spring Cohort begins Tuesday, January 27th at 6:00 p.m. (via Zoom).

All high school youth are invited to join us for the 2026 [North Carolina Youth Institute](https://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm?nodeID=87698&audienceID=1), an exceptional opportunity that ignites a passion for solving global hunger through an engaging exploration of agriculture and food systems. The North Carolina Youth Institute is an educational initiative of the World Food Prize Foundation and is designed to spark emerging leaders in developing innovative solutions for our world’s most pressing grand challenges surrounding feeding a growing population.

**Dr. Norman Borlaug, the world’s greatest scientist and humanitarian hero** developed a hybrid of wheat that critically increased global food production levels and is credited for saving the lives of one billion people. For this accomplishment, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and subsequently founded the World Food Prize to honor those who dedicate their lives to building food resiliency across the world. Dr. Borlaug’s life is a remarkable example of what youth can accomplish through scientific and humanitarian efforts.

The NCYI is hosted by NC State University’s [College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,](https://www.cals.ncsu.edu/) [North Carolina Cooperative Extension’s](https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/) [4-H Youth Development Program](https://nc4h.ces.ncsu.edu/) and the [Department of Crop and Soil Sciences](https://cals.ncsu.edu/crop-and-soil-sciences/) and is a part of the [World Food Prize Foundation’s](https://www.worldfoodprize.org/) [Global Youth Institute](https://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/youth_programs/global_youth_institute/). Youth come to campus in the spring of each year to attend the two-day long institute at NC State University and share a **research paper and poster** they have created among peers and a panel of judges. Hands-on workshops, field trips, keynotes and career development round out the event.

To participate, youth research a global issue and write a three to five page paper under the supervision of a mentor (teacher/parent/Extension agent/NCSU mentor) [using these paper challenge guidelines](http://www.worldfoodprize.org/documents/filelibrary/youth_programs/Global_Challenge_Paper_Instructions_576CF0E9F8429.pdf).

Here are the steps to get started:

**Step 1: Find a mentor:** identify a mentor locally that really believes in you. This could be a teacher at your school, a 4-H club leader, a coach, FFA advisor, or a parent. You can also join our research mentoring cohort. We will put you in a small group of your peers and assign you a graduate student mentor with shared interests. You can have more than one mentor and each one will help keep you on track and motivated to complete the paper.

* **Online Research Mentoring** – sometimes the people in our lives who might serve as a mentor are busy and so after a successful pilot last year, we have opened registration for our NCYI online research mentoring program (fall and spring sessions). Aligned to support your Global Challenge Paper we will pair you with a mentor from NCSU and you will be in a cohort with 2-4 other students to discuss your research questions and ideas. We will meet online (via Zoom) about once a month for 3-4 sessions. [Register through NCSU’s Reporter System by January 20th for the spring mentoring cohort.](http://www.worldfoodprize.org/documents/filelibrary/youth_programs/Global_Challenge_Paper_Instructions_576CF0E9F8429.pdf) Dates are:

  Tuesday, January 27, 6 p.m. Zoom

  Tuesday, February 10,  6 p.m. Zoom

  Tuesday, March 10, 6 p.m. Zoom

  Tuesday, April 7, 6 p.m. Zoom

  Tuesday, April 14, 6 p.m. Zoom

**Step 2:** **Research and write your paper** [(using these guidelines)](http://www.worldfoodprize.org/documents/filelibrary/youth_programs/Global_Challenge_Paper_Instructions_576CF0E9F8429.pdf) **and create a research poster** (template coming soon)**:**

**Step 3:** **[Register for](https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/YouthActivitySignUp?YouthEventID=CALS-NCYI-2026)[the spring online research mentoring by January 20th or](https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/YouthActivitySignUp?YouthEventID=CALS-NCYI-2026)** simply register and you can use your own mentor (parent, teacher, community member, etc). Registration is through NC State’s REPORTER system. First create a “Brickyard” account and then you will be able to register. If you have any questions, please email Liz Driscoll at liz\_driscoll@ncsu.edu.

Spring Research Mentorship Cohort Sessions are: 

* Tuesday, January 27, 6 p.m. Zoom
* Tuesday, February 10,  6 p.m. Zoom
* Tuesday, March 10, 6 p.m. Zoom
* Tuesday, April 7, 6 p.m. Zoom
* Tuesday, April 14, 6 p.m. Zoom

**Step 4: Attend the North Carolina Youth Institute in person** on **April 16th and 17th, 2026** and be part of an amazing in-person experience at North Carolina State University and become a Borlaug Scholar.

If you have any questions or to learn more about the process of this program, contact the North Carolina Youth Institute State Coordinators, Liz Driscoll at liz\_driscoll@ncsu.edu or (919) 886-3424 or Sarah Dinger at scdinge2@ncsu.edu .

**The Global Youth Institute**

The top students at the North Carolina Youth Institute will be competitively selected to represent the State of North Carolina as delegates at the Global Youth Institute, held in Des Moines, Iowa in October of each year. There, they will join 150 other outstanding high school students and teachers from across the United States and around the world for an exciting three-day program to interact with Nobel and World Food Prize Laureates and the more than 1,500 global leaders from 65 countries attending the World Food Prize’s annual international symposium.

For more information on how to participate in the North Carolina Youth Institute, contact the North Carolina State Coordinators, Liz Driscoll at [liz\_driscoll@ncsu.edu](mailto:liz_driscoll@ncsu.edu) or at [(919) 886-3424](tel:9198863424) and Sarah Dinger at [scdinge2@ncsu.edu](mailto:scdinge2@ncsu.edu).

## About Grow For It

The North Carolina 4-H **Grow For It** program provides resources and opportunities to connect youth and educators to issues in agriculture and natural resources in meaningful ways. This initiative is striving to grow a generation of youth interested in investigating plants, insects and soils through experiential projects that fosters curiosity and wonder, inspire critical thinking and problem solving, build a positive science self-concept, connecting kids to good food and nurturing environmental stewards of the land through farm, garden and nature programming. This programming includes camps like the Resource Conservation Workshop or the Horticultural Science Summer Institute and contests like the state fair insect collection, honey bee essay and horticulture identification and judging contest.

Through the infrastructure of the North Carolina Cooperative Extension system, adult leaders are supported through curriculum development, resource materials, and training workshops to build their knowledge, enthusiasm and ability to deliver research-based programs for youth.

Liz Driscoll is the 4-H subject matter specialist that leads the Grow For It program. Liz loves tromping around gardens, woods, swamps and beaches, exploring interesting plants, soils and bugs and sharing their stories. Her favorite activities include grazing in the garden, stalking interesting insects, whispering secrets to snapdragons and building sand castles.

[NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu) and [N.C. A&T State University](http://www.ncat.edu) work in tandem, along with federal, state and local governments, to form a strategic partnership called N.C. Cooperative Extension, which staffs local offices in all 100 counties and with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
