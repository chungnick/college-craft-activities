Through a combination of in-class discussions and exercises, real-life venture case studies and venture simulations developed at the top Universities, this course prepares for you careers and advanced education in business, entrepreneurship, and intelligent innovation with a solid grounding in fundamentals. We learn and immerse ourselves on the topics of business innovation, venture financing, and growth strategy. The simulations help us experience the dynamics of a business venture and the challenges of raising money, leading the organization, and building wealth for the founders and stakeholders.  Examples include companies that went from an idea to market and raised investment from angels and venture investors.  We also review and discuss research papers on the topics of innovation and creativity to understand how the research process works. Students from past cohorts have walked away with an intense and immersive learning experience that provided a headstart to their careers.
