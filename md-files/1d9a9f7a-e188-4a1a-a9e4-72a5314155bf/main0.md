# Summer Art Camp Update

**Dear Studio A Summer Art Camp Community,**

Thank you for your continued support and participation in the Summer Art Camps at Studio A. It has been a privilege to witness your campers explore their creativity, develop their skills, and express themselves through art. We are so grateful to have been part of their artistic journeys.

As we look ahead to Summer 2025, we want to share some updates about our programming. The summer camp program at Stamp is changing and we want you to know we will not host our weekly summer art camps. While we will not be offering our traditional weekly Summer Art Camps, we’re excited to introduce a variety of new opportunities. These include free public artistic education programs and special events designed to inspire creativity in new ways.

Please keep an eye out for information about our programs on [Maryland Day](https://marylandday.umd.edu/) on **Saturday, April 26, 2025**, where we’ll offer engaging art activities for all ages. Additionally, we are launching a summer Saturday workshop series specifically designed for families, which will be available throughout the summer.

If you’re exploring other camp options at the University of Maryland, *Maryland Today* publishes an annual list of camps. You can view[last year's list](https://today.umd.edu/2024-umd-summer-camps) for reference.

It has been a joy to work with your campers over the years, and we are so grateful for the memories we’ve shared. Thank you for your trust and support, and we look forward to continuing to foster creativity through our new programs.

Warm regards,  
The Studio A Team
