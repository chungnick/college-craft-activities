The summer camp scramble is on: You’re making spreadsheets and color-coding options, setting early alarms for registration and deciding just how much screen time you’re OK with if all your best-laid plans fall through.

Luckily, the University of Maryland offers programs for kids of all ages, whether you’ve got a budding young painter or a teen ready to tackle the challenges of AI. Dozens of camps offer opportunities for experience in science labs, to learn teamwork and drills from some of UMD’s most decorated coaches, or to scale new heights at RecWell’s climbing wall.

Many camps are offered annually, so even if your favorite option is full, refer to this list for next year. (Some popular ones, like Terp Quest and Gymkana, open registration early.) All camps are in person unless otherwise noted; some are still finalizing schedules and pricing, so check back for updates.
