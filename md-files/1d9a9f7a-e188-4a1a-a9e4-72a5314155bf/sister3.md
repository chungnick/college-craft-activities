# FAQ

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

### **General**

Where is Studio A?

Studio A is located in the basement of the Adele H. Stamp Student Union at the University of Maryland. Our neighbors include the lower level of the University Bookstore and TerpZone.

Where should I park?

Visitors to Studio A may park in the Union Lane Garage. There are pay stations to purchase parking in increments of 15 minutes, hours, or the whole day. After 4 PM Monday-Friday and anytime on Saturday and Sunday, visitors may park for free in Lot 1, the large surface lot just beyond the Cole Fieldhouse. UMD campus is also accessible by metro on the Green/Yellow lines.

What is Studio A’s refund policy?

The University of Maryland maintains a strict no refund policy for sponsored activities. UNLESS THE ACTIVITY IS CANCELLED there are NO REFUNDS without a medical excuse from a physician. Due to university procedures, refunds may take up to ten weeks to process.

### **Studio A Classes & Registration**

When is registration for classes?

Registration opens online at the following times:

-Fall Registration: First week of August

-Spring Registration: First week of December

Registration remains open until the classes are filled. Ask to be added to our listserv to be the first to find out about registration and class offerings! You can also contact us directly via email at [StudioA@umd.edu](mailto:StudioA@umd.edu) or via phone at (301) 314-ARTS.

How much do classes cost?

Each class requires different materials, facilities, and instructors; therefore there is a range of course fees from $15 to $200 for the semester. Classes are highly discounted compared to similar credited courses and courses in the community.  The cost of classes varies based on an individual’s affiliation with the University.

Why is my student or faculty/staff class rate not showing up in the cart?

Our registration system checks for class price through the registrar's office; first, make sure you logged in and created your Studio A account through the "[Log in via UMD](https://stamp.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2022-07/Studioa_umd_login.PNG)" button, not through an email/password (even if it is a UMD email address). Additionally, if you are not registered for academic classes, or have any holds on your account, the University's registrar's office does not register you as a UMD student.

How long are classes?

Classes at Studio A vary in length but generally run on a six week schedule. Classes meet weekly for 1-3 hours with the exception of University holidays.

What is ceramics open studio?

Ceramics open studio is available for individuals with former ceramics experience who are not currently enrolled in any studio classes. The studio is open to students during any open Studio A hours where there is not a class in session. This studio time allows time for students to experiment and work individually without the oversight of an instructor or the atmosphere of a formal class. Registration includes one 25-lb. bag of clay, use of glazes, and firing.

Can I get credit for Studio A classes?

Studio A does not offer credit for classes. These classes are activities for the community that are meant to promote student involvement through skill development, social networking, creating a balanced lifestyle, and promoting art appreciation.

Will I need to provide my own materials for classes?

In general, Studio A has the materials needed for each of the classes. Any materials specific to the course that the student will have to purchase (e.g. a guitar for Basic Guitar) will be outlined in the course description.

What happens if the university closes due to inclement weather?

Because Studio A is a department of the University, when the University is closed, we are also closed. Classes, workshops, and other events scheduled for that day will be canceled.

My class was canceled. Will there be a make-up class?

Each class is allotted one make-up class per semester. Typically, the make-up class will take place the week following the end of classes. Any additional make-up classes will be up to the discretion of the instructor and Studio A.

How often does Studio A host workshops? Are they free?

Studio A hosts workshops once a month during the Fall and Spring semesters. These workshops are free and open to the public. They are designed to give you a glimpse of the various classes and activities we offer or could offer throughout the year. Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/umdstudioa) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/UMDStudioA) to hear about upcoming events.

Can I take a class during the academic year if I am under 18?

Due to Child Abuse Reporting laws, we are not able to offer our classes during the academic year to children under 18. We encourage children ages 6-12 to check out our summer camps!

### **Studio A Summer Camp**

What is Studio A’s summer camp?

During July, Studio A offers 4 one-week Summer Arts Camp open to children ages 6-12. The camp runs from 9am-3pm, with After Care available from 3-5pm. Each week, campers will participate in three specialty periods designed to provide focused learning in a specialized field through instruction by an active professional. Our specialties range from visual arts, performing arts and music. The specialties change each week so campers may register for more than one session. Campers will be placed in small groups (max 15) during Specialties to ensure that they receive personalized attention.

### **Studio A Event Reservations**

Can I reserve a studio/room for an event?

Yes! Our studio space is available for student groups and departments to use for meetings, workshops, or parties. Check out our [event page](https://stamp.umd.edu/centers/studio/plan_event) for more details.

I need to cancel my event, will I be charged a fee?

For event reservations, cancellations made less than 5 business days in advance of the event will be charged a 1 hour room reservation fee.

I have less attendees than expected, what happens with the leftover supplies?

Once your event is confirmed, we purchase all necessary supplies to ensure a successful experience. As a result, we cannot provide refunds for any leftover items after the event concludes. Instead, any unused supplies will be compiled into DIY kits and made available for your group to take home.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to making your event memorable!
