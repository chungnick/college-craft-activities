# Pre-College Academy

## Pre-College Academy application for Summer 2025 will be live January 2025!

The Pre-College Academy (PCA) is a six-week college preparatory summer program hosted by EAOP at the University of California, Berkeley.  For over 35 years PCA has provided intensive preparation for EAOP students enrolled in partner schools throughout the Bay Area.  PCA prepares students for their academic and professional futures by providing them with the opportunity to share in the University of California's tradition of educational excellence and diversity.  PCA prepares students for success in the following academic year, including preparation for classes that meet the University of California's and California State University's A-G subject requirements.

### **Course Information**

PCA offers students rigorous coursework, college-level expectations, and a chance to join a community of college-bound scholars. Participants in the program take two classes, one in a theme-based writing course and the second course in math (Geometry, Advanced Algebra, Pre-Calculus). Recent writing course titles include: Environmental Justice: Expanding the Nature-Writing Canon; Your Critical and Scholarly Voice: An Exploration of Stories; Writing Across Genres: The Art of Storytelling and the Intersection of Expression; and Exploring Literacy & Writing through Ethnic Studies, Multimedia Pop Culture, & Identity. Students are enrolled in the math level that will be taking in their schools the following fall.
