The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is the most prestigious international physics competition for secondary school students. The main aim of IPhO is to test the highest level of knowledge, critical thinking, problem solving, proper practices of presentation and analysis, and hands-on skills in theoretical and experimental physics. The IPhO is organized annually in different countries as a 9-10 day competition where national teams comprising a maximum of five of their best physics students and two team leaders participate.
