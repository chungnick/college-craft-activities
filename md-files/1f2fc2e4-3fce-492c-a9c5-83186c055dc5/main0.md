### GRIPS Summer 2026

The Genomics Research Internship Program at Stanford (GRIPS) brings summer internship opportunities in genetics  genomics to Bay Area high school students.

GRIPS offers highly talented high school students a unique research experience, professional development, and community building opportunities.

 The summer of 2026 the program will be a hybrid program.  Students will be participating in laboratory activities and group workshops and must be able to come to campus when necessary.

# About the program

|  |
| --- |
| GRIPS is a twenty hour, eight week long research intensive experience for high school students. Program participants will be placed in a research laboratory for the summer and conduct genomics research under the supervision of a lab mentor.  The summer 2026 program will start on June 15 and end on August 6, 2026. Students in GRIPS must commit to participating for the entire duration of the program. This experience will be four hours per day, five days per week, for the entire internship period. The typical schedule is 9am - 1pm,  Monday through Friday.  While the main focus of the program is an immersive research experience, GRIPS students will also be expected to participate in all other program activities such as:    Weekly required sessions with all members of the cohort  Regular check in meetings with your research mentor   Genomics Research Internship Program at Stanford (GRIPS) is run by a small team of researchers who are volunteering their time. We apologize that due to the number of applications, it is not possible for us to respond to every applicant. If you have not heard from us by the due date, it means you were not selected.  There is an application fee of $55, but there is no fee to participate in the GRIPS program. [The application fee can be paid here.](https://cardinalpay.stanford.edu/pay/genetics) If you require a fee waiver please have a guidance counselor or high school teacher contact grips-program@stanford.edu by February 15, 2026. Do I need prior computer science knowledge to applydo we need to know? None.  Prior experience with computer programming is helpful, and may allow you to be more productive in your research. Your level of previous computer programming experience will be used to determine lab placement and appropriate projects. The most common languages used by genetics/genomics laboratories are Python, R, and Java. Prior experience in one of these languages is helpful, though not required. Do I need prior internship or lab experience to apply? No.  We strongly encourage students who have not had previous research experiences to apply. While prior experience may allow some participants to be more productive in their research, GRIPS is meant to be an entry-level program that introduces high school students to biomedical research. |
