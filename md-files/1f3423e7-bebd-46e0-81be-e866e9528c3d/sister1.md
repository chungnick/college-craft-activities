# 2026 Computational Biology Hybrid Camp

This camp is for students interested in math, science, medicine, and computation. The camp will focus on the role of genome and transcriptome in diseases and symptoms and guide students in performing computational biology research using patient RNA expression data to identify RNA biomarkers related to certain diseases. If you have not taken first-year high school biology, we expect you to study the basic transcription and translation process using materials that we provide before the camp.

The miRcore volunteer program research is based on the CB camp materials, so taking this camp is one of requirements if you want to become a miRcore volunteer and lead or otherwise participate in a school club GIDAS (Genes in Diseases and Symptoms).

On day 1, each small group will determine a disease of focus for which they will work to identify either novel diagnostics or treatment options. Their research tools will be those currently used by scientists. This approach is different from conventional high school education as there are no right answers, only uncertain but logical exploration towards new findings.

| CB Camps | Date | Time | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session 1 | June 15 – June 19, 2026 | 10 am – 5 pm (Eastern Time) | University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI or Online |
| Session 2 | July 6 – July 10, 2026 | 10 am – 5 pm (Eastern Time) | University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI or Online |
| Session 3 | July 27 –  July 31, 2026 | 9 am – 4 pm (Pacific Time) | Scripps Research Translational Institute, La Jolla, CA or Online |

In-person camps include a wet-lab experimental day or field-trip day. Virtual students will have a separate program from in-person students during those days.

**For more computationally-intensive research**, we offer [**Biotechnology Sequencing Camp**](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-bts-camp/) (Linux shell script) and [**Advanced Computational Biology Research Camp**](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-acb-camp/).

## All campers learn to understand these types of graphs and use them for disease research

## Example of camper-generated research results

**INTENDED AUDIENCE**: Academically motivated current (2025-26) high school and incoming 9th grade students interested in computers, math, science, and medicine.

**TUITION**:

University of Michigan in-person camps: $875

Scripps Research Translational Institute in-person camps: $950

All Virtual camps: $610

Students will receive a **$80 discount** for each additional camp purchased beyond the first.

Among the camps, only CB camp participation will qualify for the miRcore volunteer program.

2026 summer campers who want to get a 2026-27 student membership will get **$100 off** from the normal membership due.

After reviewing your essay in the application form, we will inform you regarding acceptance within 7-10 business days. If accepted, you will be sent payment options. **Limited partial scholarships are available for financially-challenged students such as those in free or reduced lunch program. Proof of income is required.**

*A computer is required for the camp.*

**Non-refundable Application Fee**: $75

### Students with camp certificates will be qualified to become [miRcore volunteers](https://www.mircore.org/volunteer/). Students in the high school volunteer program, which runs throughout the school year, determine a disease of focus for the year, collaborate with similar level students in researching the disease, and found/lead a school club [GIDAS](https://www.mircore.org/gidas/) (pronounced *guide-us*; Genes in Diseases and Symptoms). Out-of-state students can join the volunteer meetings through an online meeting platform.

### Camp Overview

|  | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theme | Genes in diseases | Wet lab experiments or Field trip | Statistics and biology | Gene networks | Social impact |
| Focus | Personalized medicine and DNA | DNA extraction | Gene expression and T-test | Protein functions and pathways | Molecular functions and diseases |
| Goal | Initial group presentations on a disease of choice | Determining a dataset for group research | Identifying RNA biomarkers in a disease | Identifying biological functions to focus on | Final group presentations  **PARENTS INVITED** |

**Refund Policy**

– The $100 administrative fee will not be refunded once the camp application is accepted.  
– If a student withdraws, the camp fee paid minus the administrative fee will be refunded if we are notified by April 30, 2026.  
– If a student withdraws between April 30, 2026 and three weeks before the camp starting date, we will refund 50 percent of the camp fee paid.  
– Refunds will be given until three weeks before the camp starting date.
