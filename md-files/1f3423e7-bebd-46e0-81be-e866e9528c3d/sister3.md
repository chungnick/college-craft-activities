# miRcore Research Camps for High School Students

**The Sequencing Your Genome camp is also open to college students.**

Having successfully run online summer camps during the pandemic, miRcore will hold Summer 2026 camps to pursue the best of both virtual and in-person camps. Our online format will allow nationwide reach and participation. Our in-person camps will provide students opportunities to perform experiments and build friendships with other regional students.

Our camps are available for academically motivated high school students (including incoming freshmen). We emphasize discussion in small groups of five or six campers, each group supported by its own teaching assistant throughout the camp. A unique feature of our camps is that students will be eligible to continue their learning experience with the [miRcore Volunteer Program](https://www.mircore.org/communication/), which meets throughout the school year online and in person (optional). MVP students continue learning about computational biology research, programming, teamwork, community outreach, and leadership (including founding/leading [GIDAS club](https://www.mircore.org/gidas/)).

MVP alumni testimonials

Marianne C.

### ***I showed up with low expectations and left in love. After the camp, I decided to start a GIDAS club at my high school and begin volunteering with miRcore. Now, I am lucky enough to spend every Saturday afternoon with other motivated high school students. I am constantly learning about and doing science. My experiences with miRcore have completely revolutionized how I see science and how I see my ability to participate in science. I now take higher level science classes at school, plan to pursue scientific research in college, and constantly barrage my friends and family with whatever science facts I’m excited with at the moment. But most of all, I am experiencing and participating in the future of science and medicine and having a great time doing it.***

Karthik R.

### ***I cannot stress enough how much you and miRcore have changed my life, not just by helping me get into UM or into the Koschman lab or this scholarship, but also for exposing me to the field of biological research and personalized medicine. Deciding to take the computational biology camp in 8th grade has been one of the best decisions. Without miRcore or the summer camp, I most definitely would not be in this position today.***

● Supported miRcore programs as a University of Michigan undergraduate  
● Supported miRcore programs while in master’s at Cambridge University, UK (Churchill Scholar)  
● Supporting miRcore while as a medical student at Stanford

Audrey G.

### ***Thank you so much for your letters of rec, as well as mentorship, guidance, and love over the years. I am so incredibly grateful for my experiences in miRcore, both as a student and as a leader. I am especially grateful to have met and worked with you. More than just a mentor, you are a friend and inspiration to me. I rely on the skills I learned from you and miRcore every day, and I also know that I could not be where I am today without miRcore ….***

## Summer Camps Offered in 2026

New for 2026 BTS and SYG camps: students will learn to use machine learning packages for their research projects as an introducction to AI in medicine. In BTS, they will predict whether samples are from COVID19 or flu patients. In the 3rd module of SYG, they will use their sequencing data to predict their ABO blood types.

If you are taking multiple camps, you pay only one application fee. Please use the same transaction id on multiple camp application forms. For additional questions, please email us at [camp@mircore.org](mailto:camp@mircore.org).

## [Computational Biology (CB) Research Camps](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-cb-camp/)

**Session 1 (University of Michigan or Virtual)**: June 15 – June 19, 2026

**Session 2 (University of Michigan or Virtual)**: July 6 – July 10, 2026

**Session 3 (Scripps Research Institute or Virtual)**: July 27 – July 31, 2026

## [Advanced Computational Biology (ACB) Camp](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-acb-camp/)

**Date**: June 22 – June 26, 2026

**Location**: University of Michigan or Virtual

We recommend taking a CB camp beforehand if possible.

The Advanced Computational Biology Camp (previously known as the R Programming Camp) provides essential tools and datasets with which students can develop their own research projects. Students will learn TCGA big data analysis using microRNA sequencing data of cancer patients for RNA biomarker analysis, tumor prediction using machine learning tools, and graph generation.

## [Biotechnology Sequencing (BTS) Camps](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-bts-camp/)

**Date**: July 13 – July 17, 2026

**Location**: University of Michigan or Virtual

We recommend taking a CB camp beforehand if possible.

The [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE)](https://micde.umich.edu/) has provided access to the University of Michigan’s high performance computing system [Great Lakes Slurm cluster](https://arc-ts.umich.edu/greatlakes/) for all BTS campers to run calculations in a Linux environment.

## [Sequencing Your Genome Camps](https://www.mircore.org/2026-summer-camp/2026-genome-camp/)

**Total 3 weeks**

**Module 1**: CB in-person preferred (Any camp okay)

**Module 2**: BTS (Date: July 13 – July 17, 2026)

**Module 3**: Analyzing your genome data (Date: August 3 – August 7, 2026 at Scripps Research Translational Institute or Virtual)

After their genome has been sequenced, students will be given access to a Linux cluster to do computational self-data analysis for one year (for non-medical research purposes only). Each student will be the sole custodian of their genomic data. Age: 16+ on the first day of Module 3 session. Both parental and student consent is needed. College students are also welcome.
