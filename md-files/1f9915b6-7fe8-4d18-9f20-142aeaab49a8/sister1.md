## Academy Experience

### **Where You'll Learn**

This academy takes place on campus at the University of Texas at Austin. Students get a taste of university life by learning in the [Gates Dell Complex](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/maps/UTM/GDC/) – the home of UT Computer Science.

### **Where You'll Stay & Eat**

You will stay in [student residence halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls) on campus where you’ll be matched with another student by age as your roommate. You can look forward to trying out college [residence hall food](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining) at breakfast, lunch and dinner, which is included.

### How You'll Be Supported

Our mentors help you get accustomed to learning on a college campus by staying in the same residence halls and accompanying you throughout your stay. Our academies boast an impressive **10:1 student to mentor ratio** to make sure students are getting the most out of their time on campus.

## Meet Your Academy Staff

**Dr. Sarah Abraham**  
Assistant Professor of Instruction  
Department of Computer Science

Dr. Sarah Abraham will be teaching students how to create games, using interdisciplinary skills from computer science, art, and design. She is a member of the Real-time Graphics and Parallel Systems group, with interests in non-photorealistic rendering, simulation-based tools for artists, and video game mechanics that foster cooperation and empathy. Dr. Abraham received her M.S. and PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, and her B.A. From Wellesley College.

**Allison Grindle**  
Academy Director  
Department of Computer Science

Allison manages the UT Computer Science Summer Academies, introducing high school students from diverse backgrounds to programming. She holds a BA from the University of Texas at Austin and an MA from King’s College London. With extensive experience in managing special programs at UT Austin and leading community outreach across Texas, she leverages her project coordination skills to create impactful learning experiences for participants.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

## How do I enroll? Is there an application?

Students do not need to submit an application for the Academy for Game Development. Click the “Enroll now” button on the webpage and you will be walked through the enrollment process in the Ideal-Logic portal. When you enroll, be sure to **select “Community Login,”** not “University of Texas Login” and select the correct program. Enrollment contains contact, emergency, and medical information, as well as subject matter-related background information and agreements for both participants and parents/guardians to sign.

## Do I have to have previous experience with programming or game development?

No programming experience? No problem! Our labs are designed to teach you to program or expand your programming skills to accomplish the project. All participants should be interested in games and the game development process.

## What is included with the cost of tuition?

The cost of tuition for the 6-day immersive academy includes housing, meals, instruction, and all educational and recreational activities.

Academy scholarships are available on a limited basis. Registrants with financial need can apply for a scholarship by completing the scholarship application, which will open with registration for the summer academies.

## What are the housing accommodations like? What are the meals like?

Students will stay in one of the residence halls on the UT Austin campus. To learn more about the UT Austin residence halls, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided for the academy participants. Students will eat at one of the main dining halls on campus. Top 9 allergen-free meals are available. For more information on dining, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls).

Each student will be assigned to a residence hall room with a roommate. Rooms are shared with another student of the same gender and all residence hall floors are split by gender. Each floor has counselors of the same gender as students on that floor. Please contact us with any specific questions.

## I have a special accommodations concern. Who can I talk to?

Please email our team at [academies@cs.utexas.edu](mailto:academies@cs.utexas.edu) and we will direct you to our Academy Accommodations Coordinator. Please be as specific as possible in your message so we can best assist you.

## How are participants supervised?

Academy participants are supervised at all times. Each participant will be placed into a group of around 10 students and will be supervised by a counselor 24 hours a day. Our daytime counselors, Program Assistants, provide supervision and help students in the computer lab and during programming activities. Our evening counselors, Resident Assistants, provide supervision and engage students in social activities and stay in the dorms overnight.

## What is the academy schedule?

Each day begins with breakfast at 7:30 am, followed by the first activity at 9:00 am. From 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, students dive into a mix of learning and hands-on experiences, either in the computer lab working on their small group projects or attending engaging faculty-led lectures. Students will also participate in guest talks and explore different departments around campus through guided tours. Throughout the day, students receive personalized guidance and mentorship from faculty and Program Assistants, ensuring they have the support they need to succeed in their game development projects.

After dinner, the fun continues with social activities such as bowling, movie nights, basketball, and other team-building events. All students return to their residence hall by 9:30 pm to wind down for the night.
