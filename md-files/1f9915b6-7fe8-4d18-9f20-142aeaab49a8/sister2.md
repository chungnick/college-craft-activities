## Academy Experience

### **Where You'll Learn**

This academy takes place on campus at the University of Texas at Austin. Students get a taste of university life by learning in the [Gates Dell Complex](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/maps/UTM/GDC/) – the home of UT Computer Science.

### **Where You'll Stay & Eat**

You will stay in [student residence halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls) on campus where you’ll be matched with another student by age as your roommate. You can look forward to trying out college [residence hall food](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining) at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is included.

### How You'll Be Supported

Our mentors help you get accustomed to learning on a college campus by staying in the same residence halls and accompanying you throughout your stay. Our academies boast an impressive **10:1 student to mentor ratio** to make sure students are getting the most out of their time on campus.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

## Where is the academy located?

The Academy for Machine Learning is hosted by the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin in the Gates-Dell Complex. All activities are hosted on the UT Austin campus, which is where students will stay for the duration of the program.

## Who can attend?

Students entering grades 10-12 in Fall 2025 are eligible to register.

## How do I enroll? Is there an application?

Students do not need to submit an application for the Academy for Machine Learning. Click the “Enroll now” button on the webpage and you will be walked through the enrollment process in the Ideal-Logic portal.

## Do I have to have previous experience with programming or machine learning?

No programming experience? No problem! Our labs are designed to teach you to program or expand your programming skills to accomplish the project.

## What will we be doing?

Students will explore programming in Python as they dive into the fundamentals of machine learning. They will learn from UT faculty and work alongside peers to implement machine learning concepts and discuss societal implications of the field.

Outside of lab time, students will attend guest speaker presentations, tour UT facilities, and join various social activities.

## Who are the instructors?

All UT Computer Science Summer Academies are led by UT Austin Computer Science faculty members. More information on each faculty member can be found in the Academy Staff section.

## What is the cost? What is included?

The cost of tuition for the 6-day immersive academy is $2,100. Housing, meals, instruction, and all educational and recreational activities are included in the cost.

Academy scholarships are available on a limited basis. Registrants with financial need can apply for a scholarship by completing the scholarship application, which will open with registration for the academies.

## What are the housing accommodations like? What are the meals like?

Students will stay in one of the residence halls on the UT Austin campus. To learn more about the UT Austin residence halls, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided for the academy participants. Students will eat at one of the main dining halls on campus. Top 9 allergen-free meals are available. For more information on dining, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls).

Each student will be assigned to a residence hall room with a roommate. Rooms are shared with another student of the same gender and all residence hall floors are split by gender. Each floor has counselors of the same gender as students on that floor. Please contact us with any specific questions.

## I have a special accommodations concern – who can I talk to?

Please email our team at [academies@cs.utexas.edu](mailto:academies@cs.utexas.edu) and we will direct you to our Academy Accommodations Coordinator. Please be as specific as possible in your message so we can best assist you.

## How are participants supervised?

Academy participants are supervised at all times. Each participant will be placed into a group of around 10 students and will be supervised by a counselor 24 hours a day. Our daytime counselors, Program Assistants, provide supervision and help students in the computer lab and during programming activities. Our evening counselors, Resident Assistants, provide supervision and engage students in social activities and stay in the dorms overnight.

## What is the academy schedule?

Typically, students have breakfast around 7:30 in the morning and begin their first activity at 8:30 am. From 8:30 am - 5:00 pm, students are either in the computer lab working on their group projects, taking a break for lunch, attending a guest lecture, or touring departments on campus. After dinner, students will participate in various social activities including bowling, movie night, basketball, and more. All academy participants return to their residence hall each night by 9:30 pm.
