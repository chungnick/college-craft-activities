## Academy Experience

### **Where You'll Learn**

This academy takes place on campus at the University of Texas at Austin. Students get a taste of university life by learning in the [Gates Dell Complex](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/maps/UTM/GDC/) – the home of UT Computer Science.

### **Where You'll Stay & Eat**

You will stay in [student residence halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls) on campus where you’ll be matched with another student by age as your roommate. You can look forward to trying out college [residence hall food](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining) at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is included.

### How You'll Be Supported

Our mentors help you get accustomed to learning on a college campus by staying in the same residence halls and accompanying you throughout your stay. Our academies boast an impressive **10:1 student to mentor ratio** to make sure students are getting the most out of their time on campus.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

## Where is the academy located?

The Academy for Women and Academy for All are hosted by the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin in the Gates-Dell Complex.

## Who can attend?

United States-based students entering grades 11-12 in Fall 2025 are eligible to apply.

## Can I apply to multiple academies?

Students are encouraged to apply to both Academy for Women and Academy for All sessions, if applicable. Please note that students will only be admitted to one session. If you apply to multiple sessions, you may list your preferences in the application.

## Do I have to have previous experience with programming?

No programming experience? No problem! Our labs are designed to teach you to program or expand your programming skills to accomplish the project.

## What materials are required in the application?

Students must provide their contact information, academic records, a brief essay, their most recent progress report, and an unofficial transcript.

## What will we be doing?

Join us as we use the Arduino microcontroller to program LED light displays - you will work with a small group of peers to make your lights put on a show or dance to music. Students in the Academy for All Machine Learning Edition will learn how to understand and implement machine learning concepts.

Outside of lab time, students will attend guest speaker presentations, tour UT facilities, and join various social activities. A field trip to a local tech company to meet corporate representatives and learn about their experience in CS may also be included in the weekly schedule.

## Who are the instructors?

All UT Computer Science Summer Academies are led by UT Austin Computer Science faculty members. More information on each faculty member can be found in the Academy Staff section.

## What is the cost? What is included?

There is no cost to participate in Academy for Women or Academy for All. Housing and meals for the week-long program are also included. Students may apply for travel scholarships for up to $500 to help pay for transportation to and from Austin if needed.

## What are the housing accommodations like? What are the meals like?

Students will stay in one of the residence halls on the UT Austin campus. To learn more about the UT Austin residence halls, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided for the academy participants. Students will eat at one of the main dining halls on campus. Top 9 allergen-free meals are available. For more information on dining, visit: [housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining/dining-locations/dining-halls).

Each student will be assigned to a residence hall room with a roommate. Rooms are shared with another student of the same gender and all residence hall floors are split by gender. Each floor has counselors of the same gender as students on that floor. Please contact us with any specific questions.

## I have a special accommodations concern – who can I talk to?

Please email our team at [academies@cs.utexas.edu](mailto:academies@cs.utexas.edu) and we will direct you to our Academy Accommodations Coordinator. Please be as specific as possible in your message so we can best assist you.

## How are participants supervised?

Academy participants are supervised at all times. Each participant will be placed into a group of around 10 students and will be supervised by a counselor 24 hours a day. Our daytime counselors, Program Assistants, provide supervision and help students in the computer lab and during programming activities. Our evening counselors, Resident Assistants, provide supervision and engage students in social activities and stay in the dorms overnight.

## What is the academy schedule?

Typically, students have breakfast around 7:30 in the morning and begin their first activity at 8:30 am. From 8:30 am - 5:00 pm, students are either in the computer lab working on their group projects, taking a break for lunch, attending a guest lecture, or touring different departments on campus. After dinner, students will participate in various social activities including bowling, movie night, basketball, volleyball and more. All academy participants return back to their residence hall each night by 9:30 pm.
