#### **Students have the opportunity to work with faculty, their graduate students and postdocs, and staff on research projects that can be laboratory or field-based.**

Many of our basic research projects have a translational alignment with practical problem solving applications for the agricultural community. The goal of the program is to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to plan and conduct experiments, evaluate data, communicate results, and learn about opportunities in agricultural and food research.
