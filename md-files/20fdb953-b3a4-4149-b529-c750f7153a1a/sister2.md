## What is NASEP?

An initiative of the [Office of Early Academic Outreach at The University of Arizona,](https://eao.arizona.edu/) the Native American Science & Engineering Program is a FREE year-long program designed to provide Native American high school students with the necessary resources to enroll in college and pursue a career in a Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) field. NASEP participants will gain a wide exposure to these fields through interactions with university experts on many subjects including environmental sustainability. The intention of this program is to expose students to a wide variety of STEM pathways so as to better inform their college pathways in the context of the Native American experience.

## More than Just a Summer Program

As stated above, NASEP is a year-long program that offers engagement throughout the academic year. Each group is seen as a cohort and will receive support from NASEP staff as they prepare to apply to college. Additionally, there are other events offered throughout the year that consists of 4 phases:

* **Summer Program Phase (June 2026):** Students will have a week-long stay on The University of Arizona campus participating in STEM related workshops. Past cohorts had opportunities to visit and stay at Biosphere 2, build a computer, computer coding, engineering projects, participate in lab research etc., tours and presentations from The College of Optics, College of Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
* **Research Project Phase (August 2026  - January 2027):** In the fall semester, students work on the [Geoscience research project](/aises-geosciences-outreach-program) where they gain exposure to the scientific method and creating and presenting collegiate level research posters at The University of Arizona's Native American College Day.
* **Enrichment Phase (September 2026 - May 2027):** Students will be given multiple opportunities to participate at events that include:
  + Fall Assembly at the Navajo Nation Fair & Parade: September in Window Rock, AZ
  + Tribal Environmental Health Forum: October in Chandler, AZ
  + Native American College Day at the University of Arizona: November in Tucson, AZ
  + American Indian Science & Engineering Society (AISES) Regional Conference: March
  + Southern Arizona Research, Science and Engineering Foundation (SARSEF) Fair: March in Tucson, AZ
* **Closing Banquet Phase (May 2027):** Students will be awarded for their participation in the program with a closing banquet at The University of Arizona and will receive a NASEP stole upon completion.

Each of these experiences is aimed at developing the students' understanding of STEM opportunities.
