# Quest Project

The Quest Project is a Pre-College program designed to educate and motivate Milwaukee-area middle and high school students and their parents to prepare for and attend college. Our aim is to provide information, support and encouragement so participants successfully complete high school and are prepared to enter college.

During the academic year the program offers workshops on a wide variety of topics that include, but are not limited to college preparation, career exploration, and leadership. Quest Project also offers educational field trips and hands-on learning opportunities.

### Eligibility

Students must meet eligibility requirements or have attended a designated summer partner program at one of the UW-System campuses. Once registered, participants may continue to participate in Quest Project until they graduate from high school.

### Registration is now open for the 2025-2026 academic year. Visit the link below:
