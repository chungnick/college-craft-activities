# Frequently asked questions about BSSP

**What is the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard?**  
The Broad Institute is a non-profit biomedical research institute in Cambridge, MA. The Broad brings together faculty and scientists from Harvard, MIT, and Boston's leading hospitals to tackle ambitious problems related to human disease, such as cancer, psychiatric disease, infectious disease, therapeutics, and more.

**How are applicants chosen to participate in BSSP?**  
Each application is reviewed holistically and evaluated based on factors such as strength of coursework, extracurricular interests, excitement for science, teacher recommendations, and ability to contribute to the Broad and BSSP communities in a meaningful way. All applications will be evaluated solely on the basis of merit. While applicants may choose to reference aspects of their background in their materials, selection will be determined exclusively by the above criteria.

**How will I be paired with a mentor?**  
Before matching students with mentors, we look closely at their skills and background knowledge to think about what type of research project would suit them. Although we try our best to place students with mentors based on their application responses regarding areas of interest, it’s not always possible. However, we strongly believe that any research experience at the Broad is going to be a positive one, and will expose students to the possibilities of biomedical research.

**What kind of research project will I be working on?**  
Students conduct a research project under the guidance of a mentor, and will present their results in a scientific poster session at the end of the program. Mentors develop the projects before students arrive at the Broad. The projects are well thought out and truly benefit the lab group students are part of. This is not a program where students are assigned “busy work” or unrelated tasks to complete. Some BSSP students choose to submit their research projects to various science competitions.

**Will I be working independently or as part of a group?**  
Students are paired with a mentor or group of mentors who will help guide their research. Although students are assigned to a specific mentor, they will be sharing a lab space or office with many scientists and will have the opportunity to become part of their community, attend lab meetings, and attend other events to learn about what members of their lab (and other labs at the Broad) are working on.

**Will I get to interact with the other BSSP students often?**  
We make a big effort to create a unified cohort of BSSP students. Although students spend most of their day doing research with their mentor, we do plan a number of program activities for students, including social events, team-building activities, workshops, special talks and panels, a college fair, and more.

**What kind of academic support is provided for participants?**  
An on-staff instructor meets one-on-one with students every week to help bridge the gap between what students already know from their high school classes and what they need to understand in order to do their research projects. During the first week, the instructor also runs a wet lab training exercise to help students learn some useful lab skills. Our staff also provides support related to creating scientific posters and preparing for presentations. We have an open-door policy if students need anything and remain actively engaged in each student's summer experience.

**I have to be away during some period of the summer. Can I still participate?**  
BSSP is a 6-week research program. Students are required to attend all program activities daily from 9:00am-5:00pm. Students can also attend optional evening activities, such as public lectures or social gatherings. Additional evening work, such as background reading or preparing for presentations of your work, is also expected. Students should discuss any scheduling conflicts with our staff prior to submitting an application.

**I am a current Junior who resides in a neighboring state and can commute to the Broad. Can I apply?**  
No, only current Juniors who attend a high school in MA are eligible to apply.

**I do not live in Massachusetts. Can I still participate if I find my own housing accomodations?**  
No, only students who attend a high school in MA and are able to commute to the Broad daily are eligible to apply.

## Did you know?

Broad Institute's gene-editing technologies—CRISPR-Cas9, base editing, and prime editing—are being tested in more than 25 clinical trials to treat or cure leukemias, rare genetic diseases, high cholesterol, and other conditions.

NIH-funded discoveries from the Broad Institute are powering nearly 20 clinical trials from companies testing new treatments for diseases like cancer and heart disease.

Broad Institute developed a technology — partly supported by NIH funding —  that can detect trace amounts of cancer DNA from blood tests and help cancer patients find out their risk of disease recurrence earlier.

Using NIH funding, the Broad’s Rare Genomes Project has worked with more than 1,300 families from all 50 U.S. states to diagnose rare genetic diseases.

Broad Clinical Labs has directly partnered with tens of thousands of cancer patients to analyze their DNA and accelerate research.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Broad Institute launched a large-scale diagnostic testing lab that processed over 37 million tests and saved state and federal programs nearly $2 billion.

The Broad Institute's Cancer Dependency Map helps cancer researchers and drug developers discover therapeutic targets for new cancer treatments.

gnomAD, a large human genetic variant reference database developed by the Broad Institute with NIH funding, has contributed to over 13 million genetic disease diagnoses since its launch in 2014.

Datasets generated at the Broad Institute were used to train AlphaGenome, a cutting-edge AI model from Google DeepMind that predicts how genetic variants affect gene regulation.

the FDA granted accelerated approval for a lung cancer drug that was developed with Broad Institute science and is for patients who otherwise had few treatment options.

David Liu and his team used NIH funding to invent precise gene-editing technologies, including one that may vastly improve access to genetic therapies for patients with rare disease.

NIH-funded Broad Institute research is shedding new light on the biological roots of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease.

Scientists with Broad Institute’s Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research have found key genetic factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Broad Institute scientists are using AI to design new antibiotics and other drugs, predict drug toxicity, and pinpoint genes, molecules, and cells that might be causing disease.

Broad Clinical Labs has sequenced nearly 900,000 whole human genomes, producing, on average, one human genome sequence every three minutes.

Broad Clinical Labs developed a new method for genome sequencing that costs 75 percent less than existing methods.

Broad Clinical Labs is the largest genome sequencing center of its kind in the world.

Broad Clinical Labs has partnered with MyOme and Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama to provide free genetic tests to people in Alabama.

Broad Clinical Labs has partnered with Mass General Brigham and Everygene to provide no-cost genetic testing to people throughout the US with cardiomyopathy, a disorder that can cause sudden cardiac death.

Broad Clinical labs and Mass General Brigham used data from NIH’s All of Us program to develop a genetic test that predicts risk of eight different heart conditions. This test is now available to patients.

Thanks to NIH funding, Broad Clinical Labs is collaborating with scientists across the U.S. to sequence DNA from tens of thousands of children with cancer and birth defects to study common biological pathways.

Broad Clinical Labs holds the world record for fastest DNA sequencing, completing whole genome sequencing and analysis in less than four hours at their facility in Burlington, Massachusetts.
