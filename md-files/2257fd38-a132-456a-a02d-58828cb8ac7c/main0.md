# Summer Enrichment Scholars Program (SESP)

Spend the summer with us!

## 

The **Summer Enrichment Scholars Program (SESP)** is for first-time, first-year students. It is designed to increase retention by providing comprehensive support in academic achievement, personal growth, identity formation, and intercultural development. SESP provides the skills necessary for college learning and social adjustment to thrive at the University of Vermont by immersing participants in a typical residential college experience, connecting them with resources in and around the UVM community, and fostering a sense of belonging within their cohort and at the University.

**The 2026 dates for this free two-week pre-orientation program are to be announced in the spring, along with instructions on how to apply.** SESP offers a unique opportunity to get a head start on your college experience. Throughout the program, you'll explore UVM, the Burlington community, and the broader Vermont area, getting to know the Mosaic Intercultural Center family and settling into your new space. You'll also learn about the "hidden curriculum", sustainable habits, and connect with individuals who will likely become your close friends for the next few years.
