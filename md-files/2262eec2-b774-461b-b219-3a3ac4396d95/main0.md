## Hoya Summer High School Information Session Webinar

Wednesday, Nov. 19, 4–5 p.m. ET

This information session will review our three programs: Non-Credit Academies, College Prep, and Summer College. We want to ensure that our prospective students are confident in their choice while planning their summer at Georgetown. We will provide an overview of each program and its respective application processes.

With the creation of a new world order after World War II, the United States came to be the indisputable leader of the so-called Free World. However, over the past several years, new forces in global and domestic politics have called into question the role of America in a changing world. This has especially been the case since the COVID-19 pandemic. What will be the future of American leadership? What will happen to the Atlantic Alliance? Will other great powers—like Russia and China—fill the possible void? What will be the future of American ideals, such as democracy and freedom?
