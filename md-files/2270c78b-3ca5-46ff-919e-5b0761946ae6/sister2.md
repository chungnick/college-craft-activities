# LEAPES- Learning, Exploration and Application for Prospective Engineering Students

---

## Applications closed

[Applications are closed](https://cresis.ku.edu)[Applications are closed](https://cresis.ku.edu)

# **Summer 2025 Residential Camps**

## June 22-27, 2025

### Aerospace Engineering and Artificial Intelligence

---

**We have planned a fun-filled approach to Engineering where students learn by doing!** Our summer camps will have hands on projects in each session.  Students will be housed in a dorm with a full meal plan.

This camp is hosted at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Totally free of cost except for transportation! Available only to rising juniors and seniors (aka current sophomores and juniors).

## Camp Faculty, Students and Staff

* [Two week camp for the class of 2026](https://cresis.ku.edu/aatee)

## Math

Learn basics of linear algebra and probability, two necessary mathematical tools for deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## Computer Science (CS)

Learn the fundamentals of optimization algorithms and computer code, which are critical for computations in deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## Aerospace Engineering (AE)

Learn about the basics of aircraft dynamics, control, and autonomy. Deepen your understanding through hands-on projects on unmanned aerial systems and performing actual flight tests.

## Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)

Build an autonomous car which can drive itself using a neural network model and a front-facing camera. Learn essential basics of AI systems by training a neural network model for the autonomous car on Google Colab cloud environment and testing the trained model on the actual RC car.
