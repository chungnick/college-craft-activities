#### **Anson L. Clark Scholars Program Application Details**

**The 2026 Application is open. See full details below.**

**Application Deadline:** February 16, 2026 at 11:59 PM CT.

#### Application Components

1. **Online application** (details on how to access the online application are below)
2. **Essays** - Short essays will be required for your application. (Essay prompts and character
   limits can be found [here](/clarkscholars/documents/essayprompts.php) and can be worked on in advance of application access.)
3. **High School Transcripts** - Transcripts must be uploaded to the application. Any AP Course test scores can
   be uploaded as well. (Transcripts and score reports do not need to be official.)
4. **College Admissions Standardized Test Scores** - Test scores should be entered and a score report uploaded. (At least a PSAT or
   PACT score is required if SAT or ACT scores are not available by the deadline.)
5. **Recommendations** - Three recommendations are required. At least two must be from teachers, and the
   third can be from a teacher, research mentor, principal investigator or from a volunteer
   organization. (Recommendations are completed through an online questionnaire and not
   an actual written letter. Be sure to communicate this to your recommenders. Instructions
   will also be automatically sent to referees once their information is input and saved.
   Recommendations are due at application deadline.)
6. **List of Top 5 Activities** - The student should list what they consider their most important involvment activities/accomplishments.
   These can include academic honors or awards, research programs, and other extracurricular
   activities in and outside of school. (Please note - The essay prompt about the applicant's
   most fulfilling service experience creates an opportunity to write about a sixth activity.
   Keep this in mind, as a resume or an additional list of activities is not allowed.)

**\*Supplemental information beyond the required application components will not be accepted.
Test scores received after the deadline will also not be accepted.**
