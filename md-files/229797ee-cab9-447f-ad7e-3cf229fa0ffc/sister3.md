#### **Frequently asked questions**

### What if I do not have my college admissions standardized test scores before submitting my application?

Test scores will not be accepted after the application deadline. PSAT scores will
be required if SAT or ACT scores are not available by the deadline.

  

### What age must you be to be accepted into the program?

Applicants must be 17 years of age by the program start date. NO exceptions. (This
means students will participate the summer prior to senior year or the summer after
senior graduation.)

  

### How many recommendations are needed?

Three. At least two out of three recommendations must be from teachers. The third
letter can be from a teacher or other individuals such as research mentors, principal
investigators or from volunteer organizations where the student is involved.

  

### Can those who have completed the 12th year of High School apply?

Yes. Students who will graduate right before the summer program are eligible to apply.

  

### Can my counselor submit a recommendation?

Yes

  

### You are asking for my counselor’s information. Do they have to submit a recommendation?

No

  

### When will the recommendation link be sent to my teachers?

Recommendation requests will be automatically emailed as soon as the applicant enters
the recommender information in their application and hits save in that section. This
should be completed in a timely manner, as recommendations are due by the application
deadline.

  

### Can my recommendation letter be faxed?

No

  

### What if my school is not listed?

Select "unknown school".

  

### When will students be notified of acceptance?

Decisions will be made no later than the first part of May. However, we will post
announcements of the expected notification timeframes if they are sooner on our Main
Page.

  

### May I send additional information to supplement my application?

No. Applicants may only submit the required application components.
