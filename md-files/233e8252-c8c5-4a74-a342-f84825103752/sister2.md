This program is a clinically oriented experience and students may be in patient areas during workshops, so it is important to know that they are healthy and do not have any communicable diseases, in particular tuberculosis.

If you have received the BCG tuberculosis vaccine, you will send need to send in a negative Quantiferon result.
