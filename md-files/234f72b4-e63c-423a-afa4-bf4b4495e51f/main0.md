# Gateway to Engineering and Bridge to Engineering Summer Programs

Gateway to Engineering and Bridge to Engineering are one week residence camps offered by UTA’s College of Engineering for junior and senior high students entering the 7th through 10th grades in fall 1999. These programs are designed to provide these students with a broad exposure to a variety of engineering disciplines, including aerospace, biomedical civil, computer science, electrical, environmental, materials science, and mechanical. Teams of engineering professors and graduate and undergraduate students teach the programs. Field trips supplement classroom activities.
