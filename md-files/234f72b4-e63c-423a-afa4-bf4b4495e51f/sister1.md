# Software, Hardware & Robots

The MARS lab employs the latest hardware and software tools thus providing excellent platforms to pursue advanced research in the fields of manufacturing, medical, micro – automation, haptics, human-robot interaction, and robotic systems.

A list of available resources with a short explanation is provided below. If you are interested to collaborate with the MARS lab, please contact Dr. Shiakolas (817-272-5715 or through email at [shiakolas@uta.edu](mailto:shiakolas@uta.edu)).

These resources, where appropriate, are also used for educational activities in order to expose the students to industrial strength tools and research activities undertaken in the lab.

---

## **Software Resources**

The computer systems in the lab operating in the Windows platform. In addition to the stand alone computers, the lab has access to the departmental and university computing facilities via network connections. In addition to the standard suite of office software the lab has access to the following software tools.

### LabVIEW

LabVIEW by National Instruments – Emerson is the software of choice for hardware interface, automation and control of devices. LabVIEW is a graphical programming development environment for data acquisition, hardware-in-the loop (HIL) and hardware control, and data analysis, visualization and presentation. LabVIEW is used both for educational and research activities.

### Autodesk Fusion and **Solidworks**

These are parametric, feature-based solid modeling software tools.

### **ANSYS**

This is a general prupose finite element analysis software package.

### **MATLAB, SCILAB, Mathematica**

These are integrated technical computing environments that combine numerical and symbolic computation capabilities with advanced graphics and visualization.

### **Slic3r, Repetier**

These are integrated environments used for our additive manufacturing, aka 3D printing, research.

### **Hardware Resources**

The hardware resources of the lab include research based testbeds and industrial strentgh devices. A number of research testbeds is availalbe, note that this research testbeds are modified according to the research undertaken in the lab. In addition, industrial strength hardware is available. The lab resources are used both for research and educational activities. Here is a list of available hardware resources:

* [5-DOF MicroNano robot](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#5XS)
* [FARO arm](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#FAROARM)
* [Falcon haptic joystick](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#FALCON),
* [National Instruments](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#NID)
* [RollingBot](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#ROLL)
* [Agilent high speed oscilloscope](https://mars.uta.edu/resources#OSC).

#### **3D printer platforms**

**Additive Manufacturing (AM) Transformation:**The lab is equipped with a number of 3D printers, three fused filament fabrication and one inverted vat polymerization.

We modified a commercial Creality Ender 3D printer and outfitted it with a vision system and a Raspberry PI model 2D computer for research intro quality control for additive manufacturing in situ and real-time.

#### **Magnetic Levitation System**

The magnetic levitation (maglev) system is developed by students in the MARS lab for real time controls research and educational activities. This system is controlled either using LabVIEW – myRIO or MATLAB – xPC Target setups.

The LabVIEW environment provides the ability to easily create more GUI features for research and educational activities.

The non-linear and dynamically changing system parameters make this an ideal environment for research in magnetic systems where non-contact manipulation is required. Possible areas of application of this technology are magnetic bearings, magnetically controlled surgical tools, micro-systems, haptics, etc.

#### **Custom 5-axis (XYZRP) meso – micro robot**

This is a custom build 5-axis servo based robot similar to a 5-axis CNC machine. It is not used as a CNC machine but as a robotic device.

Research in calibration and positioning correction has been performed on this device as it has the capability to be outfitted with a number of laser based position measuring sensors. It has excellent repeatability capabilities and is programmed within LabVIEW. It is used for research in Human Robot Interaction, Haptics and Calibration.

#### **National Instruments Devices**

The lab has been using National Instruments LabVIEW software and hardware components for a number of years. A number of NI data acquisition and motion control cards are available for research and educational activities.

NI devices include myRIO, cRIO (compact RIO), myDAQ, USB 6008/6009/…, bRIO (single board RIO), PCI 6221 (chassis and modules), cFP (compact field point chassis and modules).

#### **Custom 2-axis rolling robot**

This is an house developed two axis rolling robot. This robot has been employed for research in human robot interaction modalities, single and multiple obstacle avoidance, and is currently employed for semi-static or fully dynamically changing obstacles.The programming environment is within LabVIEW and the communication between the control computer and robot is through Bluetooth.

#### **Falcon 3-axis haptic joystick**

This is the Novint Falcon gaming joystick. We are using it in research for human robot interaction and haptics. It is a 3-axis joystick with three actuators to exert the desired haptic force. It is programmed within the LabVIEW environment using [Mauro S. Sette’s](http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~u0051044/) LabVIEW drivers.

#### **FARO 6-DOF 3D CMM**

This is a 6 degree of freedom FARO CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) for contact reverse engineering purposes or other processes such as robotic calibration.

#### **Active Compliance Force Device**

This is an active compliance force device by [PushCorp](http://www.pushcorp.com/Products/afd1000.htm). The device could be attached on a robot or used standalone.

#### **Agilent 500 MHz oscilloscope**

This is an high speed oscilloscope model DSO6052A operating at 500 MHz.   
[Specifications from the Agilent webpage](http://www.home.agilent.com/en/pd-564684-pn-DSO6052A/oscilloscope-500-mhz-2-channels?&cc=US&lc=eng):  
500 MHz Bandwidth  
2 analog channels

## **Robotic Manufacturing Cells**

## **Research and Educational Activities**  **Adept Robots Manufacturing Cells**

The lab has three advanced robotic manufacturing cells that include industrial robots along with a vision system and conveyors with encoder for coordinated robot/conveyor motion.

The industrial robots are an articulated Adept Viper S650, a SCARA Adept iCobra 600 and a cartesian (XYZ) Adept Python smart modules. More information about the Adept robots can be found at the [Adept web page](http://www.adept.com/). for [Viper S650](http://www.adept.com/products/robots/6-axis/viper-s650/general), for [iCobra 600](http://www.adept.com/products/robots/scara/cobra-i600/general) and for [Python linear modules](http://www.adept.com/products/robots/linear-modules/python/general).

The robots are outfitted with industry standard quick-connect disconnect devices that allow for ease of exchange of end of arm tools. The lab has a number of pneumatic end-effectors (2 and 3 actuators for parallel and angular motion) that could be outfitted with fingers to match part geometry for part manipulation.

#### **iCobra 600 SCARA Robot Cell**

This cell consists of an Adept iCobra 600 robot and an integrated conveyor belt with a camera. The educational projects are pick and place operations from the conveyor belt and identification of object orientation using the camera for correct placement.

The iCobra 600 robot is a four degree-of-freedom fully motorized SCARA type robot. The programming language is Adept ACE. The robot is outfitted with a quick connect end-effector that allows for the quick exchange of different pneumatic grippers.
