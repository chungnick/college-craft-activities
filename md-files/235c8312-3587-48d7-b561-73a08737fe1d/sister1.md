# Application Information

**Applications for summer 2026 are now open.**

Admissions are on a rolling basis, so act now.

[Apply now »](https://apply.lpsadmissions.sas.upenn.edu/apply/)

An online application is required for the Penn SAS High School Summer Programs. The admissions process operates on a rolling basis until full, and completed applications are reviewed in the order that they are received. It is an applicant’s responsibility to make sure that their application is complete. Please log into the application portal regularly to check the status of your application. It may take up to six weeks for an applicant to receive an admissions decision on a completed application.

We strongly recommend applying early to increase your chances of admission to your program of choice before it is at capacity. International students interested in residential programs should remember to allot time for visa processing and submit their applications early, ideally by February.

Penn LPS does not offer an admission deferral option; please be sure to apply to the term for which you plan to attend the program. Admission to our Penn SAS High School Programs does not constitute admission to a full-time program at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Admissions overview

Applications may only be submitted through our online application system.

A successful applicant should have:
