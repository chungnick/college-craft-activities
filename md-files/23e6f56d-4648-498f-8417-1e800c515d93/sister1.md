# FAQs

**Who should apply to HPREP?**  
HPREP applicants must currently be high school students (grades 9-12). Students who have enrolled in previous years are **not** eligible to participate again.

**Can students from outside Boston/Cambridge apply?**  
Our program happens in-person on the Harvard Medical School (Boston) campus on Saturdays. Massachusetts high school students who can access Harvard Medical School through the MBTA are welcome to apply.

**Should students have prior experience in medicine before applying?**  
Not at all! We are looking for students who are interested in science and medicine, but no prior experience is necessary.

**What do students learn in HPREP?**   
Students gain exposure to a broad range of topics and learn about different career paths. Our mentors are great resources for students who are currently applying/planning to apply to college. We encourage all students who are interested in science and medicine to apply.

**How many applicants apply and are accepted each year?**  
We usually receive over 100 applications each year. Approximately 75 students are accepted each year.

**What is the time commitment?**  
There are a total of 10 sessions from 9:30am-3:15pm on Saturdays, beginning in November and ending in February. We will **not** have classes during the weeks of Thanksgiving, and winter break. Full attendance, participation, and completion of assigned projects is expected of each student in order to complete the program.

**Are there rules on absences or tardiness?**  
Since our program only lasts for 10 sessions, we encourage students to attend as many sessions as they can to get the most out of their experience. We will not have HPREP on the weeks of Thanksgiving and winter break. If you are sick or are running late, please email us at hprep@hms.harvard.edu.

**Are students separated by grade level?**  
During the morning portions of HPREP Saturday sessions, all students attend the same lectures, labs, and workshops. During the afternoon mentoring portions of HPREP, students are organized into pods of 10-15 student-mentor pairs based on grade level. This is to tailor the mentoring based on the student’s needs (i.e. internship applications, college applications, scholarship applications, etc).

**Is there homework? How will I fit this with my school schedule?**  
The “homework” in HPREP is minimal. Students may be asked to email their mentors once during the middle of the week, or finish certain assignments before the next session. However, this should take no more than a few hours during the week. Since HPREP happens on Saturdays with minimal homework, students are able to attend HPREP while keeping up with school and sports/other extracurriculars.

**How do I apply to HPREP?**  
Our online [application](https://hprep.wordpress.com/application/) is available on the website in late August/early September prior to the upcoming HPREP year. The application involves short and long essay questions. Once applications are closed they will not be available again until the following year.

**Where does the program take place?**  
Saturday sessions take place at the Harvard Medical School campus in the Longwood Medical Area in Boston. We will provide more location details to admitted students and will have volunteers at the building entrance to show students where to go. Students are responsible for arranging transportation but convenient public transportation options are available. We will provide MBTA passes for students to use during the HPREP season.

**Do I have to pay to enroll?**  
Thanks to our generous sponsors, we are able to provide this program at no cost to our students. We provide snacks and lunch at our Saturday sessions as well as MBTA passes for students commuting to and from campus. All of the workshop materials are provided to students as well.

**Who runs HPREP?**  
HPREP is a student-led organization at Harvard Medical School. Our mentors, teachers, and organizers are medical and graduate students who love working with students and are committed to community outreach. Some of our special guest lecturers are doctors, professors, and professionals in science and medicine.

**Will I get a certificate for completing HPREP?**  
Yes!

**I have questions about the student application questions and/or essays.**  
Please visit our [Application](https://hprep.wordpress.com/application/) page for more details!

**I submitted my application. When will I hear back about whether I have been admitted?**  
You should hear back from us in October about your admission status. Please make sure to check the spam folder in your email!
