# ASE Internships

Inspiring the next generation of scientists & engineers since 1990!

[### Discover Career Pathways in STEAM

Spend your Day Off from school at Portland's leading organizations.](https://bit.ly/DaysOff-26)

**The 2026 ASE Application is OPEN NOW and closes March 6th at 11:59 pm.**

The **Apprenticeships in STEAM Exploration (ASE) program** connects motivated high school students with mentors in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) pre-professional internships. The driving value behind the ASE program is that the interns should contribute to and learn from the mentor's work.

Internships are four to eight week, part-time or full-time summer positions, designed by mentors themselves. These internships take place in the Portland and Corvallis areas, and historically Vancouver, Eugene, Bend, Klamath Falls, Colton, and McMinnville. Mentor organizations include universities, hospitals and research institutions and private companies. The application process is competitive, with more than 400 applicants each year for under 100 positions. ASE internships attract rising sophomores, juniors and seniors from throughout the Northwest, and roughly 70% of interns are from backgrounds historically excluded from the sciences. [ASE interns](https://www.saturdayacademy.org/student-interns) have been listed on published research, helped to design and test commercial products and spent countless hours in the field and in the lab.
