## Summer Academy 2025

### Embarking on a Journey, Navigating an Everchanging World

In July 2025, students were immersed in an enriching, exciting summer camp program designed to give young scholars an opportunity to experience college life. With both remote instruction and on-campus components, rising 10th-12th graders stayed in freshman dorms at SDSU, attended lectures, and completed research projects reflective of a public health concern in their community. Participants in Summer Academy not only became masters of a topic of their choosing, they also learned important skills to guide them towards their post-secondary education goals. This year, fun activities and field trips included a trip to a Padres game, an evening in Balboa Park touring museums, on-campus pool days and movie nights, to name a few.

### 

Through Summer Academy I learned about myself and gained new skills I can apply to the real world and school.
