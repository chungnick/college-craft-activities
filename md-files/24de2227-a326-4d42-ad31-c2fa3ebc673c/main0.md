# High School Research Program (HSRP)

The High School Research Program (HSRP) is a highly competitive six-week educational program for students interested in pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) studies.

### Program Overview

The HSRP program provides selected students access to a real-world scientific community and research experience that includes:

* Collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory’s scientific, engineering, and technical staff on hands-on projects that supports Brookhaven Lab and the Department of Energy’s mission to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions
* Research collaboration opportunities available onsite.
* Opportunity to share experiences as part of a poster session and/or oral presentation at the conclusion of the program

HSRP participants have the opportunity to be part of a wide array of projects, like [this study](https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=217384) done in support of COVID-19 research in which students conducted computational studies exploring inhibitor drugs that disrupt proteins that help infectious particles escape from cells.
