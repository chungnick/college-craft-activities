#### **RUSMP's Summer Camps and Programs for Students**

The Rice University School Mathematics Project offers a variety of programs for students including RUSMP's popular math summer camps and programs.

#### Summer 2026 Programs for Students

Preparing for Success in Precalculus (June 15–26, 2026; from 9am-noon) - **[REGISTER HERE (RUSMPS001)](https://glasscockcatalog.rice.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=58939484&showInternal=true)**

Preparing for Success in Calculus (July 6–23, 2026; from 9am-noon) - **[REGISTER HERE (RUSMPS002)](https://glasscockcatalog.rice.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=58940362&showInternal=true)**

*Registration Note: You need to create a family account first. Then, you should add a member (the student) to the account. Once these two steps are done, you can register the member(s) to courses.*

Each student class will be taught by a team of one Rice math faculty and one experienced master teacher. Students will enrich their mathematics backgrounds, prepare for their next math courses, and explore mathematics topics that may not be emphasized during the school year.

**Emphasis on:**

* Conceptual understanding
* Authentic, real-world problems
* Active learning
* Mathematical communication
* Proof and justification
* Responsible and effective use of AI for reinforced learning
* College and career readiness
