# Boys’ State

### A most rewarding experience

***Boys State general assembly.***

**American Legion Boys’ State is a week-long program that immerses high school youth (currently completing their junior year) in citizenship and leadership training. They learn the practical aspects of government as it exists in New York State, and come to recognize that the individual is integral to the character and success of government. They also participate in physical fitness, team work and other activities under the guidance of American Legion counselors and U.S. Marines.**

**Boys’ State takes place at Morrisville State College usually the last week in June. In 2026 it runs from Saturday, June 27 to Thursday, July 2.**

**If you or a youth you know would like to apply,** ***contact your local American Legion Post to inquire about sponsoring you to Boys State*.** **Once a Post agrees to sponsor you, you will receive a notification to go ahead and submit the online application to this year’s Boys State program.**
