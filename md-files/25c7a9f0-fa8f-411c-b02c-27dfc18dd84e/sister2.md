**WHAT IS BOYS’ STATE?**

Boys’ State is a program of the American Legion developed from the concept that youth should be
offered a better perspective of the practical operation of government; that the individual is an integral
part, and commensurately responsible, for the character and success of his government. As such, it
is an activity of high educational value, born of a need for youth training in practical citizenship.

To elaborate – Boys’ State is easily classified as a Leadership Action Program wherein qualified male
high school juniors participate in a practical government course designed to develop in the young
citizens a working knowledge of the structure of government and to impress upon them the fact that
their government is just what **THEY** MAKE IT.

To summarize – Boys’ State is an objective citizenship training program, which inculcates individual
responsibility to the community, state, and nation. It is operated on a two-party system on the basis
of the political government organization as it exists in New York State at all levels from local
municipalities to the State.

Boys’ State is not a summer camp! Although there will be designated recreation times, Boys’ State is
NOT a picnic – NOT an outing – NOT a sports camp. Sponsoring groups are asked to note that
Boys’ State is in no way a rehabilitative, disciplinary, or recreational camp. **Only young men with**
**outstanding qualifications in leadership, character, scholarship, service, and citizenship who**
**have a serious attitude toward an intensive citizenship training program should be selected.**
**Appearance, neatness, and good grooming are expected of Boys’ State participants. Attitude**
**and appearance go together and the ability to follow directions is a must. The image**
**projected by candidates to Boys’ State reflects upon the youth of America.**

Physical fitness is an integral part of Boys’ State. There will be time set aside for a physical program
to include calisthenics and marching to meals and assemblies to prepare the boys for the parade,
which is one of the high points of the program.

**WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF BOYS’ STATE?**

Naturally, a program of this scope and magnitude encompasses many objectives, all of which are
important, however, the objectives we feel are the most important and those for which we strive the
hardest to attain are as follows:

A. To develop civic leadership and pride in American Citizenship. It is our earnest hope that
each young man who attends Boys’ State will return to his community a better citizen than
when he left and that he will have a desire to demonstrate this fact by his willingness to
make civic contributions which will help make his community a better place in which to live.

B. To stimulate a keen interest in the detailed study of our government.

C. To incite in these young citizens a determination to maintain our form of government.

D. To develop in these young men a full understanding of our American traditions and a belief
in the United States of America.

The American Legion aims to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to their community, state, and
nation in these young men and to charge them with the safeguarding of the principles of America –
Democracy, Justice, and Freedom – the legacy of their forefathers.
