# Explore Microsoft Program

* ### Explore Microsoft Overview

  Imagine getting the opportunity to explore various software development roles within your first two years of college. If you aspire to be in tech and have an interest in majoring in a technical discipline like Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related technical discipline (ex. Information Technology, Data Science, Electrical Engineering and Cybersecurity), apply for the Explore Microsoft program.

  Explore Microsoft is an 8 week (India only) or 12 (US only) week summer internship program specifically designed for first- and/or second-year college students. The program allows the opportunity to experience the product development cycle's primary phases: Design, Build and Quality. Gain experience in software development through a learning program where you get the opportunity to work in a pod alongside other Explore Interns. Your on-the-job learning will be augmented with mentoring, community building and networking opportunities.

## Frequently asked questions

You will have an enormous responsibility, project ownership and impact during this 12-week session.

* ### How does Explore program differ from Microsoft's 12-week University Internship?

  Explore Microsoft is intended for students who are beginning their academic studies and would like to learn more about careers in software development through an experiential learning program.

  US Program: The Explore program provides challenging and impactful projects and is completed working in a pod alongside other Explorers. Explorers will experience both core tech disciplines over 12 weeks (Program Manager and Software Engineer), rather than specializing in just one.

  India Program: The Explore program provides challenging and impactful projects and is completed working in a pod alongside other Explorers. Explorers will experience in the software engineering discipline over the 8 week program.
* ### What can I expect to do during Explore Microsoft?

  You will work in a small team to complete a project for your product group through which you will gain exposure to the software development lifecycle: Design, Build and Quality.
* ### Will I work in a few groups during this experience, or focus on a specific goal in one group?

  We want you to be involved with your group project, so we will assign you to a specific product team while you are here. However, there will be plenty of opportunities to attend discussions about different Microsoft technologies and to learn from employees working around campus.
* ### There are two Explore Microsoft applications (first year & second year undergraduate student). Which application should I apply to?

  Microsoft’s second-year application is intended for candidates in their second year of a bachelor's degree program in the United States, Canada, Mexico or India. The Explore Microsoft’s first-year application is intended for candidates in their first year of a bachelor's   degree program in the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Please do not apply for both.
* ### Where is Explore Microsoft offered?

  Most of the opportunities are offered at our Redmond, WA, Atlanta, GA, and various India campuses.
* ### If I haven't declared a major, can I still apply?

  Yes. We do not require you be a computer science major to apply. However, we do require all candidates to have completed an Introduction to Computer Science (or equivalent course) and one semester of calculus (or equivalent). We are interested in individuals who have a demonstrated passion for technology and a desire to further explore the field of software development.
