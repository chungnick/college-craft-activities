No matter your financial situation, we are dedicated to making college as affordable as possible. The cost of attending college can be daunting. If you’re wondering how to pay for college, we’re here to help. [Check out this video](https://www.admissions.illinois.edu/invest/help-with-paying) to discover ways to make higher education more affordable. Plus, ACES awards merit-based scholarships based on your application.

### Figuring Out Your Cost

The exact amount you’ll pay depends on your major, where you decide to live, the meal plan you choose, and your overall lifestyle. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions provides estimated expenses [and a cost calculator](https://admissions.illinois.edu/Invest/tuition) to help.

To be considered for need-based scholarships and aid, you'll need to fill out the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa). You can also submit a [supplemental form](https://secure.admin.illinois.edu/osfa/scholarshipsupp/schoadd0.aspx) for scholarships awarded by the [Office of Student Financial Aid](https://osfa.illinois.edu/).

Tuition and fees are direct costs charged by the university. The cost of attendance also includes indirect cost allowances for food, housing, books, supplies, and other expenses. You will not be billed by the university for these costs unless you live in university housing. Use the [Illinois Cost Calculator](https://cost.illinois.edu/Home/Cost) for an estimated cost of attendance.

## ACES Student Scholarships

Body

ACES awards over $3.8 million in merit-based scholarships each year thanks to our generous alumni, corporate partners, and supporters.

First-year students are automatically considered for any College of ACES merit-based scholarships and [honors](https://aces.illinois.edu/academics/scholarships-honors/honors-societies) based on their admission application. No additional application is needed for first year applicants.

Continuing students are invited to apply for scholarships via one application that is emailed December 22 and closes February 20.

Off-campus transfer students are invited to apply for scholarships from June 1 - June 14 via their new Illinois email address. If you believe you never received this email, but are qualified, please email [ACES-Scholarships@illinois.edu](mailto:ACES-Scholarships@illinois.edu) for more information.

More information about the scholarship process is outlined in the FAQ below.

## Continuing Student Scholarships

ACES Undergraduate Research Scholarships

Since 1982, the College of ACES has supported the ACES Undergraduate Research Scholarship Program to provide research opportunities for qualified students who demonstrate superior academic ability and a strong interest in research.

### Eligibility

Students are eligible for the ACES Undergraduate Research Scholarship Program if they meet the following general requirements:

* Have sophomore, junior, or senior standing by the time that the project will be conducted.
* Official enrollment with a declared academic major in the College of ACES.
* Grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 or higher for their two most recent semesters.

Approved projects are funded up to $1,500 based on a project budget sheet submitted with the application. Students whose projects are approved are also awarded a $500 merit scholarship for the academic term during which the research project is conducted.

### Application

Project proposals are accepted and reviewed on a semesterly basis. The application deadline for fall semester projects is **May 1**, and the application deadline for spring semester projects is **November 1**. However, submitting project proposals a few months before starting the research project is strongly encouraged. The Faculty Research Mentor for the proposed project needs to have a current faculty and/or research appointment within the College of ACES.

Applicants are strongly urged to identify and define an appropriate research project well in advance of their application date. Application forms and additional program information are available from the Honors Desk in the ACES Academic Programs Office.

#### Preparing a Research Proposal

Project proposals should follow the format shown on the application form and are limited to two pages, a budget sheet, and a title page. The project budget should itemize all funds necessary to support the proposed research. Allowable expenses include laboratory supplies (e.g., chemicals, glassware, biological materials, etc.), other disposable supplies, and off-campus travel necessary to collect data. *Funds will not be provided for wages or major equipment purchases.* Any budget items that are not self-explanatory should be justified in footnotes.

#### Presentation of Research Findings

A project report (two or three pages) summarizing research findings should be submitted by email to [aces-jshp@illinois.edu](mailto:aces-jshp@illinois.edu) after the project. Students are also expected to display their findings at the ACES Undergraduate Research Day in mid-April; in a poster session at the Campus Undergraduate Research Symposium in late April; at an approved departmental meeting/seminar; at a professional/scientific conference; or at another scholastic event or professional meeting approved in advance by the Honors Director.

An undergraduate researcher whose paper or poster has been accepted and who plans to present research results at a professional meeting may apply for up to $800 to help with travel expenses.

Projects that lead to the publication of full-length papers in peer-reviewed journals may qualify for up to $500 toward publication expenses. To qualify, the published paper needs to list the undergraduate researcher as an author and acknowledge the support of the ACES Undergraduate Research Scholarship Program.

Requests for supplemental funding (application forms downloadable below) should be directed to [aces-jshp@illinois.edu](mailto:aces-jshp@illinois.edu) and need to provide evidence that an appropriate research paper or poster has been scheduled for presentation and/or accepted for publication. **Requests for travel funds should be submitted to the Honors Director at least 30 days before professional meetings.**

#### Academic Credit

Undergraduate researchers may receive academic credit (typically up to three hours) by registering for an independent study course (usually a 200-level course [for non-James Scholars] or a 300-level course [for James Scholars or Chancellor's Scholars]). Standard registration procedures should be observed, with the final grade to be assigned by the Faculty Research Mentor after all project requirements have been met.

**SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS**

In return for receiving the ACES Study Abroad Scholarship, recipients must complete the following:

1. Write a one-and-a-half to two-page reflection and evaluation of your study abroad experience, which will be posted on the [Voices of ACES](https://aces.illinois.edu/blog) and the [Study Abroad Student Stories blog](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7437). In the reflection, you can answer questions including (but not limited to):
   * What did you learn through this program?
   * Which events were most meaningful to you and why?
   * What does the experience mean to your academic/career plans?
   * How did the experience affect you as a person?
   * Which individuals you encountered or which events contributed to those feelings, thoughts, and plans?
   * Save as**LastName\_Country\_Year**(eg. Johnson\_France\_2021)
2. Volunteer at one study abroad event as an ambassador of your program. This could include the study abroad fair, a program info session, a classroom visit, an RSO presentation, a pre-departure orientation, etc. ACES Study Abroad will send you a list of potential activities and instructions via email.
3. Submit a photo galleryby using the following link. Email 10-15 of the top appropriate\* photos you took while abroad.
   * Please save your photos in JPEG format as: **LastName\_Country\_Year**(eg. Johnson\_France\_2021)
   * Program-related pictures that feature the host university, classrooms/labs, living quarters, host family (if applicable), field experience, etc.
   * No more than five photos from extended travel  
       
     \*Appropriate photos mean no alcohol, illegal substances, or weapons, photos of others who have not agreed to have their picture taken (especially children), and no photos that represent your trip in a negative light. Be selective about the content you share. Ask yourself: Would this be something I would want my family to see? Would I want it on the front page of the newspaper? How I am representing the University of Illinois?

Scholarship requirements can be submitted directly in [My Study Abroad](https://app.studyabroad.illinois.edu/). Please login and then click on the ACES Study Abroad Scholarship application. Once there, you should see places to upload your essays and photos. ACES Study Abroad will mark off the volunteer requirement on the back end after you have attended an eligible event.
