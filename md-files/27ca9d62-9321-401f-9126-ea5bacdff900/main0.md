The National Scholastic Press Association has presented scholastic journalism’s preeminent award — the Pacemaker — since 1927.

Winners are announced at JEA/NSPA National High School Journalism Convention, both fall and spring. NSPA membership qualifies a publication for participation in the Pacemaker competition.

High school and junior high/middle school student media are both eligible and compete in separate categories.

Participation in the Pacemaker contest is a benefit of NSPA membership. There aren’t additional entry fees.

NSPA’s Best of Show competition is presented as part of each national convention, both fall and spring.

It’s a popular, lively competition open to convention registrants, with an entry fee and a range of competition categories for current student work.

The current convention’s webpage will post that convention’s Best of Show contest rules, rates, eligibility and submission guidelines. Links to convention webpages are at right, as well as on **[the NSPA Events page.](https://studentpress.org/nspa/events/)**

Entries for Best of Show Individual Recognition categories are submitted online prior to the convention, and Staff Recognition categories are entered on site at the convention. Judging is completed during the convention, and ranked winners are announced and posted at the close of the convention. Best of Show provides no written critiques or scoring rubrics.

Typically smaller and distinct from the Pacemakers, the Best of Show awards do not signify a ranking of national excellence but rather overall excellence among the attendees and their entries. Convention attendance drives the number of entries and places awarded.

To earn the NSPA Leadership Award in Student Journalism, a high school student must serve with distinction for at least two years on the staff of an NSPA-member broadcast, literary arts magazine, newspaper/newsmagazine, specialty magazine, website or yearbook by the end of the current school year.

Students are nominated by their advisers. A specific grade-point average is not required; however, students must be in good academic standing and demonstrate journalistic excellence and staff leadership while maintaining the high ethical standards outlined in the NSPA Model Code of Ethics. The code is free for members through **[the NSPA Store.](https://studentpress.org/nspa/store/)**

Advisers must submit nomination forms by **Feb. 10, 2025**. The form is on **[the membership portal](https://nspa.member365.com/crm/home)** under the Contests tab.

Inductees receive a certificate of recognition and are eligible to wear the NSPA Leadership in Student Journalism teal honor cord at graduation, as well as being listed on the NSPA website and on the pages of the Best of the High School Press.

In early April, advisers will receive a PDF file with printable certificates for presenting to their inductees at year-end recognition ceremonies.

Seniors earning the NSPA Leadership Award in Student Journalism may apply for a $1,000 scholarship. **[Scholarship applications](https://nspa.member365.com/publicFr/form/index/86600af90e2f339899359164030096b85687c936)** are due March 3, 2025.
