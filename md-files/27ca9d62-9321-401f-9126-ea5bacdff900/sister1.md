# Join NSPA

NSPA membership is by publication, not by school or individual. If your school has a yearbook and newspaper, you need to have one membership for each publication.

You can join at any time and your membership will last through the school year. As a member, your staff will be notified of all contests, conventions and deadlines. All members are eligible for discounted registration fees at conventions.

If you need to renew an existing membership, please [log in here](http://nspa.member365.com/). If you believe your publication has an existing membership but are not able to log in, please [contact us](https://studentpress.org/nspa/about/about-contact/) before creating a new membership.
