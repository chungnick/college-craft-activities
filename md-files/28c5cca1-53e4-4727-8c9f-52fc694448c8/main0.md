# International Relations: How the World Works

The subject of international relations is more relevant than ever. We are living through a time of disruption and promise. On one hand, technology offers more people a voice—on the other, populist movements threaten democracy. The world economy is strongly connected, yet threats like pandemics shut down supply chains and cause shortages. Industry is more productive, but causes environmental ills. How do these problems and potentials interact? What will your role be in the future? If you are interested in international relations, politics, law, economics or just curious about how our world works, this course is a must. Choose from our enrichment and college credit options, and discover this exciting subject today.
