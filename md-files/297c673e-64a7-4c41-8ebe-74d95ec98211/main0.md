## About the Program

The Mentor Assistant Program (MAP), a part of the San Diego Supercomputer Center’s (SDSC) student outreach program, is a campus-wide program, engaging high school students in a mentoring relationship with an expert from a vast array of disciplines, from History, Marine Physical Sciences and Nanoengineering to Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Athletics and Computer Science.

## How MAP Works

**The UCSD Mentor Assistance Program (MAP) is an opportunity for motivated high school students to work with a UCSD mentor for an eight-month period from fall to spring of the following year.**

Students may seek guidance on class projects, delve deeper into a research project or interests, create a winning Science Fair projects, request regular visits with the mentor’s lab or work space or use this opportunity to learn more about a potential research or career interest through assigned scholarly or practical readings and discussions with their mentor.

As an example, if a student does not have a project in mind, but is interested in a particular area, such as bioinformatics, sports medicine or linguistic, the mentor can assign a scholarly article every other week and then the mentor will have bi-weekly discussion with the students about the articles, allowing the student to gain added knowledge to make continued education and career decisions.

We encourage students to make the most of this opportunity, as they will have 1:1 access to the mentor’s expertise. With this mentorship, there is not a specified number of hours required per week by the student. Rather, it is up to the student to determine their needs within the scope of this opportunity and to work with the mentor to achieve these goals. As a guideline, we recommend students spend 2-4 hours per week working with their mentor during the academic year.

**The opportunity to work with prestigious scientist and staff personnel is something very special, and we encourage you to make the most of it.**

## What the Program Does Not Offer

The MAP program is not a tutoring program. Please do not complete an application because you need assistance with AP Biology or AP Chemistry. The MAP program is also not an internship program; however, a summer internship may be offered to a student upon completion of the eight-month mentorship.

## Administration of the MAP Program

The MAP Mentoring Program is administered by UCSD School of Medicine and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  
  
The Mentoring Coordinators facilitate the administrative on-boarding volunteer process for students and background check for mentors, as well as pairing of Faculty and Post Doc mentors with San Diego County high school students in grades 10-12.  
  
**The Mentoring Coordinator has four main responsibilities:**

1

Facilitate the matching and notification of mentoring pairs

2

Provide a one-time Fall orientation for mentees, and maintain communication with mentees and mentors to discuss progress of mentor-mentee pairs

3

Research, develop, and maintain a comprehensive university-wide resource list of all faculty development resources, programs, and opportunities on campus

4

Maintain the MAP website for the mentors and mentees on which is posted a variety of resources and through which regular communication can be maintained with mentors, mentees, and interested campus and community members

## Program Fee

**Application Fee: Free  
Research Project: $1000  
Non-Reseach Project: Exempted Registration Fe**e

Due to the rising administrative costs associated with the REHS program, it has become necessary to now charge a $1500 registration for this coveted eight-week experience. As a non-profit entity, it has become increasingly difficult these past few years to cover program expenses. We have embraced the support that you as a community have given to SDSC and REHS, and we hope that this registration does not impact the support you have given us for the past decade.

Financial assistance is available. In addition, students who qualify for free and reduced lunch will be exempt from the registration fee.

## Transportation Options

If you know that you will need transportation to get to the main UCSD campus, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography or the UCSD Medical Center, please do not worry. We will provide student with transportation needs an MTS ComPASS card for the mentorship period.  
  
Once we receive word from your mentor that you have been selected, we will email all selected students to ask if there are transportation needs. This will be your chance to let us know.  
  
For now, though, don’t worry and just concentrate on finding the perfect mentor for you!

## The MAP Mission

The mission of the MAP program is to enhance a student’s lifelong personal development in teaching, scholarship, and service. The mentoring relationships will support collegiality, effective communication, self-evaluation, and cultural competence, all of which enhance a stimulating and supportive university environment.
