## Commitment to the MAP Program

Both students and mentors are expected to commit their time and effort for the length of the MAP program.  
  
Participating students are asked to:

* Contribute ~2-4 hours per week to the MAP mentorship.
* Have flexibility within their schedule to work around the Mentor’s availability.
* Participate in the on-campus activities which typically occur every 8-10 weeks, on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings.
* Present their work in the form of a poster and mini-slide talk at the end of the year MAP Symposium.

If you are willing and able to commit to this year’s MAP program (i.e. you agree to fulfill the above four obligations), we welcome your application.

## The Application

Students will be completing an online application. You may start it and come back to it, so you do not have to complete it all at once. Students may submit their application prior to the submission of your letters of recommendation.  
  
Recommendation letters may not be submitted separately and must be submitted by the application deadline. Late letter submissions will not be considered.  
  
Please complete the MAP application thoughtfully and neatly. You cannot take back a first impression.

Please Remember To:

* Address your cover letter to your first choice mentor.
* Provide a well crafted resume.
* Write thoughtfully. Check for spelling errors.
* Be honest. If your grades slipped a little, explain why. We all have issues that present themselves and that sometimes hinder achievement. A simple explanation is all you need.
* Write a thoughtful essay as to why you wish to participate.
* Be thorough. Refer to the checklist before submitting your application.

Please DO NOT:

* Ask your parent to write your essay.
* Reuse a school essay. We can spot these a mile away!
* Use slang. (Yes, this has happened.)
* Address the mentor incorrectly in your cover letter. Please be sure to use Dr. when warranted and please do not use Dr. when the mentor does not have a doctorate. This seems like a small mistake, but it can count against you.

Applications must be submitted by **11:59pm on the specified deadline**. After this time, the system will close and you will not be able to submit an application. Hand delivered, mailed, or overnight express mail applications submitted during the application period or after **will not be accepted**.  
  
Once applications are received, MAP mentors will be contacted for application review and student selection.

## Mentor and Project Selection

Approximately **50 renowned research and staff mentors** have signed on to participate in MAP.  
  
Each MAP mentor has indicated his/her level of participation in the MAP program as follows:

Before reviewing the mentor list, students should consider their own goals with regard to the program:

* Is this an opportunity to learn more about a particular research interest?
* Or an opportunity to confirm a passion for a certain career goal?
* Or maybe the student wishes to know more about a particular topic, such as neuroscience, before setting their sights on this as a career goal?

KNOW

Your expectations for the program before viewing the mentor list as you do not want to confuse yourself with the broad range of disciplines and departments that the mentors represent.

REVIEW

The [MAP mentor list](https://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/map-mentors/) thoughtfully and unhurried as there is quite a bit of information to absorb. The MAP mentors are listed alphabetically by department and discipline. Each mentor has provided a photo, biography, lab or workplace focus, and their level of participation in MAP.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

Mentors will be reviewing all submitted applications and will make their own selections. MAP Coordinators are not involved in the selection process.  
  
If you have any question while viewing the mentor page in the right navigation column. Please DO NOT contact the mentor directly, but rather contact the MAP coordinators.

## Parents Dos and Don’ts

Please **Do**:

* Encourage your students to apply. Remember, although we do value your student’s GPA, mentors are also looking for other criteria that make your student a well-rounded individual, such as volunteerism, care taking, community involvement, sports, hobbies and a desire to learn.
* Spread the word about this program to your friends, neighbors and colleagues. It is a wonderful opportunity for all high school students!
* Encourage your student to apply even if your student has a GPA less than a 3.0. As long as your student is college bound, the application will be considered.

Please **DO NOT**:

* Call for information on your student’s behalf. Your student should be the one contacting the MAP Coordinators for information.
* Try to persuade the MAP Coordinators to allow your 13, 14 or 15 year old student to be able to participate. Students must be 16 years of age.
* Attempt to bypass our policies and guidelines with regard to eligibility requirements.
* Contact the MAP Coordinators for the status of your student’s application. We do not know that information. Mentors have been asked to make selections by July 1st. If there is a delay, please refer to the MAP website.

## Application Review Process

All MAP mentors will receive their online student applications by the third week in March. Mentors will use their own matrix for their student selections. MAP coordinators will not persuade or influence any mentor decisions. Mentors will be asked to make their student selections by early June for summer start dates and mid-July for fall start dates.

## Need Guidance?

Please do not hesitate to work with your school counselor to discuss how the MAP program can help you advance your research or career interests and goals. Many of your school personnel attended a MAP Overview session and may have the answers you need.  
  
Please also feel free to contact the MAP Coordinators for guidance. We are here to help! Please contact Ange Mason of the San Diego Supercomputer Center (amason@ucsd.edu, 858 534-5064). We are available to provide guidance and answer any questions you might have. Just ask!
