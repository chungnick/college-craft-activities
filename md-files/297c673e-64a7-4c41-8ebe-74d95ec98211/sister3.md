## Computer Science

Dr. Paul Y. Cao

PhD, Department of Computer Science

view bio

Paul Cao is currently a continuing lecturer in the CSE department at UC San Diego. His  
research area is in CS education and he is particularly interested in the broadening of  
CS exposure and education in the K-12 domain. He has extensive teaching experience

University.

**Project Description:**

-Development of Scratch projects suitable for elementary school  
students

-A large percentage of current CS education at the K-12 level focuses on the  
development of child friendly coding projects using block-based programming  
languages. The quality of projects varies drastically and the maintenance and updates  
on these projects lack long-term support. In this project, we will investigate remixing  
some of the most popular Scratch games and projects and focus on the fundamentals  
of flow control, events handling, variables, and AI related topics. We will create a  
repository these games with a remix plan. The primary advantage of remixing popular  
games is strong student interest. And this project can be easily maintained and updated  
with new popular games.

Dr. Wu is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego School of Medicine. His research is focused on signaling and trafficking of neurotrophic factors in health and in neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, his group has been a leader in studying axonal transport. Axons are the primary target in many neurodegenerative diseases associated with both the central and peripheral nervous system. Dysfunction and degeneration of axons  i.e. axonopathy, is often the earliest sign of neurodegeneration.  We use molecular, cellular, biochemical, and imaging methods to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of axonopathy and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Tauopathies, Huntington’s disease (HD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD).  Our ultimate goal is to understand how impairment of axonal functions leads to neurodegeneration in these diseases. In addition, he has been investigating the molecular mechanisms underpinning peripheral sensory neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) and Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy V associated with Swedish NGF mutation.

Dr. Valentina Kouznetsova

Project Scientist, San Diego Supercomputer Center

view bio

I work for the San Diego Supercomputer Center and the Moores Cancer Center of University of California at San Diego.  
  
**Research Interest:**  
My research interests include Computer-Based Drug Design, Metabolomics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Computational Structural Biology, Gene Networks Analysis, System Biology, Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Visualization, and Image and Morphometric Analyses.I focus on pharmacophore development and drug design; protein modeling and simulations; microarray data processing and analysis; pathway and gene-network analysis, development of metabolic markers for cancer and other diseases diagnostics. Recently I proposed a new method of pharmacophore hypotheses generation for one of the most difficult problems in pharmacophore-based drug design—protein interface inhibitors. My strategy was proved with a computational design of the OLIG2–E47 transcription factors (TFs) interface inhibitor. This concept leads to the creation of new drugs for cure of brain cancer. One of my significant works was time-series microarray analysis of kidney gene expression using SOMs and reversed Tsallis entropy that led understanding of kidney organogenesis The analysis revealed distinct transitions in specific days of kidney development and paved the road to development of targeted medications that will affect the TFs in specific day of organ development. This work was published in Science Signaling journal.In another significant work published in Genes, Brain and Behavior this approach was applied to brain development. The methods were extended with TF network and pathway analysis that allowed finding specific TFs and networks for drug intervention in cure of mental disorders as ASD and schizophrenia. I use the concepts outlined in this work for selection of target TFs for drug design.Another area of my interest is metabolomics for cancer cure.I work in collaboration with biochemists, biologists, and medical researchers from different laboratories and consult them in drug design, planning experiments, analysis and comparison of biological data, information theory, and other fields of computer engineering.

Seeking to empower today’s science and engineering communities and helping develop the next generation of scientists, technologists and engineers.
