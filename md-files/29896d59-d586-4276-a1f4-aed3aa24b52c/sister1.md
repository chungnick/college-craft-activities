[Apply for SMT In-Person!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSIsZtoJR4Ur0xwXUjCmZWpdyhauyxGj5R5IffHkLxxvJiUg/viewform)

[Register for SMT Online!](/competitions/smt-2026-online)

*SMT is only for US high school students. If this doesn't apply
to you, we encourage you to participate in  [SMT Online](/competitions/smt-2026-online)  instead.*   
   
\*Humanitix charges around $2.00 per student in service fees.

# Application Information

SMT 2026 will be inviting **800 students** (~130-160 teams) from
around the United States to compete in-person at Stanford. We are now
accepting applications
for our in-person tournament from
**schools, local mathematical organizations, and individuals**
from the United States. Students who are unable to participate in-person
are invited to register for our
[online tournament](/competitions/smt-2026-online).

#### Schools

Students are highly encouraged to participate in SMT 2026 as part of
their **school team**. Students whose school is sending a team to SMT
must attend with their school.
*Please note that we will only accept school teams with exactly 5 or 6
participants. If you have fewer than 5 members, consider applying as
individuals.*

#### Local Established Mathematical Organizations

Students who do not have the opportunity to participate in SMT as part
of their school may participate as part of a **local established mathematical organization**, defined as organizations with students located in a 50 mile radius of
its headquarters that (1) conduct mathematical enrichment activities
beyond competition participation and (2) provide clear avenues for any
student to get involved.
*Students may participate as part of an organization if and only if a student's school is not sending a team to SMT.
Please note that we will only accept teams with exactly 5 or 6
participants. If you have fewer than 5 members, consider applying as
individuals.*

#### Individuals

If you are not applying as part of a team to SMT 2026 in-person, you may apply
as an **individual competitor**. However, students are heavily encouraged to form teams with their schools.
Students who register as individuals
will be placed in a team with 5 other individual competitors, based on
geographic proximity. *Individuals may have a lower chance of being
accepted to compete in SMT than students participating as part of a
school or organization.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding eligibility to compete as an individual, please email us at [info@StanfordMathTournament.org](mailto:info@StanfordMathTournament.org).*

#### Selection Method

We will reserve spots for **top school teams** (non-orgs) from SMT
2025 and for teams that are **low-income** and/or
**historically underrepresented** in mathematics. The rest of the spots
will be assigned via a lottery, with preference given to school-based teams,
followed by local organizations and individuals.

#### Questions or Concerns?

Reach out to [info@StanfordMathTournament.org](mailto:info@StanfordMathTournament.org).

*These criteria only apply for SMT 2026 in-person, not for SMT 2026
Online. These selection criteria are not final; they may change as we
work to promote both diversity and a competitive spirit. Decisions
made by SMT are final and non-negotiable.*

# Test Information

Loading...

The **Power Round** is a 80-minute exam focused on proof-writing.
The content of the test focuses on a single subject matter that is usually
significantly different from traditional competitive math problems.

The **Team Round** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short
answer questions.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute individual exam
consisting of 25 short answer questions that is designed for students that
have less specialized mathematical background.
  
*The General Test is worth 60% of the Subject Tests*.

The **Subject Tests** are two 50-minute individual exams
consisting of 10 short answer questions. The subjects offered are
**Algebra, Calculus, Discrete (Number Theory & Combinatorics), and
Geometry.**

The **Guts Round** is an 80 minute live-scored team exam consisting
of 8 series of 4 questions each, whereby teams must submit answers to a previous
round in order to gain access to the next. Subsequent rounds are both harder
and worth more points than previous rounds.

# FAQ

Q: How many students may be on a team?

A: Teams must consist of 5-6 members. Teams with less or more students will not be accepted.

Q: Which students may participate in SMT 2026 in-person?

A: Students must be in high school to participate in SMT 2026 in-person. However, SMT 2026 Online is open to students of all grades.

Q: Can I participate in SMT remotely?

A: Yes, see the SMT Online Page.

Q: Can I apply for SMT 2026 as an individual?

A: Yes, you can apply as an individual if you are unable to go as part of a school team.

Q: Do students on the same team have to be from the same school or established mathematical organization?

A: Yes, students must be from the same school or mathematical organization. If a student's school is participating, however, that student cannot participate through an organization. If a student is participating as an individual, they will be matched with teammates before tournament day.

Q: What schools or organizations can participate in SMT?

A: SMT 2026 will be open to all domestic students from US-based schools or organizations.

Q: Can international teams participate in SMT? If so, how do they register?

A: Yes, but they must participate in SMT Online - see that page for more details.

Q: Are calculators allowed?

A: No. Calculators are not allowed on any portion of the tests. Check the SMT rules for information on permitted items.

Q: What topics may appear on the tests? How hard are the tests?

A: See the mathematical expectations document for guidelines on what topics may appear on each test. It is also advisable to look at the test from previous years in order to get a sense of the typical style and difficulty of SMT tests.

Q: Which individual test should I take?

A: If you have little or no experience with contest math, we strongly recommend you take the General Test. Looking at past tests will help you get a sense of the difficulty of each test.

Q: Do we need to have a teacher or coach attend SMT in person?

A: Yes, you must have at least one authorized adult chaperone present per team who is responsible for the team during the tournament. This can be a parent of a team member or a coach.

Q: Can I use the problems from previous SMT tests listed below in my classroom/book/etc?

A: Yes! Feel free to use any officially released problems, provided you cite us in the format 'Stanford Math Tournament [Year] [Round] [Problem #]'
