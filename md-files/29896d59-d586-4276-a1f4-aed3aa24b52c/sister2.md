# Test Information

Loading...

The **Power Round** is a 80-minute exam focused on proof-writing.
The content of the test focuses on a single subject matter that is usually
significantly different from traditional competitive math problems.

The **Team Round** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short
answer questions.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute individual exam
consisting of 25 short answer questions that is designed for students that
have less specialized mathematical background.
  
*The General Test is worth 60% of the Subject Tests*.

The **Subject Tests** are two 50-minute individual exams
consisting of 10 short answer questions. The subjects offered are
**Algebra, Calculus, Discrete (Number Theory & Combinatorics), and
Geometry**

The **Guts Round** is an 80 minute live-scored team exam consisting
of 9 series of 3 questions each, whereby teams must submit answers to a previous
round in order to gain access to the next. Subsequent rounds are both harder
and worth more points than previous rounds.

  

# Anti-Cheating Measures

This year, SMT Online is implementing additional anti-cheating measures to
ensure a fair competition. These measures include, but are not limited to:

* **Zoom Breakout Rooms:** During tests, participants will be
  in Zoom breakout rooms, and they must have both screen sharing and their
  video cameras on at all times.
* If your device does not have a video camera, please let us know in
  advance. You also must record yourself with the second camera, described
  below.
* **Scratch Work Submissions:** Students will be required to
  submit their scratch work after the completion of each test. This scratch
  work should make the student's thought process for each problem reasonably clear.
* **Post-tournament review:** After the tournament, students and
  teams flagged as suspicious will be reviewed for potential cheating.

During and after tournament day, SMT will look for patterns of suspicious
behavior. If substantial evidence suggests that a participant may have
cheated, they will be disqualified **unless** they can provide
recording(s) that satisfy the following requirements:

* The participant's screen and hands are visible for the full period of
  the test. This applies to **all** test-taking sessions.
* Each round must be contained in **one** continuous recording.
  Separate rounds may have their own recordings.
* All rounds must be recorded.

Affected participants will be contacted by Wednesday, April 16, and must
submit satisfactory recordings within 48 hours.

Furthermore, if SMT has strong evidence that cheating occurred
systematically throughout a team, then that team will be prohibited from
participating in any SMT events for one year.

# FAQ

Q: How many students may be on a team?

A: Teams consist of 6-8 members. Individuals and incomplete teams may be combined by organizers to form complete teams.

Q: Do students on the same team have to be from the same school or established mathematical organization?

A: No, you are free to form teams from outside of your school/in your area.

Q: Can I register for SMT 2025 Online as an individual?

A: Yes, you can register as an individual.

Q: What schools or organizations can participate in SMT?

A: SMT 2025 Online will be open to all schools and organizations.

Q: Can international teams participate in SMT Online? If so, how do they register?

A: Yes, as long as they are able to take the tests in PDT time.

Q: Will SMT Online have Awards?

A: There are no physical awards, but we will be announcing results and providing digital certificates of achievement. These digital certificates will be provided within 2 weeks of the tournament.

Q: Are calculators allowed?

A: No. Calculators are not allowed on any portion of the tests. Check the SMT rules for information on permitted items.

Q: What topics may appear on the tests? How hard are the tests?

A: See the mathematical expectations document for guidelines on what topics may appear on each test. It is also advisable to look at the test from previous years in order to get a sense of the typical style and difficulty of SMT tests.

Q: Which individual test should I take?

A: If you have little or no experience with contest math, we strongly recommend you take the General Test. Looking at past tests will help you get a sense of the difficulty of each test.

Q: Can I use the problems from previous SMT tests listed below in my classroom/book/etc?

A: Yes! Feel free to use these problems provided you cite us in the format (Stanford Math Tournament [Year] [Round] [Problem #])
