# Admissions & Aid

Penn is committed to making its inclusive, innovative, and impactful Ivy League education available to the best and brightest students, regardless of their economic circumstances. A generous financial aid budget and inclusive aid policies make matriculating at Penn an attainable goal for students from the widest possible range of backgrounds. Every day, Penn embodies this truth: Our unique perspectives and backgrounds brought together make us strong, resilient, and singularly prepared to define the future.

## Applying to Penn

The college application process is a meaningful journey that encourages students to reflect on themselves, their community, and their interests. Your voice matters, and we can’t wait to hear your story.

### [Undergraduate Admissions](https://admissions.upenn.edu/)

When applying to Penn, undergraduates are asked to choose one of the University’s four undergraduate schools (the College, Wharton, Penn Engineering, or Penn Nursing), or a coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, or specialized program that will serve as home base throughout their academic journey. All admitted students will be admitted to the specific school or program for which they applied.

### [Preparing for First-Year Admission](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/apply-for-admission/first-year-admission)

Penn accepts the Common Application and Coalition Application. There is no preference for either format and both applications are treated equally in Penn’s process. Penn is also a proud QuestBridge partner institution.

### [Preparing for Transfer Admission](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/apply-for-admission/prepare-transfer-admission)

As with first-year admissions, the Common Application and Coalition Application are accepted for those wishing to transfer to Penn, and the use of the following resources are encouraged: Checklist and Deadlines, Curricular Requirements, Eligibility Guidelines, Transfer Credit.

### [Graduate Admissions](https://provost.upenn.edu/graduate-admissions)

Penn’s graduate and professional programs are housed in 12 schools on one campus. Each graduate program has a separate admissions process. Applicants apply directly to the program of interest. All questions about the admissions process should be directed to the program of interest.

## Need-based Grant Recipients

The cornerstone of Penn’s initiative to increase access for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds is its grant-based financial aid program. Since 2004, the University has awarded $4.3 billion in undergraduate aid to more than 30,000 students. Forty-six percent of traditional undergraduate students received grant-based financial aid in 2023-24. Ongoing gifts from generous alumni and supporters are expanding Penn’s robust undergraduate grant-based financial aid program and growing graduate and professional student aid to minimize the burden of debt.
