# J'COB College Experience Summer Program

The J’COB College Experience Summer Program at Ohio University’s College of Business is a transformative, week-long residential opportunity for rising high school seniors. Designed to inspire the next generation of business leaders, this competitive program combines experiential learning, teamwork, and campus immersion.

J’COB stands for Junior Executives in the College of Business and represents a five-year journey through the College of Business. The summer program serves as YEAR ZERO, giving students an early introduction to college life, leadership development, and creative problem-solving. For those who choose to attend Ohio University, J’COB continues with unique programming and support across their four undergraduate years, ensuring a transformative university experience that prepares them to thrive academically, professionally, and personally.

Throughout the summer program, students are introduced to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and develop creative problem-solving skills that prepare them to tackle complex global issues. The program culminates in a high-energy hackathon, where participants present innovative business solutions to real-world challenges before a panel of faculty, industry professionals, and community leaders.

In addition to academic workshops and team challenges, students experience life at Ohio University by living on campus, networking with professors and professionals, and connecting with peers from across the region. J’COB equips participants with the skills, confidence, and insights needed to make informed decisions about their future academic studies and career pathways in business, sports management, or entrepreneurship.

By the end of the program, students leave with more than memories—they gain tools to lead, create, and make a difference in their communities and beyond.
