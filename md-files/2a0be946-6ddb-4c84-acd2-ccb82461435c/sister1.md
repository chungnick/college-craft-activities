# Admission Requirements

## Undergraduate Program Admission Criteria

The College of Business welcomes and celebrates students with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and thoughts. The College of Business offers undergraduate degrees through the Athens campus and regional campuses.

### Athens Campus—First Year

As a selective program, the [College of Business](/business/about "About the College of Business") uses a holistic process to determine direct admission eligibility to the College of Business. Successful applicants typically present:

* An overall GPA of 3.0 or better on high school coursework
* Solid performance on a [strong college preparatory curriculum](https://www.ohio.edu/admissions/ohio-admission-promise#curriculum)
* Evidence of leadership and/or engagement during high school, such as participation in extracurricular activities, community service, work experience, or caregiving responsibilities. (Applicants will not be penalized for limitations on activities during COVID-19, of course.)

Through the [OHIO Admission Promise](https://www.ohio.edu/admissions/ohio-admission-promise), qualifying fall 2021 applicants will receive at least a renewable $2,000 OHIO Admission Promise Award when the FAFSA is completed on time.

First-year students not directly admitted to the College of Business but who are eligible for admission to the University will be admitted to University College as “Intending Business” and may transfer to the College of Business after completing certain [requirements](/business/resources/future-students/transfer-students "Transfer Students").

Through the [OHIO Guarantee+](https://www.ohio.edu/guarantee), first-year applicants directly admitted into the College of Business are guaranteed fixed tuition and fees for 12 consecutive semesters, an on-time graduation plan, and lifelong benefits.

[Freshman / First-Year Application](https://www.ohio.edu/admissions/apply#freshman)

### Athens Campus—Transfer

The College of Business welcomes transfer applicants who have completed more than nine semester hours (12 quarter hours) at another institution after graduating from high school. Through the [Ohio Transfer to Degree Guarantee in Business [PDF]](https://www.ohiohighered.org/sites/ohiohighered.org/files/uploads/transfer/pathways/OGTP_Business_Official_2.pdf), the College of Business works with transfer students to maximize general education and pre-major coursework transferability.
