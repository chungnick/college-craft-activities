## Program Information

Established in 1984 as an outreach program for local high school students, the Simons
Summer Research program now attracts applicants from all across the country to the
Stony Brook campus: Simons Fellows are matched with Stony Brook faculty mentors, join
a research group or team, and assume responsibility for a project. The Simons Fellows
conclude their apprenticeship by producing a written research abstract and a research
poster.   
  
In addition to learning valuable techniques and experiencing life at a major research
university, Simons Fellows attend weekly faculty research talks and participate in
special workshops, tours and events. At the closing poster symposium, students are
presented with a stipend award.

The Simons Summer Research Program is supported by the Simons Foundation.  
\*Students apply while they are currently in their junior year of high school (11th
grade)- and participate in the program in the summer before senior year.

**Eligibility**

Students interested in science who have demonstrated independence, creativity and
an aptitude for doing hands-on work are especially encouraged to apply.  
  
Applicants must currently be in their **junior year (11th grade) of high school at the time of applying**; must be US citizens and/or permanent residents; and must be at least 16 years of age by the start of the program.
