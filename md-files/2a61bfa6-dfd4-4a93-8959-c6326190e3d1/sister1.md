APPLICANT-FAQ

* If I have not been nominated by a high school official, am I still eligible to apply
  to the Simons program?

  It is up to each school to determine their selection process (lottery, first-come/
  first-serve, pre-application ) in choosing two (2) designated nominees.***Schools that exceed the two (2) student nomination limit, as well as independently
  submitted, late, and incomplete applications may be disqualified.***
* My high school is not listed on the database of high school contacts published on
  the website. Am I still eligible to apply? How can my school be added to the list?

  Yes. Schools that have not previously nominated a student in prior years will not
  appear on our current database. Should that be the case,  any school official (typically a science teacher, a science research coordinator) may nominate students
  for the Simons program by completing the nomination form and we will include that
  information on our database in future years.***It is strongly recommended that only one (1) school official be in charge of the nomination
  process to ensure there are no more than two (2) nominees from each school.***
* Are there any exceptions to the applicant eligiblity requirements/criteria?

  No. All applicants must *currently*be in their junior year (11th grade) of high school at the time of applying; must
  be US citizens and/or permanent residents; and must be at least 16 years of age by
  the start of the program.
* I have been living in the U.S. on a VISA for several years but do not have a permanent
  resident/green card. Am I eligible to apply?

  No. If admitted into the Simons program, all participants will need to provide documentation/proof
  of being a US citizen or holding a valid/current permanent/resident card. There are
  no expections to this requirement.
* I am currently 16 years old, a sophomore in high school, and taking accelerated/advanced
  honors courses. Am I eligible to apply to the Simons program?

  No. All applicants must currently be in their third year of high school (11th grade)
  at the time of application. There are no expections to this requirement.
* When is the application deadline for students?

  The deadline for students to apply to the Simons SRP program is: **THURS****DAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2026**  **@ 11:59 PM (EST)**.  We are unable to receive and consider materials submitted after the deadline. Teacher
  recommendations should be submitted by FEBRUARY 13, 2026.
* In addition to the required application materials, may I submit additional supplemental
  materials with my application?

  A completed application comprises: 1) online application; 2) student transcript (uploaded
  with online application); 3) two letters of recommendation from teachers (math/science
  preferred); and 4) school nomination from desginated high school official.  Applicants
  who have prior research experience may also request a third letter of recommendation
  from a previous faculty mentor.

  **Please do not attempt to send any other supplementary materials** (test scores, resumes, awards)that are not requested as we are unable to include these materials with application
  files.
* I am interested in applying to the Simons program and working with a prospective faculty
  mentor that is not indicated on the listing of Research Mentors. Am I still able to
  apply to work under their mentorship?

  Applicants may select their top three faculty mentor preferences on their online application.
  We cannot accommodate requests  to work with mentors not on the published list.  Students
  who are interested in independent research (outside the SSRP program) should not be
  discouraged from contacting faculty directly and making their own arrangements.
* Is it advantageous to contact a prospective faculty research mentor during the application
  process to increase my chances of acceptance into the Simons program?

  Contacting and reaching out to potential faculty mentors is not essential during the
  application process. Many faculty mentors are extremely busy with other obligations
  and often are unable to respond to individual applicant inquiries.  Applicants in
  some cases may be contacted by Simons SRP staff or potential faculty mentors as part
  of the application process.
* How will I know if my application is complete? When and how will I be notified and
  informed of the admissions decision?

  Applicants will be notified when letters of recommendation are submitted.  Teachers
  who submit a letter of recommendation on behalf of an applicant will receive an automated
  response confirming submission of their letter of recommendation.  (It is recommended
  that both applicants and teachers check spam email folders, as sometimes these confirmation
  messages are filtered  there.)

  All applicants will be notified of their admissionsdecision in early April.  The Simons program is unable to release early admissions
  decisions. Applicants who receive offers from programs at other institutions and need
  to commit are encouraged to take advantage of those opportunities. Applicantswho wish to withdraw their application/admissions candidacy should contact [simonssrp@stonybrook.edu](mailto:simonssrp@stonybrook.edu).
* Are there any tuition fees for students admitted into the Simons program?

  There are no tuition charges/fees; however participants are responsible for their
  own transportation/dining costs (commuters) and/or residential costs (if dorming on
  campus).
* What additional requirements are needed for research participants (once admitted to
  the program)?

  Upon admission, the program will require proof of medical insurance coverage, waivers
  regarding liability, emergency contact forms, etc. from the applicant and their parent
  or guardian.
* I have not been accepted into the Simons Summer Research Program. Am I able to request
  individual feedback on my application?

  All admissions decisions are final. Please note that admissions into the Simons program
  is highly selective and we receive far more applications from extremely talented qualified
  students than we can accommodate in the program. **Due to the extremely large number of applications received, the Simons program cannot
  provide individualized feedback to applicants.**
* What if I am not accepted to the Simons Research program but have already arranged
  to work for a specific mentor?

  There are many wonderful mentors for High School Researchers outside of the SSRP program
  at Stony Brook University. These arrangements  are made by mutual agreement between
  students and faculty mentors, are contingent upon University guidelines, and may require
  additional paperwork (to be coordinated by the mentor's department) . Additionally,
  we suggest that applicants seek out alternate research and science education programs
  offered at Stony Brook University and elsewhere.

  **The Simons Summer Research Program is very competitive and applicants should not be
  discouraged from pursuing research by other means.**

ADMITTED STUDENT - FAQ

* What do I need to do BEFORE the Simons program begins?

  Once you've been accepted into the Simons Summer Research program and received the
  name of your research supervisor, we encourage you to contact your mentor directly
  and ask for recommendations regarding papers you might read to get a sense of the
  lab's goals and ongoing research projects. Find out who will be your other colleagues
  (undergrad and grad students, post docs) in the lab/research group. Lab safety sessions
  (required) will be arranged for Simons Fellows in the first week of the program.
* Are all Simons Fellows encouraged/expected to compete in national science competitions?

  A Simons Program research project is subject to time constraints and will not generally
  satisfy the more comprehensive eligibility requirements for submissions to science
  fairs/competitions (e.g. ISEF, Regeneron STS, etc.) unless considerable follow-up
  work is done on the research project by mutual agreement with their university faculty
  mentor. Students interested in participating in national science competitions are encouraged
  to communicate their goals prior to starting in the program.
* What about ID cards? other paperwork?

  All Simons SRP Fellows conducting research will receive information on the first day
  of the program regarding the summer schedule and overall program expectations, as
  well as practical information.  In order to process this award, all program participants
  will need to complete and submit the necessary paperwork which will be sent to admitted
  students at later date.
* What does the day to day schedule look like?

  All Simons Fellows will receive information on weekly events and programming. All
  participants in the Simons program should expect to commit a minimum of 4 hours per day working on their own and/or with their mentor/research group. Hours
  may vary and should be agreed upon by consultation with the assigned faculty mentor.
  We cannot accommodate remote research placements.
* I have been accepted into the program. How do I get to STONY BROOK? If I am driving,
  where can I park on campus?

  Stony Brook University is easy to reach by air, car, ferry and rail. For directions
  to SBU, please click [here.](/sb/directions.shtml)

  Accepted students who plan to commute on a regular basis should consult the Stony
  Brook University website to find about [where to park](/commcms/mobility-and-parking/parking/Parking_Where_To_Park.php)/how to obtain a commuter parking permit.
