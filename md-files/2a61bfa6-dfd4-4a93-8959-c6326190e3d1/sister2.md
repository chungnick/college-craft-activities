## How to Apply

**Dates of Program: June 29 - August 7, 2026**

**Guide to applying:**

* ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

  Applicants must currently be in their junior year (11th grade) of high school at the
  time of applying; must be US citizens and/or permanent residents; and must be at least
  16 years of age by the start of the program. (No exceptions.)
* NOMINATION REQUIREMENTS

  **NOMINATION REQUIREMENTS:** Interested eligible applicants should seek nomination from their high school. The
  designated school nominator/official (typically a science research coordinator/director,
  guidance counselor or other appropriate contact in the high school) may have additional
  guidelines/processes for selecting the student nominees from the school. **We  recommend that only one official at each school** (for ex., one science teacher, or guidance counselor) **be responsible for nominating** students to ensure there are no more than 2 nominees per school (more than 2 nominees
  will result in the disqualification of all applicants).

  If you are not certain of the school official/contact handling nominations for your
  high school (usually a School Research Coordinator, Science Teacher, Guidance Officer),
  please view our database of high school contacts below:

  **LINK:** [**HIGH** **SCHOOL NOMINATION CONTACT LIST - SIMONS SRP**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-NDQjVGjSfMPQnbkCO9LA7tUoxL7Nl5IwKwSiNpssuwUs_zbjkLcWv2QTkN_Y0gLDoGtuDVAjpy6K/pubhtml "High School Contacts")

  Should the listings on the above database need to be modified, please ask the newly
  designated  HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIAL to contact us at [simonssrp@stonybrook.edu](mailto:simonssrp@stonybrook.edu)with their information (full name, position, contact information & school name/address)
  so we may update our directory.

  Schools not represented on this list have likely not previously nominated applicants
  for the Simons SSRP. If an individual school is not listed on our database and would
  like to nominate a student, the school official whom will be coordinating the nomination
  process should complete the nomination form. We can then add the school/representative
  to our directory as the main contact for future years.  
    
  **\*School nomination deadline:  January 30, 2026**
* ONLINE APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS

  **Note to applicants: Once you have confirmed your nomination status with the designated school official at your school,  you may

  materials (resume, test scores, research publications) that are not requested.**
* SELECTION PROCESS

  The Simons Summer Research Program is a national, competitive summer research program
  for 11th grade students. Prior research experience is not a prerequisite for the program.

  Applicants must indicate a preferred mentor/area of research interest. Additional
  admissions procedures (including interviews, by telephone or in person) may be required
  for placement within certain research groups/labs.  Note that obtaining an interview
  is not an indication of acceptance into the Simons program, and the program receives
  far more applications from qualified students than can be accommodated.
* IMPORTANT DATES

  January 30, 2026 - deadline for school nominations

  February 5, 2026 - deadline for  application submission

  February 13,  2026 - deadline for teacher recommendations

  **early April 2026**- notification of admissions decision to applicants (via email)
* PARTICIPATION Requirements

  All participants in the Simons program should expect to commit a minimum of 4 hours per day working with their mentor/research group for the full duration of the program. Hours may vary
  and should be agreed upon by consultation with the assigned faculty mentor.  
    
  Students admitted will be required to provide proof of medical insurance, waivers regarding liability, permission for
  use of photographs, etc. from the applicant and/or their parent/guardian. Further
  details will be provided to accepted students at a later date.

**Due to the large volume of applications received for this program, late submissions/materials
are not considered/accepted.**

---

**Percentage of students admitted:**  
***about <5%***

**Please note that admissions into the Simons program is highly selective and we receive
far more applications from qualified students than we can accommodate.**

So we can respond to all inquiries in a timely and efficient manner,  please contact
us via email   
at [simonssrp@stonybrook.edu](mailto:simonssrp@stonybrook.edu)if possible.
