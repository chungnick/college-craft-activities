# Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I enroll in summer classes?**

Our website explains the process for [UVA students](https://summer.virginia.edu/for-uva-students), [visiting and international students](https://summer.virginia.edu/for-visiting-students), and [high school students](https://summer.virginia.edu/for-high-school-students).

What do the instruction modes mean?

According to the [Undergraduate Record](https://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid=67&navoid=5925#course_instruction_mode), the *instruction mode* indicates how a course will be delivered.

**In Person (P) -**All instruction occurs on specific days/times and in a specific physical location. Instruction is not available remotely.

**In Person with Remote Option** **(PR)** - All instruction occurs on specific days/times and in a specific physical location. Instruction is available remotely.

**Hybrid (HY)**- Some instruction occurs on specific days/times and in a specific physical location. The remainder of instruction is delivered virtually, either synchronously or asynchronously. All in-person instruction is not available remotely.

**Hybrid with Remote Option (HR)** - Some instruction occurs on specific days/times and in a specific physical location. The remainder of instruction is delivered virtually, either synchronously or asynchronously. All in-person instruction is available remotely.

**Online Synchronous (OS)** - All instruction is delivered virtually and at least one class meeting (including exams) is scheduled at a specific day/time.

**Online Asynchronous (OA)** - All instruction is delivered virtually and no class meetings (including exams) are scheduled at a specified day/time (instructors may establish reasonable deadlines for coursework and exams).

**Where can I find tuition and fee information?**

The [Tuition & Fees](https://summer.virginia.edu/tuition-fees) section of the website discusses in-state and out-of-state tuition as well as the comprehensive fee.

**Is there financial aid available for Summer Session?**

Financial aid for summer is available for eligible undergraduate students currently enrolled in a degree program at the University of Virginia. Please note that grant funding for Summer Session is extremely limited and is need-based. Visit [Summer Session Financial Aid | Student Financial Services](https://sfs.virginia.edu/financial-aid-current-students/current-undergraduate-students/summer-session-financial-aid) for more information.

What is the attendance policy?

Students enrolled in a UVA Summer Session course are expected to **attend each class meeting.** Course requirements such as examinations, oral presentations, laboratory experiments, participation in discussion, or the like are in no sense waived because of absence from class. Instructors may establish penalties for an absence.

> **Unlike during fall and spring semesters, failure to attend summer classes does NOT automatically drop a student from the class.**

According to the [Undergraduate Record](https://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid=61&navoid=5217#atte_in_clas), a student who is making no real progress in a course, or whose behavior is detracting from the course, may be excluded from that course by the instructor with a grade of W or F. Students have 48 hours following written notification of this exclusion in which to appeal. The appeal should be made in writing to the [Director of the Office for Summer and Special Academic Programs](/staff). Until the final disposition of the appeal, the student will continue to be enrolled in the course and may continue to attend classes with the approval of the Director of Summer and Special Academic Programs and the instructor.

Students may not attend classes in which they are not enrolled, nor may they bring guests to classes in which they are enrolled, without the permission of the instructor.

**How do I register for a class after the first day?**

Email [summer@virginia.edu](mailto:summer@virginia.edu) with the course number and title and attach written permission from the instructor to add the course.

**When is the last day to drop? What is the withdrawal period?**

Check the [Dates and Schedules](https://summer.virginia.edu/calendars) page for add, drop, and withdrawal information.

**What is the refund policy for dropping a course?**

Check the [Dates and Schedules](https://summer.virginia.edu/calendars) page for the refund schedule.

**How do I change my grading option?**

Students can change their grading option through the first day of their class by using Edit Enrollment in SIS.Students who wish to change their grading option after day one of their class may do so with the permission of their instructor through the mid-point of their class by completing a [Course Action Form](https://na2.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=739e3eba-5f7a-459a-82ae-23c004a9c624&env=na2&acct=c8f5349d-70fd-4ca1-84d8-241df643bf22&v=2). After your instructor approves the form, it will go directly to the Summer Session Student Records Coordinator to process. You may verify that the action was taken by checking your SIS account.

**How can I request a course syllabus?**

Email the instructor teaching the class and ask for a copy. Summer Session does not have access to syllabi.
