The Summer Math Program for Young Scholars Program at NYU’s Center for Mathematical Talent is an intensive in-person 3-week long summer course for high school students, grades 9-11. The program provides a mathematically rich environment to students interested in math, and is designed to help them explore and navigate academic and professional careers in the mathematical sciences.

Through classes and collaborative and independent course work, students explore college-level mathematical concepts, including number theory, graph theory, topology and computer science. Accelerate your math skills this summer, prepare for college, and connect with students from around the world at NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

## How to Apply

Eligible applicants will be high school students currently enrolled in grades 9, 10, or 11 who have a demonstrated interest in mathematics and a good academic standing (math grades B- or higher).

To apply, fill out the online Summer Math Program for Young Scholars Application Creation Form. On this form, you will be asked to provide some basic information such as name, date of birth, and email, in order to create their account in our application system.

Once you submit the application form, you will receive an email with a temporary PIN and instructions for finalizing your account setup. Once your account is set up, you will login to complete the application, which includes a short essay response, and uploads of your high school transcript and a letter of recommendation.

## Areas of Study

* Number Theory
* Graph Theory
* Topology
* Combinatorics
* Computer Science

## Student Life

Students attend lectures led by Courant faculty and graduate students, followed by problem sessions during which students work collaboratively in groups to tackle math problems related to the lecture.

Each week, students participate in a mathematical games and puzzle-solving session, during which they can apply the theories they’ve learned and develop their skills in problem solving. At the end of each day, faculty and guest speakers give talks on topics that focus on how math is used in a wide range of scientific and other professional fields. Topics also include the college admissions process and transitioning to college life to help students prepare for the next big step on their academic journey.

Students also spend a day on a group field trip to the  National Museum of Mathematics in New York City.

The Summer Math Program for Young Scholars is a commuter program and does not offer on-campus housing to students.

## FAQs

Do students receive grades or credits?

The students do not receive course grades or academic credit for participating in the Summer Math Program for Young Scholars. It is a pass/fail program. After the program ends, students who pass will be given a certificate of completion and have the opportunity to request a non-credit transcript from NYU.

Does this program accept international students?

Not at this time. NYU offers other programs for High School students that do admit international students. Please visit our website for other options.

I'm having trouble with the Online Application. Who can I contact for help?

Please email [university.programs@nyu.edu](mailto:university.programs@nyu.edu) with a description of the issue you are having that includes the name of the student and their application number. If it’s a technical issue or you are receiving an error message, please include a screenshot of the error message.

Do I have to wait for teacher recommendations to be submitted before I submit the online application?

No. The first, most important step is to submit your online application. In the application, there is an opportunity to identify a recommender and email them about submitting a recommendation. After this, the student should complete and submit the online application. Your recommender may submit a recommendation before or after you submit your online application. Once a recommender submits the recommendation, it will be linked to your application which will then be marked as complete. Once an application is complete, an email will be sent to the student’s personal email address.
