## Testimonials

### Yonathan Kiflezghie

> Year in Program: 2024  
>   
> Applying to be a part of the Neurocamps 2024 cohort has been one of the best decisions that I have made. My goal for the next 5 years is to attend a university studying neuroscience, and being part of the UCLA Neurocamp has made it very tangible. Over the course of 2 weeks, my peers and I were introduced to the fundamental concepts of neuroscience and basic lab techniques in molecular neurobiology, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy. Being in an environment where my peers are eager to learn was such a great experience because I could work with like-minded people who share my interests. Dr. Domingez and Dr. Grisham, our professors for the program, did an amazing job introducing us to the amazing field of neuroscience. Working alongside them and UCLA undergraduates, who volunteered as our helpers, put me one step closer to my goal for the next 5 years, and if I had the chance to participate in this program again, I would. At my high school, I don’t get the opportunity to work in a hands-on lab setting; however, being with the Neurocamp, most of my time was spent working on labs such as dissecting a sheep's brain and a cow's spinal cord, then studying the anatomy. I would like to thank the UCLA Brain Research Institute for this amazing opportunity to study and get introduced to the amazing field of neuroscience, as well as for allowing me to meet great people who made my time there special.

### Nathaniel Vasquez

> Year in program: 2024  
>   
> Learning about neuroanatomy, dissecting brains, and performing cutting-edge research. These were just a few of the fascinating experiences the 2024 Neurocamp cohort encountered during their two weeks at UCLA. From the moment I walked in to the second I walked out, I was learning. Throughout the first couple of days, I learned about the intricacies of brain structure and function from Dr. Elena Dominguez's captivating lectures, which delved into neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Best of all, however, I was able to apply my knowledge to hands-on brain and spinal cord dissections. In the following days, Dr. William Grisham familiarized the class with Dr. David Glanzman’s novel research on epigenetic changes in untrained Aplysia after being injected with RNA from trained Aplysia. After learning about his research, we conducted a similar experiment with earthworms and received some results that aligned with Dr. Glanzman’s pioneering work. It was truly a great feeling to be part of such a progressive field of research. Beyond the hands-on work and lectures, my connections with peers and professors were the most memorable. Being around people with similar interests and aspirations made my love for neuroscience even more profound; however, meeting Dr. Dominguez was paramount to my experiences at Neurocamp. With great interest in computational neuroscience but little guidance, I felt lost; however, Dr. Dominguez patiently answered my questions regarding a paper I was reading and thoughtfully recommended online resources to help me further my research on the topic. Neruocamp is not only a place to learn but also a place to connect with others and deepen your interest in the vast range of neuroscience topics.

### Mason Gonzalez

> Year in program: 2024  
>   
> I believe that this experience is one that all people who are interested in neuroscience should partake in. I had a great experience learning about neuroscience and what it feels like to be a neuroscience student at UCLA. All of my instructors and assistants were some of the kindest people I’ve ever met, and they constantly guided me, making my experience so much more enjoyable.  If I could, I would absolutely love to partake in this experience for years to come. Thank you to all of my fellow neuroscience campers for making my experience so memorable. But most importantly, thank you to all at the UCLA Brain Research Institute for this wonderful opportunity and for helping pave the way for my future education and career.

### Lisa Nguyen

> Year in program: 2019  
>   
> At the UCLA Neurocamp, I learned a lot about how the brain works, along with the diseases. I also did a lot of hands on labs, to see if the sample I had carried the Huntington Disease. I have learned more about this concept than in AP Biology. I am looking to do more research like this in the future. What inspired me to learn about neuroscience is my curiosity for how the brain works. Everyone’s brain works differently, and I was willing to learn more about that.

### Parth Amin

> Year in program: 2019  
>   
> I was able to get my hands dirty with wet work, particularly through investigating c-elegan habituations. After observing their responses to air puffs, our lab was able to observe the phenomenon of neural plasticity within the simple nematodes. I was also able to further my understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal firing, brain anatomy, and the process of PCR with my lab section. I like to thank Dr. Grisham for allowing me to work with him and his wonderful team. I find neural plasticity and brain development very fascinating. I was intrigued to learn more about the neuronal pruning that results with age, and the molecular mechanisms that facilitate neuronal signal strengths. I was pleasantly surprised that my childhood video game character, Sonic Hedgehog, plays a critical role in the development of the human brain.

### Monica Amirian

> Year in program: 2019  
>   
> During the two-week summer program at UCLA Neurocamp, I was introduced to concepts of neuroscience and basic lab techniques in Molecular Neurobiology and Neurophysiology. In high school, I never got to work in a lab setting and learn about all the tools that can be used which is why I applied to Neurocamp because it is a great program to show high school students who are interested in doing research one day about labs. One of my biggest accomplishments during this program was getting to master how to use a pipette in an experiment with mice ears to figure out which one of the ears was contaminated with a disease. We also got to experiment with crickets who were injected with caffeine to see the differences in their reactivity. However, one of my favorite parts about the program was meeting new people who I still to this day keep in touch with through social media. The mystery about all the diseases in neurology is what inspires me to learn about neuroscience. The brain is a complex organ that contains all our memories, histories, and emotions that has so much to be explored and most of it has not been discovered yet. The field of neuroscience always has a challenge and obstacle ahead of you which keeps your everyday learning interesting.
