The UCLA Brain Research Institute co-ordinates a large portion of neuroscience educational programs on campus. It is home to the [Interdepartmental Ph.D. Program for Neuroscience (G-NSIDP)](https://medschool.ucla.edu/research/uclas-competitive-research-training-grant-programs), with endowment support for the program. The NSIDP is one of seven [Graduate Programs in Biosciences](http://bioscience.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. The goal of this program is to train students to be conversant in all levels of analysis used in neuroscience, from the molecular and cellular to the system levels, while specializing in their chosen field of research. Currently the Neuroscience Graduate IDP comprises approximately 80 doctoral students. On average, 12 new students enter the program every year.

Specifically, the BRI administratively supports NSIDP program leadership, recruitment, admissions, curriculum, coordinates the Achievement Rewards for College Students fellowship program, and organizes in course development, course assessment, course coordination, TA selection, student evaluation, student advising, student financial aid, mentor evaluation, faculty membership, website, publications, and the annual Neuroscience Interdepartmental Ph.D. Program Retreat

In its capacity as administrative home for the [Undergraduate Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program](http://www.neurosci.ucla.edu/), the BRI provides oversight of program staffing, administrative and IT support, and financial support for selected undergraduate activities. This program currently encompasses over 700 undergraduate neuroscience majors.

Postdoctoral research instruction is another major activity of the BRI. Over 250 postdoctoral students holding PhD, MD, DDS or DVM degrees occupy BRI members’ laboratories.

The institute also administers and/or financially supports a number of [neuroscience related training grants](https://bri.ucla.edu/training-grants/) (NIH T32) with pre- and post-doctoral positions:

* Training Grant in Neurobehavioral Genetics [T32NS048004](http://reporter.nih.gov/quicksearch/T32NS048004) Carrie Bearden and Roel Ophoff.
* Training in Neurotechnology Translation [T32NS115753](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/N5LoAu1-d0WjrpqpA3QkTA/projects), Nanthia Suthana
* Translational Neuroscience of Drug Abuse [T32DA024635](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/yNSfC_pBFkaHRXWpukGRpQ/projects) Edythe London
* Brain and Behavioral Development during Adolescence [T32HD091059](http://reporter.nih.gov/quicksearch/T32HD091059) Andrew Fuglini
* Training the science of child mental health treatment [T32MH073517](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/XlGsLYU5wU-uE9Sk_P9w6w/projects) Jim McCracken
* Vision Science Training Program [T32EY007023](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ALjOahLhgEeYtGmqsSuFrw/projects) Alapakkam Sampath
* Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) [T32GM008042](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/CraJVT-hp0Cb4nzn5JdSfA/projects) Carlos Portera-Cailliau

As part of its outreach mission, the BRI is also active in a number of [K-12 education](https://bri.ucla.edu/k-12-education-and-outreach-programs/) programs, aiming to extend scientific knowledge into the community and inspire elementary and secondary school students to explore a career in neuroscience.
