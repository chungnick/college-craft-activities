# Cellular Construction Workshop

* [Overview](#overview)

##### With support from the NSF, SEP led the CCW Program that ran from 2017 until the Summer of 2025

### Overview

**SEP’s high school programs are only open to students from SFUSD or SF charter schools**

The Cellular Construction Workshop was a 10-day summer workshop for high school teachers and students.  This NSF-funded program, as part of the [Center for Cellular Construction](http://www.centerforcellularconstruction.org), engages students and teachers in design challenges as they learn together about the field of cellular engineering.

Have you heard of cellular engineering? Cellular engineering is a field of biology that uses cells to solve complex problems. It applies what we know about cells, including how they’re built, make decisions, and accomplish tasks, to develop new technology based on this knowledge. We need a new generation of scientists to help us tinker, build, and figure out how things work so that we can use cellular engineering to make the world a better place — that’s why we need you!

The Cellular Construction Workshop (CCW)w as a paid 10-day long summer program where high school students and teachers work together to learn about the field of cellular engineering. Students and teachers collaborate in teams to conduct experiments to observe how cells work, use robots and coding to copy how cells make decisions, and try to solve a real-world problem using what they’ve learned about cells and coding. No coding or robotics knowledge is necessary!

### Learn how students enhance teacher learning:

Note about the above video: teacher nominations are no longer required, but instead a letter of recommendation. See the "How to Apply" section for more information.
