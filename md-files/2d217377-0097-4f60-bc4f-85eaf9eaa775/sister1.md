## Cellular Engineering

##### The vision of our center is to develop an engineering discipline that will allow us to design and build cells and tissue with specific three-dimensional structures. These structures will serve as living factories and building blocks for better and more sustainable products, materials, and devices to benefit humankind. Our mission is to launch a new approach to understanding and designing cells. In pursuit of this mission, we will revolutionize industry through novel cell-based approaches to produce chemicals and materials for medical, civil, and consumer applications; we will educate and train a diverse research and manufacturing workforce, and we will engage and inspire the public to embrace the promise of engineering cells to produce the materials and factories of tomorrow.
