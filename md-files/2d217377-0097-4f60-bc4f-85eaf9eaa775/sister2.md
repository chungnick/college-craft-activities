## Scientist Interview

Meet Tom Zimmerman, Master Inventor at IBM. In this short video he’ll explain his path to science and his struggles along the way. We hope this video gives you and your students a new perspective on how real science works via creativity and collaboration.

## Open Roberta

Open Roberta is a cloud-based programming language. It’s free to use and compatible with any internet-capable device (iPads, tablets, chromebooks, laptops, etc). Open Roberta also comes with a built-in robot SIM, allowing teachers to offer some of the above robotics lessons without purchasing LEGO robots.
