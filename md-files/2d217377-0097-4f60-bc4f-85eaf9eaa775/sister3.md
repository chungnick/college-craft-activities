##### The 2026 High School Intern Program begins Monday, June 8, 2026 and ends Friday, July 31, 2026.

##### **High School Intern Program In the News: [*Inside the UCSF Internship Program Inspiring the Scientists of Tomorrow*](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/08/428226/inside-ucsf-internship-program-inspiring-scientists-tomorrow)**

Most high school students spend their summers hanging out with friends, catching up on TV and working part-time jobs…..

## For rising seniors

**SEP’s high school programs are only open to students from SFUSD or SF charter schools. *We are not able to make exceptions to this criteria.***

##### HIP Program Overview

Through SEP’s High School Intern Program, high school students learn how to conduct biomedical research during an 8-week paid summer internship at UC San Francisco. Students are matched with a scientist mentor who guides their learning of science content and skills to complete a unique research project. Learn more below.

Each summer, high school students conduct original research under the direction of a UCSF scientist mentor. This is a rigorous and intense program with just eight weeks for students to complete and present their research projects. Unlike most other high school research programs in the country, acceptance into the High School Intern Program (HIP) is not contingent upon students’ grades, commitments to a career in science, or paths to college. We recruit and encourage students who are low-income and first generation to college to apply.

HIP seeks to support students’ growth and recognition of their own potential by engaging them with authentic science research projects, peer sharing and learning, and individual college counseling. HIP aims to help students develop a sense of belonging in order to broaden their ideas about their own place in college and careers in the biomedical sciences. In order to participate, a student must be a rising senior and attend an SFUSD high school or SF charter school.

Each year, 10 of our high school interns are supported with funding from the [California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/) as part of CIRM’s [Summer Program to Accelerate Regenerative Medicine Knowledge (SPARK)](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/our-impact/internship-programs). An additional 10 students are funded by the [NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/).

> “The connection I built with my mentor at the HIP encouraged me to pursue college level research and encouraged me to keep going although the field is intimidating.”   
>   
> “My thinking about college has switched because now I won't settle for less, lots of people see potential in me, so I must see the same potential"
>
> High School Interns

##### HIP Program Outcomes

A large majority of HIP alumni report that because of their participation in the program, their self-confidence increased, they realized they could be successful in college and STEM, and are interested in pursuing a career in STEM. 

HIP interns enroll in and graduate from college at rates that exceed national averages predicted by their parents’ educational attainment with 99% enrolling in either a 2- or 4-year institution in the fall following their high school graduation. As of December 2019, 71% of alumni, who were at least 6-years post-matriculation, had earned degrees or were currently enrolled in post-secondary education.

In recognition of HIP’s success, the program received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring in 2011. You can learn more about HIP and its longitudinal outcomes in this [2020 Journal of STEM Outreach article](https://sep.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/14509-fostering-pathways-30-years-of-inspiring-high-school-students-to-pursue-science-careers-through-biomedical-research-experiences.pdf).

HIP is one of SEP’s longest running programs and is currently funded by the UCSF Chancellor, School of Medicine and Executive Vice Chancellor, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the Baskin Family Foundation.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Who is eligible to apply?

Students who are current juniors, and are attending an SFUSD school or SF charter school.

When is the application due?

Sunday, February 8th by 11:59 pm

What do I need to include in my application?

A completed electronic application form.

How do I submit the application?

Submit all elements of your application using the link above.

How do you select students?

We read every application very carefully and use each component of the application to inform our decision. Through the application, tell us about why we should select you. ***We don’t use grades or academic achievement as an indicator of potential success in this program.*** Instead, we want to know that you have some interest in science and that this program could help make a difference in your life. The ideal candidate will show us:

* Evidence of maturity and responsibility
* Evidence of persistence through challenges
* Science interest
* Motivation to participate in this program

How many students do you interview and accept?

We typically interview 50 students for 25 available positions.

When will I know if I’m accepted into the program?

We will notify students via email in April.

If I’m accepted, do I get to choose which research project I do?

Generally no. Each summer, different scientists participate as mentors in the High School Intern Program. This means that we don’t usually know which research projects will be available until late spring. Ultimately, the program coordinators make final lab placement decisions based on student interest, schedules, lab locations, and other considerations.

What type of research will I be doing?

There is a wide variety of research our interns typically do, but you can check out a few past intern research projects [here](https://sep.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HIP-Past-projects.pdf)!

Can I participate in other summer programs if I do this one?

This is not advisable. Participation in this program includes working in the laboratory with your mentor, meetings with other interns and program staff, meetings with college counselors, and attending career talks. Though this is not a homework-heavy program, there will be assignments and other independent work required. If an applicant needs to participate in summer school, has extensive family obligations, or needs to work another job, these circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine acceptance into the program.

I don’t meet the eligibility criteria for this program. Are there other summer science programs for high school students that I can do?

Check out this [list](https://ucsf.box.com/s/xmjadsm4t77uyjakdrr26dlkabbit92h) we’ve put together!
