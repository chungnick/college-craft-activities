# Hear From Georgetown University

# What Our Students Are Saying

> "This psychology course was truly eye-opening, offering deep insights into how the mind works. The blend of theory and practical application made the lessons impactful, and the TA's support enhanced the overall experience. After completing this course, I feel equipped with a better understanding of psychology that I can apply in everyday life."

Susanna, college credit psychology student from Armenia

> "The content was interesting and engaging, the TA's were very kind and helpful, and overall a great introduction into college level science. The assignments were fun and creative, and having all the guests come on and discuss their expertise was really nice! The discussion of the past, present, and future of science felt unique to this course since it's not something that is typically taught and understood in a high school level class. I would really recommend to students with an interest in biology and who are ready for a challenging, yet exciting, class!"

Jillian, college credit biology student from Colo.
