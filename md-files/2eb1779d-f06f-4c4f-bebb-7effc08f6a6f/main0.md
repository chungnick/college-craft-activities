## What is Summer Stretch?

Summer Stretch offers both accelerated courses and courses for enrichment for students **currently in 7th through 10th grade.**

Summer Stretch provides highly motivated students with an intensive, hands-on, fun, and educational experience.

The 2026 Stretch program runs for four weeks, four days a week – Monday through Thursday – from 9:00 AM to 2:30 PM. Classes are held in person at the University of Washington Seattle campus. Classes are small and instructors are all specialists in their field.

Stretch will run from June 29 to July 23rd, 2026.\*
