### Program Information

The Stretch program offers students an opportunity to focus deeply on a single area of interest for four weeks. Whether you want to master essay writing, participate in a mock trial, or explore the world of mathematical thinking, Summer Stretch has you covered!

**The 2026 Stretch program will run from June 29th to July 23rd. Classes run Monday-Thursday from 9 am-2:30 pm.\***

\**Due to the FIFA World Cup, we will be adjusting our originally planned schedule to avoid in-person programming on game days. Check back in for details when courses are posted January 23rd.*

* [Lottery](https://robinsoncenter.uw.edu/programs/summer-programs/summer-stretch/apply/#1767053674720-f861b60a-151e) for Summer Stretch 2026 opens February 15th, 2026 at 4pm and closes February 28th at 4pm
* Families are strongly encouraged to ensure their child attends all 15 days of class to get the most out of their Summer Stretch experience.
* Students may arrive at their assigned classrooms between 8:50 and 9:00 AM. Attendance is taken at 9 AM.
* Families can report a student’s absence by emailing rcsummer@uw.edu or calling 206.543.4160.

**The Robinson Center does not grant high school credit for Stretch courses.** It is the decision of each individual school and district as to whether a Summer Stretch course qualifies for school credit/placement. If students would like school credit for their Summer Stretch course, they MUST obtain permission from their school counselor or principal in advance.

**Starting this year, the Before and  After-Care service is open to 7th-10th students.** Students may also use other public spaces on campus. [See this map for suggestions.](https://scout.uw.edu/seattle/study/?type0=open)

### Before-Class Care

Students may be dropped off at their classroom no earlier than 8:50 AM. For students who need to be dropped off earlier, we offer an option for supervised before-class care from 8:15 AM – 9:00 AM at the Robinson Center. Students will be escorted to their classes by teaching aides. A student must be accepted into a class before you can register for before-class care. There is no before-class care the first day of the program.

### After-Class Care

We also offer after-class care from 2:30 PM – 4:30 PM. We supervise all students and provide fun activities to keep them engaged. A student must be accepted into a class before you can register for after-class care. There is no after-class care on the final day of the program.
