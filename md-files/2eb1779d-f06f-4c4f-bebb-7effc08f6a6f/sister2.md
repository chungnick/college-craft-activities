#### **Tuition Waivers and Fee Waivers**

Tuition and fee waivers may be awarded to families who are eligible for the federal free or reduced school lunch program. We will give financial aid to all eligible families, on a first-come first-served basis, until our financial aid funds for Summer Stretch are exhausted.

The Seattle Public Schools website lists the federal income eligibility guidelines for free and reduced lunch [here](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/nutritionservices/free_and_reduced_price_meals).

To demonstrate eligibility for financial aid, you must submit ONE of the following:

* Documentation of eligibility for the free/reduced lunch program for the 2024-25 school year;
* Copy of the first page of your 2025 or 2026 1040-tax form showing your income;
* Evidence of current participation in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);
* Evidence of receipt of current Basic Food/SNAP benefits;
* Participation in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR);
* Documentation that the student is currently in the foster care system.

**NOTE:** We are not able to provide tuition assistance for students residing outside of Washington State.

Documents must be submitted through the ‘Make a Payment’ page of your Robinson Center account. Providing this information will not disadvantage you. Please note that when you apply for financial aid, you will be prompted to complete the release forms required for our program before you can upload your documentation.

Information supplied to the Robinson Center is intended for internal use only. It is understood that this information will be used only in computing the amount of financial assistance for which the student may qualify, and that it will not be released to any other party. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [rcsummer@uw.edu](mailto: rcsummer@uw.edu).
