# Overview

The Research Mentorship Program is a competitive summer program that engages qualified, high-achieving high school students from all over the world in interdisciplinary, hands-on, university-level research. Students will be paired with a mentor (graduate student, postdoc, or faculty) and choose a research project from a long list of disciplines offered by the program each year.

Along with their mentor, students will learn about research techniques, gain insight into professional research-based opportunities, and mature their academic goals. The [GRIT talks](https://www.uctv.tv/grit/ "GRIT Talks") lecture series will connect students to some of the best minds within the UC Santa Barbara research community as they present their ground-breaking research and innovative technology. Along with these academic benefits, students will be immersed in university life and network with equally ambitious and curious peers.

Check out the [2026 Pre-College Brochure](/sites/default/files/documents/PC/M26%20PC%20Brochure%20.pdf "2026 PC Brochure").

Students must attend the program in its entirety, from the virtual component to the closing events.

**Application Window:** December 15, 2025 – March 9, 2026  
Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis.
