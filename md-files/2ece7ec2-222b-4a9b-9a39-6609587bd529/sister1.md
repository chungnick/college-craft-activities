## Application Requirements

[Application](#collapse-457)

**The 2026 online application includes:**

* Transcript – You will be asked to upload a transcript that shows your entire high school academic history. You can ask your school or counselor for a copy of an unofficial transcript to submit with your application. **It must include the first trimester or semester grades for the 2025–2026 academic school year**. Quarter grades do not suffice for review. Transcripts will be checked and verified before applications are reviewed.
* AP Scores – If you have taken AP exams, you can upload a copy of your score report from the College Board. Please ensure the uploaded file contains your full name.
* Personal Statement – In a 500-word maximum essay, propose a process-based research question that reflects your goals and interests, share how you would go about investigating this problem, and explain why RMP is the ideal program to explore high-level research.
* Short Responses – This series of questions allows us to get to know you better. In 150 words or fewer for each response, we will ask you to answer the following prompts:

  + Tell us about an idea or experience that made you absolutely excited about learning or sparked a period of personal growth.
  + What does it mean to be an ethical researcher, and how would you apply these values to your work at RMP?
  + What skills do you hope to develop in RMP that will set you up for success in future opportunities?
  + Failure is a major component of research. Based on your past experiences, what are the potential barriers and setbacks you anticipate facing during your research journey at RMP, and how would you address them?

Recommendations **will not** be part of the 2026 RMP application review.
