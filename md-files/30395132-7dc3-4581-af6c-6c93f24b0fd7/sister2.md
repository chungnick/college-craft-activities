# Financial Aid

## Department Overview

### Our Mission

Swarthmore College’s commitment to financial aid and access is at the heart of our educational mission. We believe that every admitted student should have the opportunity to thrive here, regardless of their financial background. To put that into numbers. In 2025-26, 56% of our students received need-based financial aid, supported by a $65 million financial aid budget.

The Financial Aid Office's mission is to support students and families navigating the cost of a Swarthmore education by providing information, resources, and guidance. 

### Three Distinctive Commitments

1. **Swarthmore practices “need-blind” admissions:** This means that decisions about your admission to Swarthmore and your financial aid eligibility are made independently if you are a [U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or undocumented/DACA student  or in the aslyee/refugee status application process and graduating from a U.S. high school](/financial-aid/domestic-students).
2. **Swarthmore meets full need:** The College strives to make it possible for all admitted students to attend Swarthmore by meeting 100 percent of the [determined need](/financial-aid/how-do-we-determine-financial-need) for all eligible admitted students.
3. **Swarthmore’s aid is loan-free:** Our financial aid decisions consist of grants (which do not need to be repaid) and the opportunity for students to work in [part-time campus-based jobs](/student-employment). However, your family might choose to borrow a loan from the government, a private lending agency, or a bank to pay a portion of the expected family contribution — which will need to be repaid.

### Our Process

We understand that the financial aid process can feel challenging at times. You might have questions about what information is required, how the process works, and how your family’s unique situation might impact the outcome of an application for financial aid. This video breaks down the process into a helpful tutorial. And remember – our staff is here to help.

Please note that the video above explains the process for U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or undocumented/DACA students graduating from a U.S. high school. International applicants can find more information on our [international student aid page](/financial-aid/international-students).  
  
You can find more information about the financial aid process in our [Financial Aid Handbook](/sites/default/files/assets/documents/financial-aid/2526-Financial-Aid-Handbook-032025.pdf). 

### Holistic Application Review

Swarthmore follows a thorough and holistic financial aid application process. Each year, families must submit a complete financial aid application. This enables the Financial Aid Committee to make an informed decision on your family’s ability to pay for a Swarthmore education, based on your unique financial circumstances. We encourage you to contact our office if you would like to discuss your individual application or if you have general questions about how our financial aid application process works.
