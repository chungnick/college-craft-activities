Applications for VAMPY 2026 will open in January of 2026. Make sure to join our [Monthly Update email list](/gifted/interest/index.php) to keep up with all future happenings at The Center.

A three-week residential camp held in June and July, VAMPY offers high-ability **students who have completed grades 7–10** the chance to focus on one course during six class hours each weekday plus a nightly
hour-long study hall. Classes are taught by highly motivated WKU faculty and high
school teachers who are thrilled to have equally highly motivated students.

Students arrive at the WKU campus from counties around Kentucky, states across the
nation, and countries all over the world to form a community of diverse backgrounds
and interests. For gifted and talented students who crave knowledge, academic challenge,
and peers who accept them as they are, VAMPY offers a life-changing world of both
learning and friendship.

**Where Will They Stay?**  
Campers participate in evening and weekend activities and live on WKU's campus in
an air-conditioned residence hall under the supervision of camp counselors.

**Curriculum**  
The primary emphasis of VAMPY is academics. VAMPY’s rigorous educational environment
reminds students that learning is an enjoyable process as they spend three weeks immersed
in a topic of their choosing that ignites their curiosity. VAMPY classes are centered
on the students’ interests and consistently challenge them.

**What Else Can They Do at Camp?**When not in class, campers participate in a wide range of activities that bring them
together as a community. Ask students what the other campers are like, and they’ll
respond with answers like, “family,” “accepting,” and “universally kind.”

Many camp activities are created by their counselors, most of whom are college students
who attended VAMPY themselves. While they compete in Capture the Flag or make chalk
art during evening Optionals; attend cookouts, baseball games, or dances on the weekends;
or play endless card games with their hallmates, campers make friendships that can
last a lifetime. One such event campers may attend is seeing a show at the [Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center](https://www.theskypac.com/).

**Who Can Apply?**An ACT or SAT score is required for all VAMPY applicants. Students who have registered
to take the ACT or SAT by April 11 may apply to VAMPY and indicate their scores are
pending. Students in grades 7 and 8 should consider taking the ACT through the [Talent Identification Program of Kentucky (TIP-KY)](/gifted/tipky/act/index.php).
