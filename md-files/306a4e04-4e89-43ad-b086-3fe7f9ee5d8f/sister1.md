# Frequently Asked Questions about VAMPY

---

*All times CDT.*

What classes are taught at VAMPY?  
The overall course offerings change every summer, although some classes are taught
multiple years in a row. We always provide a diverse curriculum, including courses
in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and the humanities. A
list of the 2026 courses is provided on the application and can also be found [here](/gifted/vampy/courses.php) (if you are looking at this page in fall or winter, you will see a list of courses
from the previous year).

*For more on class content, see our [blog](https://gifted-studies.com/category/vampy/), including descriptions of what last year’s students did, as written by the course
teaching assistants.*

Who teaches VAMPY classes?Our teachers are WKU faculty and other outstanding educators who want to work with
high-interest and high-ability young people and understand how to create courses that
challenge and excite gifted and talented students. They are supported by teaching
assistants who are often undergraduate college students.  
 *For more on teaching, see our [blog](https://gifted-studies.com/category/vampy/), including the 2019 article [VAMPY TAs Do It All](http://gifted-studies.com/campblog/vampy-tas/).*

What is the class size?For an optimum teacher-student ratio, classes are capped at 16 students; some classes
will have fewer.

What makes VAMPY courses special for campers?*First, VAMPY classes allow students to discover, follow, and develop their academic
passions.* Teachers shape their courses around students’ interests rather than a required curriculum,
and spending three weeks in one academic area enables students to engage with a topic
at a breadth and depth not available during the regular school year. In addition,
rather than being motivated by grades, students are motivated by their desire to learn.

*Second, VAMPY creates a communal learning experience for teachers and students.* Surrounded by high-ability peers who want to learn, VAMPY students are exposed to
the experience of truly cooperative learning. There is no competition over grades
or class standing, and there is no worry about carrying the label of “the smart kid.”
Class discussions are enthusiastic and thoughtful, and students genuinely value each
other's viewpoints.

Does every class take field trips?Some classes build field trips into the schedule.

What is a typical day like for campers?On a typical weekday, campers make their way together to the Downing Student Union
(DSU) to eat breakfast around 8 a.m. They then walk to their class, which begins at
8:45 a.m. They go to lunch together at midday and return to class afterward. When
classes end at 4:15 p.m., they walk back to their residence hall to check in with
their counselors and have time at the residence hall before dinner. After dinner,
unless there is a special event, they choose from a wide range of Optionals (small
group activities run by the counselors that offer everything from Capture the Flag
to chalk art). On Sunday-Thursday, students also participate in study hall from 8-9
p.m., working under the guidance of their teaching assistants. The day ends with community
time, and lights out is around 10 p.m. Near the end of camp, campers attend and/or
participate in a talent show and enjoy a special dinner and dance.

On the weekends, campers eat and relax together, do laundry as needed, attend a worship
service if they choose, and participate in special camp events where they meet new
friends, learn treasured camp traditions, and make memories.

When not in class, campers are always under the supervision of our counselors.

Can VAMPY accommodate a student with special needs?In most cases, yes. We have experience working with students who require assistance
getting around campus, have dietary restrictions, need specific learning accommodations,
have ongoing medical conditions, and/or have other special needs. If you have any
concerns or questions, please contact Julia Roberts at [julia.roberts@wku.edu](mailto:julia.roberts@wku.edu) or (270) 745-6323.

How long has VAMPY been around?VAMPY, originally called The Summer Program, was first launched by The Center in 1984
in cooperation with the Duke Talent Identification Program (TIP). Thousands of young
people from across the country and from many foreign countries have participated in
the program. We are proud that for 42 years, we have met the needs of high-ability
students for summer enrichment experiences alongside like-minded peers.

Is there a code of conduct?   
VAMPY participants and their parents will be asked to sign a code of conduct that
states that the camper will abide by the rules of the camp and by the standards of
conduct set forth by their teachers and staff at The Center for Gifted Studies. It
also stipulates conditions for use of the Internet. The code of conduct also states
that campers may not leave campus unless a parent/guardian has made prior written
arrangements. Finally, it emphasizes the severe consequences — being sent home without
refund of registration fee — if a camper is found with tobacco products, illegal drugs,
or alcohol or if a camper endangers his or her own health or welfare or that of others.
This code of conduct exists to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all.

How much spending money should campers bring?  
Campers will need money only for miscellaneous items from The WKU Store and for snacks
from campus vending machines (optional). Please do not bring large amounts of money.

What arrangements are made for campers arriving by plane?

Please schedule your camper's flight to arrive at the Nashville, TN, airport on the
first day of camp between **12 p.m. and 3 p.m. (CDT).** On the last day of camp, please schedule your return flight to leave from the Nashville,
TN airport between **1 p.m. and 3 p.m. (CDT)**. There will be a $200 charge ($100 each way) for transportation by chartered bus
or van to and from the Nashville airport.

If your airport arrival and departure times do not fit our guidelines, please call
so we can make arrangements.

Payment for airport transportation will be due by **May 15**.

Will students have access to their cell phones?Camp is an opportunity to make lasting friendships and learn from opportunities in
and out of the classroom. Each camper may bring one cell phone, which will only be
used to communicate with parents. Campers will give their phone to the counselor at
check-in. Phones will remain with the counselors except when it is time to call home
twice a week. Daily calls will not be possible because the activity schedule varies,
and calling times will not begin until after the first three days of camp. Any cell
phone not checked in with the appropriate counselor will be taken by a staff member
and returned at the end of camp. No other devices that connect to the Internet or
make calls are allowed. Parents and campers will sign a form at check-in verifying
that the camper has no such devices.

For campers concerned about letting go of their devices for three weeks, consider
this comment from a camper: “The fact that cell phones aren’t allowed makes everyone
interact face to face, and it’s more fun than if they were allowed!”

How can campers receive communication?

***By mail****(M**ail must be addressed as follows; it may be lost if addressed any other way)*Student’s Name  
c/o The Center for Gifted Studies, VAMPY  
Western Kentucky University  
1906 College Heights Blvd. #71031  
Bowling Green, KY 42101-1031

Mail is delivered to the office five days a week, Monday through Friday. Counselors
will distribute mail as campers return from class each day. Receiving mail is special
for campers, and letter-writing instead of calling is encouraged. For some young people,
this experience will be the first extended period away from home. Parents are encouraged
to write positive, supportive letters to help students get the most out of VAMPY.

***By phone***In an emergency, parents may call the office at (270) 745-6323 between 8 a.m. and
4:30 p.m. (CDT), and a staff member will arrange for your child to call you. After
office hours and on weekends, you may call the front desk of Florence Schneider Hall
at (270) 936-2711 to leave a message.

Please leave your phone on at night, so we can contact you in the rare event that
it might be necessary.

What if campers get homesick or have roommate troubles?Homesickness and roommate adjustment issues are not unusual, especially during the
first few days. If your child expresses such concerns, please contact the office so
that together we can help your child have a positive and successful experience.

**If you have questions not addressed here, please feel free to contact us****via email at [julia.roberts@wku.edu](mailto:julia.roberts@wku.edu)or by calling (270) 745-6323.**
