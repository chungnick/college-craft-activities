**2026 VAMPY Course List**

After reading the descriptions and noting the qualifying ACT or SAT scores for each
class, please write the name of your first, second, and third choices in the spaces
provided on the application. Consider your choices carefully. You need to be interested in the class you choose
as well as willing to give your best effort for three weeks. If your first choice
is filled, you will be placed in the next available choice.

**An ACT or SAT score is required for all VAMPY applicants. Students who have registered
to take the ACT or SAT by April 11 may apply and provide scores at a later date.**

**Astronomy  
Madison Staton**

In this inquiry-driven astronomy course, students will explore how the universe works
by investigating powerful phenomena—from meteors streaking across Earth’s sky to stars
that suddenly appear and disappear. Using real-world events like the Chelyabinsk meteor
and historical observations of exploding stars, students will figure out how gravity,
energy, and motion govern objects in space and shape Earth’s past, present, and future.

By day, students will study orbital motion, gravitational interactions, asteroid impacts,
and Earth’s geologic history to understand how collisions from space have influenced
life on our planet and how we can prepare for future threats. They will also explore
why stars shine, how they change over time, and how the elements that make up our
world were forged in stellar interiors and cosmic events.

By night, students will learn to use telescopes to observe the sky, identify stars,
planets, and constellations, and connect their observations to the larger structure
and history of the universe. Throughout the course, students will engage in modeling,
data analysis, and scientific argumentation—building the skills needed to think like
astronomers and to carry a lifelong curiosity about the cosmos.

School, including Anatomy and Physiology, Forensics, and Environmental Science. I
attended the Mahurin Honors College at Western Kentucky University, where I received
my Bachelor’s degree in Middle School Science Education in 2019. In 2021, I earned
my Master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction with an emphasis in Educational Technology
from Purdue University. In 2022, I earned my Rank 1 in STEM Teaching Leadership from
the NASA Endeavor STEM Teaching Program. When not teaching, I love gardening, cooking,
playing board games, and spending time with my family.

**Chemistry  
Trevor Webster**

Students in this course will take an in-depth look at matter and energy. Each day
students will be engaged in lessons that will develop their chemical content knowledge,
critical thinking abilities, and problem solving skills. By the end of the course,
successful students will be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the structure
and properties of chemical systems using the practices of the discipline, including:
developing and using models; analyzing and interpreting data; using mathematics and
computational thinking; designing and conducting experiments; obtaining, evaluating,
and communicating information; and more. Through participation in course activities,
students will gain experience in the cross-cutting concepts of cause and effect, patterns,
structure and function, stability and change, and scale, proportion, and quantity.
Students will participate in at least one laboratory activity daily, along with engaging
demonstrations that develop interest and curiosity about the content. (They will be
expected to adhere to the safety rules set forth on the first day of class.) Throughout
the class, students will also have problem-solving opportunities as they develop a
deep understanding of chemistry content.
