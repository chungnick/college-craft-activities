New York City is one of the world's most vibrant, culturally rich cities, and residents of NYU's residence halls are at the center of the excitement. Whether you're living in one of the residence halls centered around Washington Square in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights, or in a residence hall located in one of the city's other bustling neighborhoods, there is an endless amount of activity.

### **Hall Types**

* **Apartment Style:** residences with a kitchen in the suite/apartment.
* **Traditional Style**: residences with no kitchen in the suite. A communal hall kitchen is available in most traditional style halls. Brittany and Founders Halls provide a microwave and refrigerator in each suite to be shared among roommates.

### What's Provided

Each resident is provided the following in their room:

* An extra long twin bed and mattress (39"x80")
* A desk and chair
* Drawer space (either underbed or dresser)
* Either a closet or wardrobe cabinet
