## High School Summer Pre-College Opportunities

##### **Earn UC Credit. Explore Your Future. Experience College Life.**

Every summer, UC Santa Cruz invites high school students to begin their college journey early. Through our for-credit, pre-college pathway, eligible students register to enroll in UC undergraduate courses online or as in-person commuters to begin building their official college transcript. Students earn UC credit that transfers to future colleges and universities.

With hundreds of classes, multiple summer sessions, and flexible learning formats, students can get ahead academically while discovering what excites them most.

> *Taking this class this summer has helped me get ahead academically by earning credits early, which means I can explore more advanced courses or focus on my favorite subjects during the school year. – Samantha Fitzgerald, 2025*

### Why Students Choose High School Summer Pre-College

#### **🏫 Earn UC Credits that Count**

Take credit-bearing UC coursework and build your official college transcript before high school graduation. Students can:

* Complete prerequisites
* Satisfy A–G requirements
* Meet future major requirements
* Start earning units toward their degree

#### **🎓 Experience College-Level Learning**

Unlike typical enrichment programs, students learn in genuine UC undergraduate classes, side-by-side with UC students. They gain firsthand experience with college expectations, academic rigor, and classroom culture, all while making progress toward a college degree.

#### ****📘 Explore Majors and Interests****

* Summer is the perfect time to explore a major or take a deep dive into an area of interest. Students strengthen academic skills, like note-taking and time management, and can build technical knowledge in areas such as:
* Math
* Linguistics
* Computational media
* …and many more.

#### **⏳ Flexible Online or In-Person (Commuter) Options**

Students choose from classes that are taught:

* **Online synchronous**: classes that meet at set days and times
* **Online asynchronous**: completed at your own pace (with regular deadlines)
* **In-person:** commute to campus for classes

Online courses are just like their face-to-face equivalents and offer the same rigor and expectations. Students are challenged, encouraged to think deeply, and expected to perform undergraduate university-level work and earn the same credits as UC students.

### Summer Basics

Summer Session is a 10-week quarter divided into four sessions.. Most classes are offered in an accelerated 5-week format in Session 1 or Session 2. We recommend Session 1 classes to avoid potential conflicts with students’ return to high school classes in the fall:

**Session 1**: (recommended): June 22 – July 24, 2026

**Session 2**: July 27 – August 18, 2026

**8-Week**: June 22 – August 14, 2026

**10-Week:** June 22 – August 28, 2026

Students can browse courses by interest track or department and explore past syllabi to understand what to expect.

Summer tuition is charged per credit, with 5 credits being the standard for most classes and the Campus Fee, which is a one-time charge in summer to all students enrolled in classes, both online and in-person.

### Online vs. In-Person Commuter: What’s the Difference?

**Online Courses**Great for students outside the area or those who prefer flexibility. Courses are just as rigorous as in-person classes and include deep academic engagement.

**In-Person Commuter**Experience the undergraduate environment firsthand. Students get access to campus resources like:

* Libraries
* Fitness center
* Campus buses (with UCSC ID card)

(Please note: High school students are not eligible to live in on-campus housing)
