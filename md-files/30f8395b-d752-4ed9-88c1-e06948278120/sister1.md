### Campus Fee

* The Campus Fee is mandatory for students enrolled in credits (on-campus, remotely, and online). It is charged every quarter at UC Santa Cruz. The only exception is for newly admitted students taking the one-credit [Slug Orientation Course](https://orientation.ucsc.edu/) (with nothing additional).
* The Campus Fee is not a fee for usage of the campus. It is a campus-based fee, meaning it varies across the UC system’s different campuses, charged by all UCs, all quarters, and semesters.
* Our Campus Fee is a culmination of fees that UCSC students have self-assessed to fund services, resources, and projects that they have approved by votes of the student body and ratified by the Senate, approved by the Chancellor, and ultimately, the President of the University of California.

## VA Benefits

Continuing UC students attending Summer Session can use their Cal Vet waiver. Cal Vet waives the Summer Session tuition and course fees. **The mandatory campus fee is not waived by Cal Vet.** New fall admits can use their GI Bill for the preceding summer if the courses fulfill their degree requirements. Students from another UC Campus or California Community College may use the GI Bill with a Parent School Letter agreement. Contact the [UCSC VA Certifying Official](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/enrollment/veterans/index.html) or email [vets\_benefits@ucsc.edu](mailto:vets_benefits@ucsc.edu) for more information.

Tuition and fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Figures for tuition and fees represent currently approved amounts and may not be final. Actual tuition and fees are subject to change by the University of California as determined to be necessary or appropriate. Final approved tuition and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.
