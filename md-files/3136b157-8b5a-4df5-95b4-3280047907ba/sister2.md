Each of us has an imagination. When we look at our world, we think of new ways to do things, new ways to live. Engineers are people who take the next step: they make their ideas work. The results are all around us—hybrid cars that reduce pollution, cell phones that play music and games, MRI scanners that can spot diseases in the body, the list is virtually endless.

[Students: Schedule a Visit to Campus](https://futureumdengr.wufoo.com/forms/clark-school-student-visit-request-form/) [Teachers: Schedule a Visit to Campus](https://futureumdengr.wufoo.com/forms/clark-school-of-engineering-school-visit-request/) [Teachers: Request a Classroom Visit](https://futureumdengr.wufoo.com/forms/clark-school-of-engineering-school-visit-request/)

What would you include in a top-ten list of inventions? Airplanes? TV remotes? The Internet? DNA testing? Microwave ovens? Artificial hearts?

There's an organization called the National Academy of Engineering that has created just such a list, with interesting information to help you understand how they made their choices. Their web site is called [The Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century](http://www.greatachievements.org/).

Do you agree with their selections? How do their ideas compare with yours? And what would you imagine as the top inventions for the future?

**Here at the Clark School, we help people become engineers and make their imaginative ideas come true. If you're curious about engineering, and wonder whether it's something you might enjoy—or if you're the parent or teacher of someone who fits that description—we have several ways to help you explore.**

## Summer Programs

Do you want to learn how to use power tools or build an underwater Robot? Clark School summer programs let middle and high school students solve interesting engineering problems and engage in teamwork right here on the university campus.
