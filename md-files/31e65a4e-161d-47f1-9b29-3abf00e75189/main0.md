> > *I never really thought that I would actually get into college. Then, I started Upward Bound and I have grown and blossomed...I brought my grades up when I thought I couldn't, and I have made amazing and accepting friends who have the same goals as I do. I want to be a model for my little brother and show him that with a little push and hard work he can be anything and be rewarded in the end. UB family - Thank you!*
