## FAQs

## Q: Can family members visit during camps?

For safety reasons, we do not allow family members to visit for the duration of camps. Once a camper is checked in, they are under Aggie STEM staff supervision until an approved delegate checks them out.

## Q: Do campers need to bring their own computers?

Some classes over the summer require our campers to use electronic devices. Campers are recommended to bring their own laptop devices at their own discretion. Aggie STEM is not responsible for damaged or lost devices.

## Q: Who do we contact in case of an emergency during camps?

Call or text the Aggie STEM phone line: 281-944-8532

## Q: I am a representative for a school district. Who can I contact for more information and pricing?

We love partnering with school districts! Please contact aggiestem@tamu.edu for more information.

## Q: Is it okay if my camper cannot attend the whole week of camp?

Yes, it is okay. However, we only allow campers to be checked out during specific time frames throughout the camp week. Make sure you email aggiestem@tamu.edu stating your request.

## Q: Do you offer any scholarships?

Yes, we do have a limited number of need-based partial scholarships available each year. Aggie STEM will not be awarding any full scholarships for the 2026 camp season. The scholarship application will be included in the online registration process.
