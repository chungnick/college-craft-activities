The University of Chicago hosts a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in molecular engineering program that offers undergraduate students attending non-research colleges or universities the opportunity to gain authentic research experience working in the research labs of Pritzker Molecular Engineering (PME) faculty members.

To apply for the REU Program in Molecular Engineering, [**complete the online application**](https://etap.nsf.gov/award/8321/opportunity/11439) by February 12, 2026. Successful candidates will be contacted by mid-March.

Interested in learning more? [**Register for our virtual information session**](https://forms.gle/phJ9ro2PYJA6FeNv7) **on January 20, 2026 at 1 pm CST.**

The program is open to 10 students during a 10-week summer research experience and features:

* Support from a mentoring team of PME researchers in conducting mentored scientific research;
* Immersion in the University’s research culture, including faculty research seminars and lab safety and ethics training;
* Science communication training and the opportunity to present your work to the University community;
* Resources and support for the graduate school application process; and
* Guidance preparing a written report of your work, and possible follow-on mentorship beyond the summer to write technical reports and possibly prepare a paper for submission to a conference.

Based on students' preferences and faculty availability, each student will be assigned a faculty mentor and a graduate student/postdoc supervisor, and will design a research project in close consultation with those mentors. Active participation in that research project will be the main focus of the summer experience, and students will be expected to participate in research for 40 hours per week for the full 10 weeks.

Example research projects include: self-assembling polymers for nanomanufacturing, immune system engineering to prevent and treat diseases, quantum material development for next-generation information and sensing technologies, and molecular-level energy storage and harvesting tools and techniques.

To be an REU participant, you must be a US citizen or permanent resident enrolled in (but not yet graduated from) an accredited undergraduate college degree program with a major in a STEM field.

We select REU program participants from a nationwide pool. Our target students tend to share the following characteristics:

* Strong background in chemistry, physics, biology, or computer science as well as mathematics
* Sound past academic performance
* Interest in attending graduate school and pursuing a career in science

We also aim to broaden the STEM pipeline for undergraduate students across the US, including those attending a college or university where research opportunities are limited.

After you’re chosen to participate in the program, you’ll be registered at the University of Chicago (associated costs and fees will be covered by the program). Benefits include:

* $7,000 stipend
* Modest travel allowance
* Housing and meals for the duration of the program
* Access to libraries, athletic facilities, and substantial discounts to University-sponsored social and cultural events
