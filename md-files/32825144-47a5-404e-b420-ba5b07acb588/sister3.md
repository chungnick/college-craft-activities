UChicago PME hosts up to 20 students from the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) each summer for a three-week, intensive introduction to Molecular Engineering, exploring three thematic research areas: *Immuno-engineering, Quantum Engineering, and Materials for Sustainability*.

The course, designed to open pathways for more City Colleges students to transfer into four-year STEM degree programs, has been part of PME’s mission since the school’s 2019 launch with a $100 million commitment from the Pritzker Foundation. “Some of our first conversations were about how we could show our commitment to the city by broadening the pipeline of Chicago students into STEM majors and professions,” said Matthew Tirrell, the D. Gale Johnson Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus. “As the nation’s first school of molecular engineering, UChicago PME is uniquely positioned to introduce students to this emerging field.”
