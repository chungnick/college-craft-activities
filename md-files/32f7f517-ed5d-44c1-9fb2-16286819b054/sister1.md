# Tuition & Aid

**Please register for our free [Tuition & Financial Aid](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/2467483763070839638) webinar for more information.**

For YYGS Residential students, the full program tuition for one, 2-week session is **$7,000 USD**.

Please note that tuition covers all on-campus components of the program (housing, meals, curriculum materials, air chilled rooms, etc.), but **travel is not covered** due to our program size and the legal and logistical limitations of working with globally diverse families.

YYGS offers [Need-Based Financial Aid](/tuition/financial-aid) (covering up to the full cost of tuition) for all domestic and international students, and then all students coordinate and pay/fundraise to cover their [transportation](/arrival-departure-details) needs.

**Please note that any/all YYGS tuition payments made are non-refundable**, except in extreme circumstances such as visa denial or family medical emergency where documentation can be provided to YYGS (e.g., of good faith attempts to secure a visa, with an official doctor’s note from a non-relative).

## Payment Deadlines:

**Full tuition payment** is due on December 17, 2025 for [Early Action](/application-deadlines) admits, and March 15, 2026 for [Regular Decision](/application-deadlines) admits.

## How to Pay:

Tuition fees are paid using a payment gateway, since YYGS uses external payment processors to accommodate both domestic and international applicants. Tuition payments can be subject to processing fees by the external payment processor (Slate or FlyWire). Students can access this gateway by logging into their application, which will direct them to the Application Status page.
