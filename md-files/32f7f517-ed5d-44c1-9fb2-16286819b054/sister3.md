# How to Apply

Get Started:

| **Step 2** | Review the [YYGS application required components.](/required-components) |
| **Step 3** | Review a [PDF of a sample blank application](/preview-application), and start preparing to answer as many application questions as possible. |
| **Step 4** | You will need to submit contact information for a parent/guardian, teacher, and/or official at your school. Reach out to them as soon as possible to review the [PDF of a sample blank application](/preview-application) with you, and be sure to collect the information you need. |

## Complete the Application:

| **Step 7** | Once your application is complete, click on the “Review” page. Next click on the “Submit Application” button at the bottom of the page. |

If you submitted a completed Fee Waiver request, then you can check your Applicant Status Portal to see when it is approved or denied.
