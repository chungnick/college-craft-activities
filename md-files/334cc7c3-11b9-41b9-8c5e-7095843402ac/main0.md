# Summer Scholars

Dates - Session I: June 6- 20, 2026 | Session II: June 27 - July 11, 2026

[Apply](https://enrollment.nd.edu/apply)

Summer Scholars participants spend two intensive weeks on Notre Dame's campus taking a challenging college-level course taught by Notre Dame faculty. We keep the classes small and the personal attention from Notre Dame faculty high. The coursework is a true preview of college academics—it is both rigorous and rewarding, and students could earn one transferable college credit upon the completion of a program track. Students collaborate on coursework outside designated class times as they would in any college setting. There is also ample time to enjoy the social facets of college life, especially those unique to Notre Dame.
