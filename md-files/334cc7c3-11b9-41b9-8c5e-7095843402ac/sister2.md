The Office of Pre-College Programs does not offer merit-based financial assistance or scholarships. Please note that submitting a request for financial aid does not guarantee an application fee waiver or scholarship. Application fee waiver decisions will be made on a weekly basis. Once a decision is made, you will be notified via email. Decisions regarding admission will be made regardless of financial aid request, and notification of tuition-based financial aid will be included with admission decision letters.
