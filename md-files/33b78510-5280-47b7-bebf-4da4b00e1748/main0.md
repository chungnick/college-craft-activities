# Future Leaders Summer Program

**PROGRAM DATES: July 12 – Aug. 1, 2026**

Become a global leader of tomorrow!

This unique program is designed for high school students to develop problem-solving and diplomacy skills in global affairs, with a focus on the interconnected roles of China, India, the U.S., and other countries in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions.

In this hands-on program, working with students from around the world, you'll dive into one of today's most pressing global challenges: **climate change, artificial intelligence, digital influence** or **energy innovation**.

After choosing your specific focus, you'll research a real-world leader or expert in that field and step into their shoes to represent their views. Working with your team, you'll debate, negotiate, and develop actionable solutions using up-to-date, real-world data, culminating in a collaborative action research report and a final presentation at the end of the program.

The program is organized by the Global Leadership Institute at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, in partnership with the [21st Century China Center](https://china.ucsd.edu/) and the [21st Century India Center](https://india.ucsd.edu/).

## [Program and Curriculum](#)

The program tackles four critical issues of global importance. During the interactive game play, you will learn about the latest scientific research and discoveries that have promoted innovation and influenced global policy decisions in one of the four focus areas: **climate crisis, artificial intelligence, digital influence and energy innovation**.

**Climate Crisis**Explore how nations work together to confront global warming, protect ecosystems and build sustainable futures through policy, innovation and collaboration. Learn how leadership and science intersect to drive real change on a global scale.

**Artificial Intelligence**Experience how AI is transforming economies and governance while raising critical questions about ethics, equity and global competition. Examine the promise of breakthroughs in healthcare and sustainability, and challenges of privacy, bias and inequality.

**Digital Influence**Investigate the growing power of digital influence in shaping global events, public opinion and policy decisions. Confront questions of who controls information in the modern age and how that control impacts democracy and security. Develop the understanding needed to navigate misinformation, build trust and lead responsibly in a connected world.

**Energy Innovation**Explore how renewable technologies and emerging energy systems are redefining the balance of power among nations. From solar and wind to nuclear and green hydrogen, discover how innovation fuels both competition and cooperation in the race for a sustainable future.

### Team Projects and Final Presentations:

Throughout the program, participants collaborate in small teams, each focusing on one of the FLSP’s major global themes.

Working together, teams research and develop innovative ideas to address real-world challenges in their chosen areas. Faculty mentors and program staff provide guidance as students refine their projects and prepare to share their insights.

**Each team will:**

* Explore one of the program’s key themes
* Develop a practical idea or solution to a global issue
* Work collaboratively to design a final presentation

The program concludes with Final Presentation Day—a celebration of creativity, teamwork and achievement.

On this day, each team presents their work to the whole FLSP community. Parents, friends and guests are invited to attend and celebrate the students’ accomplishments. Participants should dress professionally for this special event, marking their successful completion of the program.
