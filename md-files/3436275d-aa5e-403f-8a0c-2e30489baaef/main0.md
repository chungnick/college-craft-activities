# Welcome

Yale Pathways Research Internships (YPRI) connects qualified public high school students from the New Haven area with scientific research labs at Yale for a **seven-week summer internship**. These research experiences excite students about scientific investigation, enable them to explore new scientific fields, and increase their college preparedness. In doing so, we aim to foster long-term relationships between Yale laboratories and accomplished high school students who are enthusiastic about pursuing research.

## Interested in hosting interns?

If you would like to host a student intern, please email Yale Pathways at [yalepathways@yale.edu](mailto:yalepathways@yale.edu) by Jan 23 with the subject line “YPRI 2026 Lab Interest”.
