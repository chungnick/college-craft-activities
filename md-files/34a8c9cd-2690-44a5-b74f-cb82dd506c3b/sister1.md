* [Letter to TRIO and GEAR UP programs' project directors about an ED and HHS collaborative for disconnected youth](/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ope/ed-hhs-dpdl.doc) (MS Word, 76K)

**Program Office:** [Federal TRIO Programs](https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-higher-education/trio-home-page)  
**CFDA Number:** 84.047  
**Program Type:** Discretionary/Competitive Grants  
**Also Known As:** TRIO (Upward Bound is one of eight TRIO programs.)

**Program Description**

Upward Bound provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The program provides opportunities for participants to succeed in their precollege performance and ultimately in their higher education pursuits. Upward Bound serves: high school students from low-income families; and high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree. The goal of Upward Bound is to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education.

**Types of Projects**

Upward Bound projects provide academic instruction in mathematics, laboratory sciences, composition, literature, and foreign languages. Tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment, work-study programs, education or counseling services designed to improve the financial and economic literacy of students; and programs and activities previously mentioned that are specially designed for students who are limited English proficient, students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, students with disabilities, students who are homeless children and youths, students who are in foster care or are aging out of foster care system or other disconnected students.

**Additional Information**

All Upward Bound projects MUST provide instruction in math, laboratory science, composition, literature, and foreign language. Other services include:

* Information on the full range of Federal Student Financial Aid programs and benefits
* Guidance and assistance on secondary school reentry, alternative education programs, or entry into general educational development programs or postsecondary education

**Who May Apply: (by category)** Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), Local Education Agencies (LEAs), Nonprofit Organizations, Other Organizations and/or Agencies, State Education Agencies (SEAs)

**Who May Apply: (specifically)** Institutions of higher education, public and private agencies and organizations including community-based organizations with experience in serving disadvantaged youth, combinations of such institutions, agencies and organizations, and as appropriate to the purposes of the program, secondary schools.

Students must have completed the 8th grade, be between the ages of 13 and 19, and have a need for academic support in order to pursue a program of postsecondary education. All students must be either from low-income families or be potential first-generation college students. The program requires that two-thirds of the participants in a project must be both low-income and potential first-generation students. The remaining one-third must be either low-income, first-generation college students, or students who have a high risk for academic failure.

* [Title 34 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 645](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=66232ebc6c3cd264abb5f8ad837ab779&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr645_main_02.tpl)

## Guidance

* **Uniform Guidance Information for ED Grantees --**[**Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards**](https://www.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/uniform-guidance/index.html)**:** The Department has worked closely with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to streamline some federal circulars into a single guidance document, and make conforming changes to Department regulations. The old rules do not change — they are simply repackaged and enhanced to reduce burden on grantees. The new combined document is known as the "Uniform Guidance" and is codified at [2 CFR 200](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=776952145dc00a3033afa43512ac1475&mc=true&node=pt2.1.200&rgn=div5). The new guidance will take effect for recipients of Federal funds for awards made on or after December 26, 2014. The new regulations do not impact any Department of Education awards received prior to this date.

[TOP](#top)  
  
2. What kinds of activities can be supported with grant funds?

Any project assisted under the UB Program must provide:

* Academic tutoring to enable students to complete secondary or postsecondary courses, which may include instruction in reading, writing, study skills, mathematics, science and other subjects;
* Advice and assistance in secondary and postsecondary course selection;
* Assistance in preparing for college entrance examinations and completing college admission applications;

* Guidance on and assistance in secondary school reentry; alternative education programs for secondary school dropouts that lead to the receipt of a regular secondary school diploma; entry into general educational development (GED) programs or entry into postsecondary education; and
* Education or counseling services designed to improve the financial and economic literacy of students or the students' parents, including financial planning for postsecondary education
* Any project that has received funds for at least two years must include as part of its core curriculum in the next and succeeding years, instruction in mathematics through pre-calculus; laboratory science; foreign language; composition; and literature.

An UB project may provide the following services:

* Exposure to cultural events, academic programs, and other activities not usually available to disadvantaged youth;
* Information, activities, and instruction designed to acquaint youth participating in the project with the range of career options available to the youth;
* On-campus residential programs;
* Mentoring programs involving elementary school or secondary school teachers or counselors, faculty members at institutions of higher education, students, or any combination of these persons;
* Work-study positions where youth participating in the project are exposed to careers requiring a postsecondary degree;
* Programs and activities that are specially designed for participants who are limited English proficient; participants from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, participants who are individuals with disabilities, participants who are homeless children and youths, participants in or who are aging out of foster care, or other disconnected participants; and

7. What are the reporting requirements for grantees? What kinds of records and data should be maintained or collected in order to complete required reports?

All UB grantees are required to submit an annual performance report (APR) documenting progress toward meeting their approved project objectives.

A grantee must maintain a record of:

* The basis for the grantee's determination that the participant is eligible to participate in the project;
* The basis for the grantee's determination that the participant has a need for academic support in order to pursue successfully a program of education beyond secondary school;
* The services that are provided to the participant;
* The educational progress of the participant during high school and, to the degree possible, during the participant's pursuit of a postsecondary education program; and
* To the extent practicable, any services the participant receives during the project year from another Federal TRIO program or another federally-funded program that serves populations similar to those served under the UB program.

[TOP](#top)

* [Letter to TRIO and GEAR UP programs' project directors about an ED and HHS collaborative for disconnected youth](/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ope/ed-hhs-dpdl.doc) (MS Word, 76K)

**Program Office:** [Federal TRIO Programs](https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-higher-education/trio-home-page)  
**CFDA Number:** 84.047  
**Program Type:** Discretionary/Competitive Grants  
**Also Known As:** TRIO (Upward Bound is one of eight TRIO programs.)

**Program Description**

Upward Bound provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The program provides opportunities for participants to succeed in their precollege performance and ultimately in their higher education pursuits. Upward Bound serves: high school students from low-income families; and high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree. The goal of Upward Bound is to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education.

**Types of Projects**

Upward Bound projects provide academic instruction in mathematics, laboratory sciences, composition, literature, and foreign languages. Tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment, work-study programs, education or counseling services designed to improve the financial and economic literacy of students; and programs and activities previously mentioned that are specially designed for students who are limited English proficient, students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, students with disabilities, students who are homeless children and youths, students who are in foster care or are aging out of foster care system or other disconnected students.

**Additional Information**

All Upward Bound projects MUST provide instruction in math, laboratory science, composition, literature, and foreign language. Other services include:

* Information on the full range of Federal Student Financial Aid programs and benefits
* Guidance and assistance on secondary school reentry, alternative education programs, or entry into general educational development programs or postsecondary education

#### Eligibility

**Who May Apply: (by category)** Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), Local Education Agencies (LEAs), Nonprofit Organizations, Other Organizations and/or Agencies, State Education Agencies (SEAs)

**Who May Apply: (specifically)** Institutions of higher education, public and private agencies and organizations including community-based organizations with experience in serving disadvantaged youth, combinations of such institutions, agencies and organizations, and as appropriate to the purposes of the program, secondary schools.

Students must have completed the 8th grade, be between the ages of 13 and 19, and have a need for academic support in order to pursue a program of postsecondary education. All students must be either from low-income families or be potential first-generation college students. The program requires that two-thirds of the participants in a project must be both low-income and potential first-generation students. The remaining one-third must be either low-income, first-generation college students, or students who have a high risk for academic failure.

## Regulations

* Official Final Regulations Amending TRIO Regulations, as published in the *Federal Register* on October 26, 2010. These final regulations amend the Upward Bound program regulations. [[HTML](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-10-26/html/2010-24324.htm)]
* [Title 34 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 645](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=66232ebc6c3cd264abb5f8ad837ab779&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr645_main_02.tpl)

## Guidance

* **Uniform Guidance Information for ED Grantees --**[**Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards**](https://www.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/uniform-guidance/index.html)**:** The Department has worked closely with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to streamline some federal circulars into a single guidance document, and make conforming changes to Department regulations. The old rules do not change — they are simply repackaged and enhanced to reduce burden on grantees. The new combined document is known as the "Uniform Guidance" and is codified at [2 CFR 200](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=776952145dc00a3033afa43512ac1475&mc=true&node=pt2.1.200&rgn=div5). The new guidance will take effect for recipients of Federal funds for awards made on or after December 26, 2014. The new regulations do not impact any Department of Education awards received prior to this date.
