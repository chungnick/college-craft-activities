#### Reflections as a Membership Tool

  

The Reflections program is a benefit available because of your PTA's efforts and commitment to expanding access to the arts. As part of hosting Reflections, remember to use the program to grow and build your PTA membership.

Grow Your PTA Family with Reflections

##### Grow Your PTA Family with Reflections

Throughout the program, use National PTA's [**YOU Belong in PTA**](https://www.pta.org/home/run-your-pta/membership-resources/reasons-you-belong/you-belong-in-pta-programs "YOU Belong in PTA — Grow Your PTA with Programs") materials to start conversations about your accomplishments in advancing arts education and invite others to join.

Here are a few ideas you can incorporate into your program efforts:

* **Create customized content flyers.**Download and personalize Reflections-specific membership flyers to include with Student Entry Packets. [**Find resources and directions for customization**](https://www.pta.org/home/run-your-pta/membership-resources/reasons-you-belong/you-belong-in-pta-programs#:~:text=Spanish%20Black%20%26%20White-,Customizable%20Content%20Flyers,-Want%20to%20spread).

* **Make joining quick and easy.**Include a membership collection box at celebration events or exhibits, provide membership forms, envelopes, and a collection box to facilitate easy joining.

* **Engage students in recruitment.** Have student artists manage a membership table or speak at PTA meetings/events to share how Reflections benefits them.

Recognition and Celebration

Program Wrap Up

#### Planning

  

To get started, learn about the program with the information outlined by National PTA in this guide and materials from past PTA leaders. Connect with your state PTA to enhance your understanding. Afterwards, use the [PTA Leader Program Checklist](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/pta-leader-program-checklist_eng.pdf) to get started and plan your program, set clear goals and develop materials.   
  
To get organized, develop a customized [SMARTIE Goals and Project Plan](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/school-of-excellence/2020/smartie-goals-worksheet_soe.docx "SMARTIE Tool") that your PTA can follow through the planning process.   
  
Use the dropdown menus below to guide your initial planning.

Key Areas for Program Planning

### Key Areas for Program Planning

Consider the following five key areas for program planning to set your PTA and program up for success.

##### **1.) Determine Recognition Goals for Your Program**

Reflections is multi-level program where PTAs can advance entries for additional recognition (e.g., district, region, council, community), including at the national level. The program levels are determined by each state PTA and *only state PTAs may advance entries directly to the national level.*See the Recognition and Celebrations section for benefits of advancing entries.   
  
Early in your planning, set goals for recognition, specifically around advancing entries as this will determine key details like deadlines, participation rules, and submission processes. Consider the following

* **Local and Additional Recognition** (Advancing Entries)**:** Determine if you will advance entries, as this affects deadlines, participation rules, and submission processes. Follow state PTA requirements for advancing artwork.

* **Local and Community Recognition Only** (Not Advancing Entries):  Host without advancing entries to build capacity, create community connections, and explore interest in arts programming. Use general materials from your state and National PTA, and set your own deadlines and submission processes.

##### **2.) Choose Categories and Divisions**

PTAs can offer one or more of the available arts categories and divisions. If you are new to Reflections, start with one or two categories to manage fewer entries, recruit fewer volunteer reviewers and purchase fewer prizes. National PTA offers guidelines for the categories and division on the Craft Your Entry page; however, additional or varying requirements may be specified by your state PTA.  
  
The arts categories and divisions offered by National PTA are as follows:

* **Categories:** Dance Choreography, Film Production, Literature, Music Composition, Photography, Visual Arts

* **Divisions:** Primary (Pre-K to Grade 2), Intermediate (Grades 3-5), Middle School (Grades 6-8), High School (Grades 9-12) and Accessible Arts (All grades welcome). *The Accessible Arts Division welcomes students who identify as having a disability and may receive services under IDEA or ADA: Section 504 and offers non-artistic, division-specific accommodations.*

##### **3.) Program Timeline**

Set dates for the launch, deadline, review and celebrations. Program timelines generally look like the following, but each state may vary:

* **April – August:** Connect with state PTA to begin program planning and promotion

* **September – October:** Local PTA deadlines and review

* **November – January:** District/council/region PTA deadlines and review

##### 4.) Set Processes for Artwork Collection and Review

Your PTA will collect entries and coordinate a review of submissions to find your student winners. Early planning for artwork collection is critical to inform clear direction provided to participants.

**See Guide Section "Collect and Review Artwork" for guidance and details.**

##### 5.) Determine Awards and Budget

Consider awards and recognition based on PTA goals, capacity and timeline. If advancing entries to the next level, contact state PTA for guidance on the number of awards and submissions that may advance Allocate funds for award materials and celebrations.  
  
PTAs are encouraged to provide additional awards or recognition at their discretion; however, National PTA recommends and uses the following award classifications:

* Award of Merit

* Award of Excellence

* Outstanding Interpretation Award *(Given to the entry with the best interpretation of the theme in each category and the Accessible Arts Division.)*

Program Materials

### Program Materials

Ensure a participant-friendly Reflections experience for students and families by providing all the relevant information and resources they need to submit successful and eligible entries.

##### **Gather and Customize Materials**

Visit your state PTA website to download important materials that students need to participate and that your PTA needs to host the program. Customize materials with specific details for your PTA or Reflections program, such as deadlines, contact information and submission instructions.

Be sure your PTA has access to at least the following:

* Official guidelines

* Arts category and division rules

* Student Entry Form

* Reflections review materials

Along with the materials provided by your state PTA, National PTA provides general resources to support your program implementation in the [Reflections Program Resources](#resources) section above.

##### **Distribute Program Materials**

Once your materials are customized for participants, share them with teachers, PTA leaders, students and families. Consider these ideas for distributing program materials to families and participants:

* **Website Hub**: Create a one-stop-shop on your PTA’s website for all program details and materials.

* **Targeted Emails**: Send emails to past participants with all necessary information and links.

* **Classroom Visits**: Have PTA members or student representatives visit classrooms to talk about the program and distribute materials.

* **Teacher involvement:** Ask teachers to announce the program in classes or during parent-teacher conferences and to distribute materials or information to interested students.

* **Learning Opportunities:** Host virtual or in-person art workshops led by local artists or teachers.

Promotion Ideas

### Promotion Ideas

PTAs play a critical role in widely promoting and sharing Reflections as a PTA program to PTAs, schools and families. To assist, National PTA provides ready-to-use theme graphics and posters to share with your community in the [Reflections Program Resources](#resources) section above.

##### **Promotion and Awareness**

* **Themed Posters and Flyers**: Use theme materials from your state or National PTA or design eye-catching posters and flyers.

* **School Promotion**: Share calls for entries in morning announcements, a dedicated section of a website or newsletter, social media or school bulletin boards.

* **Video Announcements**: Create short videos explaining the theme.

##### **Engagement and Participation**

* **Event Presence**: Hand out program materials and answer participant questions at a Reflections table during school events. Set up in high-traffic areas like school entrances, the front office, or the library.

* **Teacher Involvement**: Ask teachers to announce the program in classes or during parent-teacher conferences and to incorporate the theme into lessons and projects.

* **Student Volunteers**: Engage student leaders or past participants to promote the program in their classes.

* **Special Events**: Leverage National Arts in Education Week and National Arts and Humanities Month to boost participation.

##### **Community Involvement**

Recruit Volunteers

### Recruit Volunteers

Recruiting volunteers is essential for running the program and your artwork review smoothly. Scope and prepare for recruiting volunteers early to provide enough time to successfully onboard volunteers and use their support in assigning and dividing tasks.

##### **Program Volunteers**

We recommend finding parent and teacher volunteers to support program implementation. Seek 4-6 volunteers (parents, community, teachers). They will enrich your program by bringing a variety of ideas, talents and skills. Assigning project leaders and dividing tasks will also save time and energy. Consider the following volunteer roles:

* **Publicist**: Promote Reflections and share event invites and announcements.

* **Judging Coordinator**: Recruit judges, organize artwork, support judges.

* **Computer Wiz**: Organize entry info, prepare awards, list advancing students.

* **Celebration Coordinator**: Exhibit artwork, prepare awards, lead event activities.

##### Volunteer Reviewers

To facilitate your review, recruit arts professionals in your community or network who can score entries based on the criteria provided, as well we their own artistic experience. Inviting professionals in the arts community will increase the credibility of your program and exposure for PTA. Consider these tips for recruiting volunteer reviewers:

* **Identify Needs**: Determine the number of reviewers needed. Aim for at least one reviewer per category, with extra judges for categories with many entries.

* **Create a Contact List**: Compile a list of potential reviewers, including art teachers, local arts agencies, cultural organizations, colleges, community leaders and prominent artists.

* **Parent and Alumni Networks:** Reach out to with personalized invitations parents and alumni with art backgrounds.

* **Local Businesses:** Partner with art-related businesses.

* **Informational Materials:** As part of promotions and invitations, share high-level details explaining the role, time commitment and the impact they will have.

#### Collect and Review Artwork

  

Collect artwork, required [Student Entry Form](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/fillable-student-entry-form_reflections.pdf "Student Entry Form-PDF") information and any state-specific information Collect entries physically or digitally, based on method that works best for your PTA.  Then, using the [Reflections Review Packet](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-reviewer-packet_eng7d4764f1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf), conduct a fair, effective and efficient review using a group of arts professionals.  
  
To inform your collection and review planning, connect with your state PTA to receive required training, materials or tools to use in collecting entries and use the general resources National PTA provides in the [Reflections Program Resources](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/State-PTA-Reflections-Library/Action/Preview#resources) section above.

Use the dropdown menus below to inform and guide plans for your artwork review.

Key Tips to Plan Collection and Review

### Key Tips to Plan Collection and Review

Start planning your collection and review process early, as it will inform guidance to participants and volunteers. Connect with your state PTA or the next program level (e.g., district, council, region) to clarify specific requirements for formats, processes, and deadlines. Generally, National PTA recommends a digital collection and review process for easier management and preventing loss or damage and ensuring consistent documentation.  
  
Choose a straightforward submission process based on the information you gather. Consider the following to choose your collection and review method(s).

##### Choose How to Collect Entries

Determine if you will collect artwork physically, digitally, or both. Consider the following:

* **Digital Collection:**Consider using email, a digital sharing platform (Google Drive, Dropbox) or a digital entry form. Choose a platform/tool that is familiar to participants. *A template digital entry form is available in the State PTA Reflections Program Resources above.*

* **Physical Collection:**Consider shipping costs and issues with mail delivery and distance from drop-off location to participants. Determine how you will store and return artwork to participants.

##### Choose How to Review Entries

Choose the review format—digital or in-person—based on your entry collection method. If collected digitally, consider how to present physical artwork to reviewers; if collected physically, plan how to digitize the artwork.

PTAs should consider both methods based on what is easiest for participating students and families, as well as PTA volunteers and volunteer reviewers:

* **Online Review**: Collect entries virtually (form, email, digital storage platform) or digitize physical submissions. Organize entries in virtual folders, assign numbers to each to keep anonymous. Share digital copies and scorecards. Score each entry and submit via email or form.

* **In-Person Review**: Collect physical entries, including media entries on USBs, CDs, etc.,) or print out submissions. Display works with titles and artist statements. Show media entries using a tablet or computer. Reviewers rotate and score each entry on scoring sheet found in the [Reflections Review Packet](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-reviewer-packet_eng7d4764f1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf).

##### Plan Your Artwork Review

After determining your collection method, planning for your review is simple! Determine the following elements of your review before launching your program to guide your training to the field:

###### **Review Timeline**

Reviews typically need at least one month for organizing submissions, training reviewers, and handling issues. PTAs should set submission deadlines about a month before announcing winners or advancing entries to the next level.

###### **Review Materials**

As part of your planning, while decisions are fresh in your memory, create a custom review packet that outlines necessary program details and guides reviewers through the process.

* **Clear Directions**: Explain the review process (online login or in-person score drop-off).

* **Judging Criteria**: Share Reflections criteria and emphasize the importance of the theme.

* **Necessary Details**: Provide support materials or context shared with students. Include definitions or requirements about categories and eligibility.

* **Theme Information**: Provide support materials or context shared with students.

* **Entry Details:** Clearly organize and provide the title, artist statement and additional details for each entry.

Core Review Factors

### Core Review Factors

The review process is critical to the success of your program and contains three main elements PTAs should keep in mind throughout the program.

##### **Impartial Judging**

Use “blind” judging to reduce bias by omitting student names and personal information. This is important to avoid concerns with favoritism or other biases. Encourage students to include their name on the back of their artwork or in a way that is *not visible to a reviewer.* Consider the following:

* If the name is handwritten or signed, cover with a small, non-distracting post-it note.

* If entry is digital, save two versions—one with a name, one without.

##### Complete Judging

**Be sure to score *all* entries you receive.** Work with judges who flag an entry for disqualification to ensure the entry is still scored based on the [Reflections Scoring Rubric](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-reviewer-packet_eng7d4764f1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf). Having a standard, numerical score is also helpful in answering and navigating questions or concerns about why certain awards were or were not given.  
  
**Double check all the ways a student may have submitted their entry.** As deadlines approach, check-in with your community to ensure you don't miss submissions at physical drop-off locations, PTA inboxes (email and socials), or any forms used to collect entries.

##### **Reflections Review Criteria**

The arts and arts review process will often have subjective elements, which makes using a standard, consistent review and scoring system necessary to conduct a fair and consistent review. Judges should score entries based on the following Reflections review criteria, as outlined in the [Reflections Review Packet](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-reviewer-packet_eng7d4764f1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf). *National PTA uses the same review rubric in national-level review.*

* **Interpretation of Theme (40 pts.)**: How closely the piece relates to the theme, based on the artwork itself and the artist statement.

* **Creativity (30 pts.)**: How creative and original the piece is in its conception of the theme and its presentation.

* **Technical Skill (30 pts.)**: The level of skill demonstrated in the basic principles/techniques of the arts area.

Steps to Artwork Review

### Steps to Artwork Review

After you’ve planned your process and prepared review materials, you are ready to start the three steps to completing a successful artwork review

##### **Step 1: Prepare Artwork for Review**

Allow time for organizing and qualifying entries for your review to make the overall review process smoother for your PTA and reviewers.

* **Organize Entries**: Group submissions by category and division for your review.

* **Qualify Entries:** Verify entries are eligible for review. Scan and flag submissions that do not follow program guidelines and requirements:
  + Incomplete entry forms (missing information or signatures)
  + Incomplete submissions (missing title, artist statement or additional details)
  + Entries that don’t meet arts category requirements (missing notation, additional photos for 3D visual art)

##### **Step 2: Prepare Reviewers**

Ensure reviewers are well-prepared and consistent in their evaluations by providing the same materials and support through the process. Use the **[Reflections Review Packet](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-reviewer-packet_eng7d4764f1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf)** to foster consistency and host trainings to discuss questions or ideas provided by reviewers.

To conduct the review, your reviewers will need the following:

* **Student Artwork:** Remove or hide identifying information to protect the “blind” review.

* **Student Artwork Information:** Provide the title, artist statement and additional details with judges to help reviewers understand each student’s inspiration for their work and how it relates to the theme.

* **Review Packet:** Judges should easily be able to find review criteria, directions for completing the review and contact information for questions.

##### **Step 3: Collect Scores**

Have judges record their points and share back final scores to be verified.

* **Double check all entries are scored on all criteria.** Review absolutely every entry you receive, regardless concerns about qualification so you have a numerical score, based on the Reflections Scoring Rubric, to use in navigating questions or concerns that arise after awards are announced.

* **Check for ties between entries.** In the case of ties, the entry with the higher score for interpretation of theme wins. Make sure there are no ties to easily pick winners in each division and arts category.

##### Step 4: Find Winners

Add together the points from each judge and rank the artwork accordingly to find your winners. Assign student winners based on the award categories your PTA set based on goals and state PTA requirements.

Remember, if a question is raised about the status or score of an entry, it is the responsibility of the PTA Reflections chairs to address it. Under no conditions may a reviewer be contacted and/or respond to disputes regarding the status and score of an entry.

##### 

Reminders to Advance Entries

### Reminders to Advance Entries

PTAs are encouraged to advance finalists to the next level for additional recognition and, potentially, national-level review.

##### **How to Advance Entries**

PTAs advance entries based on the requirements set by the program next level and/or the state PTA. If you’re unsure how to advance entries, reach out to your [state PTA](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/reflections-state-programs) or the program leader of the next available level.

##### Benefits of Advancing Entries

Moving your finalists forward for additional review opens pathways for students to receive more awards and prizes at higher levels and benefits your PTA in a number of ways, including:

* **Enhanced Visibility:** Your PTA gains recognition within the community and state when students from your school achieve additional honors.

* **Motivation and Inspiration:** Advancing entries can inspire other students to participate and strive for excellence.

* **Community Pride:** Celebrating student achievements at higher levels fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment within the school and community.

##### **Reminders for Advancing Entries**

Reflections Chairs are responsible for advancing finalists for additional review (e.g., district, region, council, state levels) and potentially national level.

* **Connect With State PTA:** Be sure to communicate with your state PTA and/or the next program level that you intend to advance submissions.

* **Clarify State-Specific Rules:** Each state may have specific rules or requirements to consider, be sure to verify eligibility requirements with your state PTA.

* **Consider National Eligibility:** To be eligible on the national level, entries must be advanced by a state PTA and meet requirements set by National PTA. Reach out to your state PTA if you have questions.

#### Recognition and Celebrations

  

Celebrating student achievement provides an opportunity for schools and families to connect with each other and to their community. Prioritize planning and implementing a celebration strategy that effectively communicates with winners and promotes their accomplishments across your community.

Use the dropdown menus below to support your state celebrations.

Announce Winners and Connect with Students

### Announce Winners and Connect with Students

Publicly and widely announcing student winners helps makes the accomplishment more special and exciting for student artists, while connecting directly with student winners ensures they don't miss out on their awards and prizes. 

##### Announce Winners

Publicizing achievements enhances the your state PTA's reputation in supporting the arts. Announce winners and showcase student artworks in various ways:

* **School Announcements:** Morning announcements, intercom, assemblies, marquee or digital sign, posters and flyers and a special section in the yearbook.

* **PTA Announcements:** During meetings or special events, on the PTA website and in newsletters.

* **Community Announcements:** Email blasts to community partners and press releases to local newspapers and radio stations.

* **Digital Announcements:** Banners, video announcements and email blasts to the school community.

##### **Connect with Students**

Help student artists easily find relevant details, by updating webpages and/or social media with details about Reflections winners and awards, such as:

* **Winning Entries:** Clearly indicate student name, award level and other relevant and specific information (e.g., classroom, school/teacher name, artwork title, entry category).

* **Advancing Entries:**Explain what determines if an entry advances and specific which are advancing for additional review.

* **Review Details:**Provide information on upcoming review levels, processes, points of contact, and timelines.

* **Celebrations:**Share details about upcoming celebrations or exhibits.

* **Artwork Return:** Inform students when they can expect their artwork back. Return non-advancing works immediately after judging or exhibition, and no later than the last day of school. Note that electronic submissions are typically not returned. Be mindful of secondary students needing their artwork for college admissions.

* **Next Program Theme:** Share the theme for the next program to inspire students to participate again. Themes are selected two years in advance through the Annual Theme Search Contest. Learn more at [PTA.org/ReflectionsAwards](/home/programs/reflections/awards "Reflections Awards").

Use the dropdown menus below to your efforts to strategically and successfully wrap each program cycle.

Collect and Analyze Feedback

### Collect and Analyze Feedback

The key to hosting an efficient and impactful Reflections program is collecting and using feedback from key audiences to inform decisions and processes you make as a Reflections Chair. This ensures you're program is best serving the students, families and schools. 

##### Methods to Collect Feedback

Use surveys or listening sessions to gather feedback from your community. Find questions and prompts to guide feedback collection, in this [Program Assessment Tool](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/reflections-program-assessment_eng.pdf). Customize the questions based on your program and consider the following methods to engage your community:

* **Digital Surveys**: Deploy a digital survey in wrap-up communications to participants and reviewers or after your celebration event.

* **Paper Surveys**: Provide paper surveys during celebration events or in the front office with feedback boxes to collect responses.

* **Listening Sessions and Interviews**: Organize focus groups and conduct one-on-one interviews with key program supporters to gather in-depth feedback.

##### **Evaluate Feedback**

Meet with your Reflections Committee to review feedback and consider the following steps:

* **Analyze Feedback**: Categorize feedback (participation, event organization, communication, overall satisfaction). Identify common themes, specific comments and recurring issues (e.g., logistical challenges, communication gaps).

* **Document Successes**: Record what worked well (e.g., high participation, positive event feedback, successful promotions).

* **Develop Action Items**: List specific actions to address improvements. Assign responsibilities and set deadlines (e.g., improve registration, enhance promotions, support volunteers).

Share Your Successes

### Share Your Success

Just as publicizing state and national winners enhances the your state PTA's reputation in supporting the arts, promoting data-based takeaways and themes that show your state's overall success is important to continuing and expanding the reach of your program. 

##### How to Promote Program Successes

Compile data and visuals (artwork, videos, theme materials) into a report or presentation to share with your community, school leaders, state PTA and National PTA to showcase the program's success and its positive impact. Here are some ways to measure your success:

* **Participation Numbers**: Provide statistics on student participation, broken down by categories and divisions.

* **Celebration Attendance**: Report the number of attendees at your celebration events to show community engagement.

* **Quotes from Families**: Share testimonials from students, parents and teachers to capture personal testimonies about the program's positive impact.

* **Visual Highlights**: Create a slideshow or video montage featuring student artwork and award presentations.

* **Success Stories**: Emphasize individual achievements of students who advanced or received special recognition as well as accomplished volunteer judges.

* **Community Impact**: Highlight how the program fostered pride and mention any local business or organization partnerships.

* **Educational Connection:** Show how Reflections supports educational goals and integrates with the curriculum. Mention teachers who used Reflections in their classroom.

Plan for Next Year

### Plan for Next Year

It is never too early to plan for future program cycles, to ensure Reflections remains available to young artists in your community. One of the biggest hurdles National PTA sees in state Reflections programs, is a lack of continued planning and connection between each program cycle. To avoid this, states should intentionally plan for the next cycle as part of the program wrap up.

##### Early Program Promotion

Connect with Teacher and School Leaders to share the upcoming Reflections theme. This provides time for planning and exploring alignment with curriculum and/or other opportunities in your school community. Each Reflections theme is selected two years in advance through the Annual Theme Search Contest and outlined at [PTA.org/ReflectionsAwards](/home/programs/reflections/awards "Reflections Awards").

##### Ensure a Seamless Transition

One of the biggest hurdles National PTA sees in state Reflections programs, is a lack of continued planning and connection between each program cycle. To avoid this, states should intentionally plan for the next cycle as part of the program wrap up.

Wrap up your PTA Reflections program by collecting all materials, planning documents and contact lists. Organize everything so the next state Reflections chair can easily access and use them. Document and share your experiences to help guide future leaders.

* **Be Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and short sentences to make your documentation easy to understand.

* **Organize Information**: Structure your documents with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy navigation.

* **Use Templates**: Create or use existing templates to maintain consistency across documents.

* **Provide Context**: Explain the purpose of the document and any background information needed to understand it. Include examples to clarify complex concepts or procedures.

* **Make it Accessible**: Ensure your documentation is easily accessible to those who need it, whether digitally or in print.

###
