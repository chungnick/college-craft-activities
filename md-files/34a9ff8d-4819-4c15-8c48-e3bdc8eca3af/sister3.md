## Explore the Arts and *Express Yourself*

##### This program is for students of all grades and their parents and caregivers.

National PTA has a long-standing commitment to arts education. For over 50 years, Reflections has helped students explore their own thoughts, feelings and ideas, develop artistic literacy, increase confidence and find a love for learning. The Reflections program provides opportunities for recognition and access to the arts which boosts student confidence and success in the arts and in life.

Each year, hundreds of thousands of students in pre-K through grade 12 create original works of art in response to a student-created theme. In Reflections, students submit artworks in the available arts category areas and program divisions: Primary (Pre-K - Grade 2), Intermediate (Grades 3-5), Middle School (Grades 6-8), High School (Grades 9-12), Accessible Arts (All grades welcome).

### Frequently Asked Questions

  

Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about the National PTA Reflections program. Please remember that submission and participate guidelines are determined at the state PTA level and may vary by state. Please review your [state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines) or contact your [state PTA office](https://www.pta.org/home/About-National-Parent-Teacher-Association/PTA-Leadership/state-offices) with specific questions.

General Questions

##### What are the deadlines to participate?

**Each state PTA determines its own process and deadlines for Reflections submissions, so deadlines vary by state.** Begin by connecting with your local PTA, and for further support visit your [state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines "State Reflections Program") to find specific submission timelines and participation guidelines.

##### What is Reflections registration, and how do I do it?

By registering your participation in the Reflections program, you are helping National PTA show the reach and impact of the program. **Registration is separate from participation**. To participate in Reflections, students and local PTAs must follow the process and requirements outlined by their state PTA. Registration opens April 1 at [PTA.org/Reflections](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections) and runs until Feb. 1 of the following year. *Due to the high volume of registrants, you will not receive a confirmation email.*

##### What do the national Reflections award winners receive? When will you announce the awardees?

State-winning Reflections submissions that advance to the national level go through two rounds of review by arts professionals from across the country. Through the review, o**ver 200 student Reflections participants are selected for recognition with the following awards from National PTA: Award of Merit, Award of Excellence and Award of Outstanding Interpretation**. The national awardees are announced on **May 1** and are celebrated throughout the following calendar year. Learn more  at [PTA.org/ReflectionsAwards](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/awards).   

##### Does National PTA require PTA membership to participate in the Reflections program?

The Reflections program is an opportunity made available to students through local PTA units. **Students are eligible to participate according to the requirements, including membership, set by their state PTA.** National PTA does not accept individual entries. Contact your [state PTA office](https://www.pta.org/home/About-National-Parent-Teacher-Association/PTA-Leadership/state-offices) with eligibility questions and visit your [state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines "State Reflections Program") for details to understand what options for participation are available to your family.

Participation Questions

##### Should I put my name on my Reflections artwork?

It is strongly recommended that Reflections reviews are blind—where judges only see basic entry information such as the title, artist statement and, as necessary, the student’s age. As such, **the student’s name and/or other identifying information should not be visible on or within the **artwork**that will be judged.**Things to avoid include adding a credit scrolls in Film entries, recording introductions in a Music entry recording, providing a by-line in Literature entries. Student information will be collected through the required Student Entry Form.

##### What are your guidelines on using technology and software to create entries?

**Digital technology and/or software can be used to develop, enhance and/or present an entry but may not provide the primary design and/or concept.** Entrants must provide a brief description of the tools and method, including any generative elements. Additional state program requirements or exclusions may apply. Refer to your [state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines "State Reflections Program") to ensure that you are participating in the program per their requirements.

##### Can a participant submit Reflections artwork created with a friend, teacher and/or adult?

Reflections encourages and recognizes individual creativity, so **entries must be the creative product of the student artist alone.** National PTA will recognize only *one student*as the award recipient for an entry, and they should be the primary creator of the piece—especially, the interpretation of the theme and the execution of the piece. **Other individuals may appear in or perform a student’s work, but **help **from an adult or collaboration with other students is not allowed.******For specific questions regarding eligibility, refer to your [[state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines "State Reflections Program")](/home/programs/reflections "Reflections Homepage") to ensure that you are participating in the program per their requirements.

##### Can I submit an entry in a language other than English?

Students for whom English is not their first language may submit entries in their own language. However, **an interpretive translation in English must accompany the entry**. Translators should make every attempt to retain the same level of language and accuracy that is reflected in the student’s original work.

##### What are your guidelines on copyrighted materials?

**The intention of the Reflections program is to encourage and showcase *original artwork* created *by the student* in response to the annual theme.** Use of copyrighted material, including any copyrighted cartoon characters, copyrighted recorded music or copyrighted photographs, stock images or material downloaded from the internet, is not acceptable, except for the following:

* Entries may include public places, well-known products, trademarks or certain other copyrighted material as long as that copyrighted material is incidental to the subject matter of the piece and/or is a smaller element of a whole. The resulting work cannot try to establish an association between the student and the trademark/business/material or influence the purchase/non-purchase of the trademarked good.
* If background music is used in dance choreography and film production entries, it must be cited on the entry form. Use the Additional Details field to cite the title, composer, performer and/or the library or digital platform used. If certain details are not available, include as much general credit as possible to indicate that the materials are not the student's own creation.
* Visual arts, photography and film production entries may include portions of existing copyrighted works, such as photographs, magazine or digital media clippings and/or type cut out of a newspaper, as long as those portions of copyrighted works are used to create a completely new and different work of art.

For specific questions regarding copyrighted materials, refer to your [[state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#guidelines "State Reflections Program")](/home/programs/reflections "Reflections Homepage") to ensure that you are participating in the program per their requirements.

Accessible Arts Questions

##### What is the Accessible Arts division?

The division (previously the Special Artist division) was created in 2012 through collaboration between a PTA volunteer committee and arts professionals with expertise in disability advocacy in the arts. The Division offers division-specific accommodations to students who identify as having a disability and may receive services under IDEA or ADA: Section 504 to ensure every student has the chance to participate fully in the program. By participating in the division, students compete against other students in the Accessible Arts Division and are awarded as part of the division. To learn more visit our [Craft an Entry page](/home/programs/reflections/craft-an-entry "Craft an Entry"). For specific questions, refer to your [state’s Reflections website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections#:~:text=Connect%20and%20Create%20with%20Your%20State%20PTA "State Reflections Program")to ensure that you are participating in the program per their requirements.

##### Why did the Accessible Arts division change names?

In April 2024, National PTA launched the Accessible Arts division as the replacement title for the Reflections Special Artist division. This change is in response to concern around the term “special” and based on feedback gathered from participants, volunteers and partner non-profit organizations. **Moving forward with the title Accessible Arts division recognizes the importance of evolving how we talk about disability to align with and be more inclusive of people with disabilities**.  

##### I am supporting a student artist who is non-speaking and/or with limited language. How can they title their entry or write their artist statement without assistance?

They don’t have to do it alone! While prioritizing the student’s original ideas and concepts as reflected in the artwork they can provide collaborative support, guidance, etc. to help the student complete their piece and meet eligibility requirements. However, an assistant should not independently select a title or write the artist statement. Our guidelines indicate the following:

* While the artist directs the process, assistants (a parent, teacher, other adult) may help with executing the artist's vision with typing, transcribing, etc.

We also recommend using the Additional Details section of the entry form to share context that highlights the student’s creative direction and how the assistant supported the process. The following is outlined in the division guidelines:

* Use the “Additional Details” field to provide details about how the student’s disability and/or support needs impacted their entry (10 to 100 words, optional).

##### Within the division, when may students select grade-level division aligned to their support needs, rather than age?

Usually, students should enter the division that matches their current grade. Choosing a division based on support needs is meant for students with complex support needs or those over 18 who are still receiving school-based services and supported by a PTA.

If a different division feels more appropriate, the student, their family, and PTA leaders should talk it through and agree together. The division selected still be as close to the student’s actual grade level as possible and appropriate. For example, the student over 18 would select the high school division, or a freshman in high school might select the middle school division if appropriate. Exceptions can be made, but they should be intentional and clearly communicated among all parties involved.
