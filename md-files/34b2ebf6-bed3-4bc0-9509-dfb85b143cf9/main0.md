# Analytics Academy

## Summer 2025 Pre-College Program

Bentley's Analytics Academy is a week-long pre-college program for rising juniors and seniors in high school and offers a unique opportunity to explore the vast potential of data and gain insights into the world of data sciences. Through engaging with guest speakers and hands-on learning, students can develop practical skills and knowledge while working on a capstone project, allowing them to apply their newfound abilities in a real-world setting.

The program's emphasis on creating a fun and positive learning experience ensures that students not only acquire valuable data analytics skills but also enjoy the journey of discovery and exploration. Courses will be offered on campus this summer.
