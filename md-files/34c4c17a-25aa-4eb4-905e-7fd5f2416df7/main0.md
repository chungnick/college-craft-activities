## YTI Online

| --- | --- |
| YTI Online is a program that meets weekly for one hour but is **currently on hiatus**. Often we focus our conversations around a book we read together that we provide to you. Group members decide how we proceed and what we read.  ​This is a time and space where you can get support from adults who relate to you as equals and where you can ask any and all questions you have about God, the Bible, the world, any questions you are carrying with you. | [Let us Know here if you are interested ​in joining our next cohort](https://yti.formstack.com/forms/yti_online) |

**Examples of Questions You Might Bring to YTI  
  
At YTI we believe all questions are important and that asking them is essential to a healthy faith. There is no limit to what you might explore with us, but below are a few examples of questions youth like you have explored at YTI.**  
  

* What is the bible and how can I go about understanding what it says?
* How should I relate to other faiths?
* Why do bad things happen?
* How do I decide what justice is?
* How can I make the world better than it is right now?
