| Application Deadlines  **US applicants applying regular decision** should have all of their application materials submitted no later than **March 1, 2026**. They will be notified of their status by April 1, 2026.  ​We look forward to receiving your application!  ---  The Youth Theological Initiative, founded in 1993, is a place where diverse teenagers experience college campus life while exploring their questions about God, faith, and the world. YTI is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience deep belonging in the midst of diversity. YTI scholars come from a vast spectrum of theological views and racial and cultural backgrounds.  YTI is not like school and it’s not like “church camp.” For two weeks, youth live with other teens and caring adults in an intentional community on Emory’s campus. We learn in uniquely engaging ways. We play, we hang out, and we worship together.  We believe that teenagers are already-whole human beings, living in some of the most important years of their lives. This is why we introduce youth to theological skills often reserved for seminary. Together we ask hard questions about why the world is as it is and how we can change it.  After the Summer Academy, over 1,200 YTI scholars have gone on to make the world better in countless ways. Our alumni have become activists, ministers, professors, scientists, writers, you name it. One YTI scholar was part of a team that won the Nobel Peace Prize! Regardless of what they go on to do in the world, alumni often say that the YTI Summer Academy was a turning point in their lives where they started on the path of finding their purpose and a deeper understanding of themselves, God, and the world.  ​You do not need to believe anything in particular to come to YTI. In fact, no two scholars or adult mentors ever believe the exact same things. YTI is simply a place where you can come and ask your own questions, learn from others through community, and leave with deeper clarity about your own faith. We work to ensure that everyone belongs at YTI.

[What happens in a day at yti?](/what-do-you-do.html)  ---  [Apply here](https://yti.formstack.com/forms/2026_yti_summer_academy)  ---    **Hear about YTI from a recent participant:**  ​ "I was blown away at how deep into conversations we would dive, asking questions students usually wouldn’t think to ask in a normal classroom. I felt a sense of camaraderie as we spent more time talking and diving into concepts that you wouldn’t even think about if you weren’t pushed. It’s a time I don’t think I could ever forget.   The way I look at life has completely changed. I’m much more intentional in my thinking and interactions with the people around me, interpreting, analyzing and examining people’s words, actions and demeanor. ...Now, I give people my respect and try to do good by them, regardless of who they are.  **...**I learned that I have a duty as a young person to contribute my energy to those who need it most: those within my community.  **...**I feel more sensitive to what’s going on around me and I’m able to communicate my thoughts more effectively than I used to.  The best thing for me is that they break the typical hierarchy of teacher and student. Rather, they come with the notion of “we are all here to learn together and learn from each other.” I believe that’s what encouraged me to be able to be open and expressive about what I was thinking, which helped me have the best experience that I could." |
