[Q: Are international students eligible to apply?](#dropdown-box-4)

A: Yes! NYU Precollege has many great courses for international students. International students are required to provide proof of English language proficiency as part of their application. You’ll find information about language and visa requirements [here](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/high-school-and-middle-school-programs/high-school-programs/nyu-precollege/application-information/international-students.html), but if you have questions, contact University Programs at university.programs@nyu.edu.
