[**Tuition & Charges**](#tuition) | [**Example Costs of Attendance**](#examplecosts) | [**Billing & Payment**](#billing) | [**Financial Aid**](#financialaid)

If you are registered for classes, you are responsible for all costs associated with your courses.

**Please be aware, if you enroll in courses and decide not to participate, you must notify the [Visiting Student Advising Team](/admissions/visiting-students/admitted-students/Academics-and-advising.html) by the appropriate deadlines so that you are no longer responsible for the costs.**

### Tuition & Charges

Tuition is charged per course credit (or unit). The cost of attendance is based on the total number of credits in which a student enrolls. Students enrolled in 12-18 total credits in the Fall and Spring terms are charged a flat tuition rate. The number of credits a course is assigned can vary, however the typical NYU course is worth 3 or 4 credits.

Non-credit course options are available during the Summer, and the cost of such non-credit courses is individual to the course. Students are encouraged to research non-credit courses of interest to learn more.

### Example Costs of Attendance

The following are example tuition charges. Students may use the [NYU Bursar Tuition Calculator](/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/tuition-and-fees.html) for a more accurate estimation of tuition charges based on their course registration and total credits in a given term.  In addition, some courses may have added charges for lab or studio costs.

#### **Living on Campus**

Students interested in the cost of living on campus may find [housing rates](/students/student-information-and-resources/housing-and-dining/on-campus-living/application-and-assignments/rates-and-payments.html) and [dining rates](/students/student-information-and-resources/housing-and-dining/dining/nyu-meal-plan/washington-square-meal-plans.html) online.

##### Attending Online

Online courses taken at NYU may be subject to tax within your home country, and we highly recommend that students consult their home academic institution regarding taxation.

### Billing & Payment

An electronic bill will be sent to your NYU email account once you have registered for your courses. Your bill must be paid in full by the payment deadline, or you risk being de-enrolled from your courses. In the case of overpayment, the balance is refunded. Learn more information about [Billing & Payments](/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds.html).

### Financial Aid

NYU Financial aid is not offered to visiting students. However, the below funding options are available. Note: Any financial aid that a student arranges may not exceed the total cost of attendance.

#### Consortium Agreement

1. Students enrolled at another college or university must contact their home school's financial aid office to inquire about receiving aid via a consortium agreement with NYU.
2. Students may then email a completed consortium agreement to the [NYU Office of Financial Aid](/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships.html) at [financial.aid@nyu.edu](mailto:financial.aid@nyu.edu) with the subject line "Consortium Agreement."
   * Please include the student’s NYU ID number in the email and on all pages of the consortium agreement.
   * Please allow up to 3 weeks for processing time.
3. The NYU Office of Financial Aid will send the consortium agreement back to the student’s home school, so their financial aid may be processed.

#### Private Loans

Students not currently enrolled at another college or students unable to arrange aid via consortium agreement may be eligible for private loans.

* We encourage visiting students to borrow no more than necessary for educational expenses.
* NYU does not endorse, recommend, or prefer any particular private loan over another.
  + Note that loan terms and eligibility requirements can vary, so we highly recommend [exploring if non-federal private loans is appropriate](/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/types-of-aid/private-loans.html).
  + Students may also find helpful a [list of lenders](/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/types-of-aid/private-loans/private-lenders.html) who have issued private education loans to New York University.
* Students may apply for a private loan via the lender's website.
  + Credit approval is usually necessary, and some loans are not available to visiting students.
  + The loan period for a private loan should be the dates of the term a student is attending NYU.
  + NYU will certify a private loan with a lender based on the student’s course enrollment. Please allow up to 3 weeks for processing.
