## First Contest of the 2025-26 Season

Our first contest of the 2025-26 season has recently ended. Results are being compiled
and will be available soon.

## Important Note on Division Assignments

As discussed below, we will be implementing changes this year as
we transition towards an updated structure for our contests and
possibly also our divisions (bronze, silver, etc.). As part of these
changes, we are moving all competitors currently in platinum into the
gold division for the start of this competition season (the only
students who will remain in platinum to begin this season are our 2025
IOI finalists as well as former finalists who performed at a
comparable level in the past season). Our top competitors should
therefore view their goal this season as earning promotion to platinum
as well as a strong combination of certified gold and platinum scores
to be invited to the final proctored contest.

For those wondering what this change means for the future, we
anticipate that our contest structure will likely end up being more
like the other major scientific Olympiads where accolades are
independently earned on a yearly basis rather than the way things are
currently set up, where a single promotion to platinum guarantees
platinum standing forever. There are many details still to work out;
please be patient until these are announced later. For those who have
written "platinum division" on things like college applications that
have already been submitted, that is of course fine, although moving
forward please include the competition year (e.g., "platinum division
in the 2024-25 season") to be more accurate in light of these
anticipated potential changes in structure.

## 2025-2026 Competition Schedule Released

Our 2025-2026 competition season will be structured slightly
differenly from past years, with three on-line contests in early 2026
followed by a proctored invitational championship contest. The online
contests will follow the same format as past online contests, with
gold and platinum results being "certified" (carrying greater weight)
when a competitor starts the contest within the first 15 minute of
opening (Saturday noon Eastern time during the larger 4-day contest
window). Top USA competitors from the online contests will be invited
to participate in the final proctored contest; detailed logistics for
this are still being worked out and will be announced later. Results
from the proctored contest will determine who is invited to our 2026
camp as a finalist, as well as the four individuals who will represent
the USA at the 2026 EGOI (this year the EGOI is held prior to our
camp, necessitating an earier selection process; the EGOI team and top
EGOI prospects for future years will still be invited to our camp for
training).

This year will be somewhat transitional as we gain experience with how
to most effectively implement our final proctored contest. The same
(bronze, silver, gold, platinum) division structure will remain in
place this year for stability, but this may possibly be tweaked
slightly in the future to place more emphasis on yearly results
stemming from the final proctored contest.

To recap the details about "certified" contest results: In the gold
and platinum divisions, problems will be first released at 12:00pm
(noon) eastern time (ET) on the Saturday of the larger Friday-Monday
contest timeline. Any student who begins the contest between 12:00pm
and 12:15pm ET on that day will receive a *certified* score
(treated by USACO staff as having higher potential credibility and
weight than a non-certified score). Certified results are only
possible in gold and platinum; the bronze and silver divisions will
run as in the past, with problems available at the beginning of the
Friday of the contest timeframe. In order to promote from gold to
platinum, your score must be certified. In order to earn an
invitation to our final proctored contest, USA-based students should
have at least 2 and ideally 3 certified scores from on-line contests
this season (USACO coaches will consider any exceptional situations
outside these parameters on a case-by-case basis).

## Excellent Results at 2025 IOI and EGOI

Congratulations to the USA team for their strong results at IOI 2025
in Bolivia: Brian Xue (silver), Alex Chen (bronze), Bing-Dong Liu (silver),
and Rain Jiang (gold).
Congratulations as well to Pearl Yu (bronze), Helen Law (gold), Luna
Hudman (gold), and Grace Li (gold) for their outstanding results while
representing the USA at 2025 European Girls Olympiad in Informatics in
Germany!

## 2024-2025 Finalists Announced

The USACO is pleased to announce its [finalists](index.php?page=finalists25) for the 2024-2025
season, all invited to participate in our training camp in late May to
compete for selection for the USA teams attending the International
Olympiad in Informatics and the European Girls Olympiad in
Informatics.

## Our Mission

The USACO supports computing
education in the USA and worldwide by identifying, motivating, and
training high-school computing students at all levels. We provide:

* Hundreds of hours of free on-line [training
  resources](index.php?page=training) and historical contest problems (complete with solutions) that students can use to improve their programming
  and computational problem-solving skills.
* On-line programming contests (four
  per year) for students at all levels.
* An intensive summer training camp, to which the top students in
  the USA are invited to further improve their skills and learn
  advanced material.
* The opportunity for the top four students in the USA to
  represent their country at the [International Olympiad in
  Informatics (IOI)](https://www.ioinformatics.org), the most prestigious international
  algorithmic programming competition at the high-school level. We
  also select a team of the top four female high-school students in
  the USA to compete at the [European Girls'
  Olympiad in Informatics (EGOI)](https://egoi.org), a competition of similar
  prestige modeled after the European Girls' Mathematical
  Olympiad.

We are indebted to our amazing volunteer staff and to our sponsors for
their support of our mission.
