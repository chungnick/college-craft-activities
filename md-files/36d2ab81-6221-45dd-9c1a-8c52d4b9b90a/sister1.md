## On-Line Contests

The USACO holds web-based algorithmic programming contests during
the academic year, usually four total, from December through early
spring, one per month. The final contest is the US Open, carrying
more weight and serving as our national championship exam. Contests
usually run for four continuous hours in length for a normal contest,
and five for the US Open. For maximum flexibility, you are free to
schedule this block of time anywhere within a Friday-to-Monday contest
weekend --- your timer starts when you log into the contest and
download the problems. Contest tasks are presented on the web, and
you submit your final solutions through a simple web
interface.

Participation is free and open to all. Pre-college / USA students
are typically ranked separately from "observers" (all others
participating). There is no pre-registration required to compete; all
you need is an account on this site. During the Friday-Monday
timeframe of an active contest, a button will appear on our homepage
that will take you to the contest page, where you can see additional
details about the contest and click another button when you are ready
to start.

Contests are offered in four divisions:

* **Bronze**, for students who have recently learned to program,
  but who have no training in algorithms beyond basic concepts like
  sorting and binary search.* **Silver**, for students who are beginning to learn fundamental
    problem-solving techniques (e.g., recursive search, greedy algorithms)
    and fundamental data structures.
  * **Gold**, where students encounter more standard algorithms of
    a more complex nature (e.g., shortest paths, dynamic programming) and
    more advanced data structures.
  * **Platinum**, for advanced students who are well grounded in
    algorithmic problem-solving techniques, who wish to challenge
    themselves with sophisticated and more open-ended
    problems.

All participants start in the bronze
division, and those who score particularly well in a contest will be
promoted to the next division. Contestants with a *perfect*
score will be automatically promoted to the next division while a
contest is running; in this case, if interested, they can click to
start the contest in the next division (with a full clock) during the
same Friday-Monday timeframe. Others will need to wait until results
are announced at the end of the contest to see if they meet the
(contest-dependent) cutoff for promotion.

Detailed technical specifications and rules for our contests are
available [here](index.php?page=instructions).

An archive of many years worth of historical contest problems is
available [here](index.php?page=training). These come with
solutions and the ability to submit code to have it judged for
correctness. If you have never competed in a USACO contest, you may
want to practice with a few of these problems first, in order to gain
some familiarity with problem style and the submission system on this
site, before embarking on a timed contest.

Note that we have recently introduced the notion of a
*certified* contest result for some divisions (currently platinum
and gold), obtained by taking the contest in a specific common time
window when problems are first released. In these divisions, problems
will be first released at 12:00pm (noon) eastern time (ET) on the
Saturday of the larger Friday-Monday contest timeline. Any
student who begins the contest in these divisions between 12:00pm and
12:15pm ET on that day will receive a *certified* score, treated
by USACO staff as having higher potential credibility and weight than
a non-certified score. A certified result is required for promotion
from gold to platinum, and at least 3 certified scores are required
for consideration as a finalist invited to our summer training camp.
If you are competing in bronze or silver, do not worry yet about this
extra complexity, as certified results do not apply to those
divisions; bronze and silver contest problems are available during the
entire Friday-Monday timeline.

## The Road to the IOI and EGOI Teams

Based on the results of the web-based contests throughout the year
(with particular emphasis on the US Open), approximately two dozen
students are invited as "IOI finalists", to a rigorous academic
training camp in the early summer, hosted at Clemson University,
culminating in the selection of 4 of them to represent the USA at the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). Joining them at camp are
a cohort of top female USA students, invited as "EGOI finalists", who
are selected according to the same criteria and who participate in the
same training program. These students, along with any female IOI
finalists, are contending at camp for positions on the 4-person team
to represent the USA at the European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics
(EGOI). The IOI and EGOI are held in different countries every year
and are generally regarded as being among the most prestiguous
computing contests in the world at the pre-college level. At camp,
many more contests, advanced lectures, and a full schedule of
additional computing-related and extracurricular activities fill out
the week of activities.

To be eligible for selection as an IOI or EGOI finalist and
ultimately as an IOI or EGOI team member, you must be enrolled in a
high school (or junior high/middle school) for at least one semester
in the school year before the IOI / EGOI. You can concurrently take
courses at other institutions, including colleges and
universities. You must either be a US citizen or a resident of the USA
during the first half of the school year. IOI team members from
countries other than the USA are not eligible to be USACO finalists
(and this includes students who have made commitments to other
countries that could conceivably result in their being selected for an
IOI team prior to USACO camp).

To be selected as a finalist, you must excel in your participation
in USACO web-based contests through the year. Students in their
senior year, and finalists from previous years generally face a
stricter set of criteria for selection than younger / newer students.
Students who miss contests during the year are also potentially at a
disadvantage in terms of competitiveness.

Expenses for the USACO training camp are paid by the USACO,
although participants are asked to fund their own transportation to
the camp. For the IOI and EGOI, all expenses, including
transportation, are paid by USACO. We are immensely grateful to
our sponsors for allowing us to support these activities.
