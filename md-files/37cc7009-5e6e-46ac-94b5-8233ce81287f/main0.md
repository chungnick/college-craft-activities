# Advanced Computational Biology Camp for High School Students

## June 22-26, 2026 (Mon-Fri)

## In this research camp, students will identify cancer biomakers and categorize cancer samples using microRNA expression data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Students will also learn to research using machine learning packages in R.

This camp provides statistical methods in the context of disease research. It is for current (2025-26) high school and exceptional 8th grade students who want to learn computer programming for future biomedical applications. R is a statistical tool and programming language with excellent graphic options, useful in various application areas such as medicine, public policy, and economics. After R is introduced, the students will assess current biomedical problems and identify useful tools for research.

The R Programming Camp is not just a programming camp; it provides essential tools and datasets with which students can develop their own research projects. Students will learn TCGA big data analysis using microRNA sequencing data of cancer patients. We will use an R machine learning package during the camp. Finally, students will learn to generate scientific graphics useful for professional presentations such as in publications and at science fairs.

## Campers learn to generate these types of graphs

**DATE:** June 22 – June 26, 2026 (Mon – Fri)

**TIME:** 10 am – 5 pm, Eastern Time (7 am – 2 pm, Pacific Time; 9 am – 4 pm, Central Time)

**LOCATION:** University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI or Virtual (running together with the UM camp)

**INTENDED AUDIENCE:**Academically motivated current (2025-26) high school and exceptional 8th grade students interested in computers, math, science, and medicine.

The Advanced Computational Biology Camp is open to students with or without coding experience, as students with similar experience will be grouped together. It uses the R programming language, building from the ground up. Curiosity and and open mind are essential for learning this material. You will have multiple teaching assistants supporting you throughout the camp.

This camp requires active engagement both in learning and in group games and other activities. Please register for this camp only if you can commit to such engagement throughout the camp.

**FAQ:** How are the Advanced Computational Biology Camp and the Computational Biology Camp related?

The Advanced Computational Biology camp (previously known as the R Programming Camp) is a research camp that utilizes the R statistical programming language. The Computational Biology Camp focuses on more holistic research concepts. Therefore, taking the CB camp will enhance the experience of the Advanced Computational Biology camp, and is encouraged to be taken first.

**TUITION**:

     University of Michigan in-person camp: $875

     Virtual camp: $610

Students will receive a **$80 discount** for each additional camp purchased beyond the first.

Among the camps, only CB camp participation will qualify for the miRcore volunteer program. If you have not taken CB camp previously (including one in 2026 summer), this camp alone will not provide qualification for the miRcore volunteer program.

*After reviewing your essay in the application form, we will inform you regarding acceptance within 7-10 business days. If accepted, you will be sent payment options. **Limited partial scholarships are available for financially-challenged students such as those in free or reduced lunch program. Proof of income is required.***

*A computer with internet connection is required to join the online camp.*

**APPLICATION FEE**: $75

**Friday**

Each group will present research project with a program developed throughout the week.

**Refund Policy**

– The $100 administrative fee will not be refunded once the camp application is accepted.  
– If a student withdraws, the camp fee paid minus the administrative fee will be refunded if we are notified by May 31, 2026.  
– If a student withdraws between June 1, 2026 and two weeks before the camp starting date, we will refund 50 percent of the camp fee paid.  
– Refunds will be given until two weeks before the camp starting date.
