1. Why non-profit?

This is the main question people ask when they learn of our search for disease biomarker or causes of disease. As nobody owns a non-profit organization, any surplus should be used only for the purpose of the organization, which in the case of miRcore is “to advance science and medicine.” Our nonprofit status helps to minimize outside influences, thus avoiding compromise of our vision by financial motives. Our status reflects our commitment to supporting innovation genetic research in a transparent way.

2. What is the meaning of miRcore?

Most microRNAs have individual names starting with miR. We envision serving as a core facility helping the scientific community conduct miRNA research. However, we distinguish miRcore from a conventional core facility, since our main goal in each case is to generate new hypotheses rather than only conduct data analysis.

3. What are the objectives of miRcore?

The objectives of miRcore are to perform microRNA research supporting scientists, doctors, and patients, and to fund new genetic research steered by the public. Even if your genetic research does not contain microRNAs, we can still help advancing the research through our unique microRNA “lens”, which will focus on highly relevant marker genes without bias to the previously known knowledge.

4. What is microRNA?

MicroRNA (miRNA) is a newly identified genetic entity which acts as a gatekeeper to protein production of other genes.

5. Why study microRNA?

It is an ideal biomarker and a key regulator for genes. Not only is miRNA detectable in urine, but a single miRNA can regulate 200 genes. In addition, cancer cells have low amounts of miRNAs, so studying them is far easier than studying the entire genome. These functions may ultimately provide the key to integrating genomics and proteomics, and personalizing medicine.

6. How do you pronounce GIDAS?
