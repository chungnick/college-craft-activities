This summer engineering course introduces high school students to the fundamentals
of digital electronics and physical computing through hands-on use of the Arduino
Microcontroller . Students learn how digital systems work by exploring binary logic,
inputs and outputs, and microcontroller-based control. Through guided labs, they gain
experience programming the Arduino, wiring electronic components safely, and using
digital and analog signals to read sensors and control outputs such as LEDs, buzzers,
and displays. No prior programming or electronics experience is required, making the
course accessible while still technically rigorous.  
  
As the week progresses, students apply these fundamentals to real-world engineering
challenges involving motors, driver boards, and sensors. They learn how to safely
control DC motors and servo motors using motor driver circuits, implement decision-making
logic in code, and integrate multiple components into a single system. The course
culminates in a student-designed final project such as a smart device, automated mechanism,
or sensor-based system that reinforces problem-solving, teamwork, and engineering
design principles. By the end of the program, students leave with practical skills,
confidence in working with electronics, and a clear understanding of how software
and hardware work together in modern technology.
