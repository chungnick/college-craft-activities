You can fit Oakland University tuition into your budget—and we can help.

Since our founding in 1957, Oakland University has made affordable tuition a major priority, including [tuition-free opportunities](/tuition-guarantee/) for those who qualify. The whole community benefits when first-class education is accessible to everyone.

The Oakland University financial aid team can use a wide range of tools to help you meet the cost of OU tuition. Our advisers offer personalized attention to help you design a sustainable plan for paying OU tuition that:

* Supports your educational goals.
* Fits your short-term budget and long-range financial needs.
* Integrates multiple sources of financial aid.
* Won’t leave you with unmanageable debt.
* Minimizes hassle and maximizes convenience.

## Types of OU Financial Aid

More than half of our students receive financial aid to help them cover some or all of their Oakland University tuition. We disburse more than $150 million each year in financial aid, with the average award exceeding $7,000 per student per year.

[OU financial aid is available in various forms](https://www.oakland.edu/financialaid/available-financial-assistance/undergrad/), including:

* Scholarships, which are based on academic merit and do not require repayment.
* Grants, which are based on financial need and do not require repayment.
* Loans, which are based on financial eligibility and must be repaid after graduation.
* Work-study jobs and campus employment.

Determining your eligibility for all forms of OU financial aid begins with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. You can complete the FAFSA online at fafsa.ed.gov, using OU’s school code (002307) to ensure the paperwork is routed correctly.

Priority deadlines for scholarships and financial aid eligibility have been extended. OU will now award new students through the start of fall classes.

OU scholarships and grants may be renewable if you meet the Oakland University [scholarship and grant renewal criteria](https://oakland.edu/financialaid/available-financial-assistance/undergrad/index). Download the [2026-2027 Financial Aid and Scholarship Book](/media/Oakland/Assets/Financial-Services/files/ADM-28552_FinancialAidBooklet_FINAL_ADA.pdf). Scholarship details are listed below.

[Tuition](#tabbed-content-59765)

While you don't need to worry about any hidden fees at Oakland, you should consider other costs of attending college such as living arrangements and textbooks. The cost of books and supplies will vary depending on the courses you take, but a general estimate is $784 per year. See OU's [cost of attendance](https://www.oakland.edu/financialservices/costs/ "cost of attendance page") for more information and estimates.

OU's cost [per credit hour](https://www.oakland.edu/financialservices/costs/ "link to costs page") differs depending on your residency and class standing. Many out-of-state students (including citizens of Canada and Mexico) qualify for a scholarship that covers the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition. See the [scholarship tab](https://www.oakland.edu/futurestudents/scholarships-cost-aid/#tab-1 "Cost and Aid") for more information.

Students who plan to attend Oakland University on a student visa (F-1) or an exchange visa (J-1) should check the [tuition and cost tab](https://www.oakland.edu/futurestudents/apply/international/#tab-3 "Apply") in the international section of this website for prospective students.
