# Tuition and Cost of Attendance

At Oakland University, you can take advantage of all the opportunities of a doctoral research university without the cost of one — and without any hidden fees. In fact, OU is the only public university in Michigan that doesn’t charge fees.  
  
We have just one price: the cost of tuition. What you see is what you pay.
