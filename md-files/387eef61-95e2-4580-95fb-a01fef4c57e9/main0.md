"The High School Media Workshop meant a lot to me and was definitely a huge part of my final decision to attend Ohio University. I already wanted to attend OHIO before the program, but the week on campus over the summer really drove it home that this was the right choice. The program introduced me to some awesome people (some of which I’ve been friends with since the program ended) and amazing opportunities that the Media School offers, like the OHIO-in-LA program, which I’m currently participating in."  -**Cade Evans, senior integrated media major** (attended workshop as a high school student)

"The High School Media Workshop really showed me what the major was going to actually be like. It also helped me to meet some of the faculty that I would end up having as professors. I was pretty sure I wanted to go to OHIO before the workshop but it was really just the icing on the cake that really solidified my choice!" -**Grace Fowler, senior integrated media major** (attended workshop as a high school student)

"The workshop really cemented the idea of a hands-on production education with the School of Media Arts & Studies. I made friendships and connections that led me to choose Ohio University and the Scripps College of Communication as the obvious choice for my career in creative video!" -**Andrew Pohlod, senior integrated media major** (attended workshop as a high school student in 2017)

"The workshop was really helpful, I liked how varied the projects were. Was fascinating to have so much hands on creative experience while still in high school, it definitely led me to pursue more creative endeavors in my future." -**Gabriel Antonuccio, junior integrated media major** (attended the workshop in 2017)
