# Exploring media, finding direction

OHIO’s High School Media Workshop immerses aspiring creatives in hands-on production while building community and confidence in future media professionals.

From collaborative production sessions to late-night editing and campus adventures, Ohio University’s [High School Media Workshop](https://www.ohio.edu/scripps-college/media-arts-studies/high-school-media-workshop) (HSMW) offers students a packed schedule of hands-on learning and immersive experiences.

Over five days, participants dive into sessions like digital cinematography, animation and audio engineering while enjoying social events, team building and life in the residence halls. With activities ranging from a campus tour and group dinners to a final Sunday showcase of original projects, the workshop blends creative development with a real taste of life at OHIO.

## Creative futures begin here

From the moment they stepped onto campus, the high school students from across the country who attended the HSMW were treated like budding media professionals. Students gained more than just technical skills at the workshop; they also found community, mentorship and a glimpse into their future.

The weeklong residential program, hosted by the [School of Media Arts and Studies](https://www.ohio.edu/scripps-college/media-arts-studies), invites high school students to explore a variety of production paths, including video, animation, audio for cinema and music production. With access to professional equipment, university studios and one-on-one guidance from OHIO faculty and current students, participants walked away with polished projects and new confidence.

“I love being able to help high school students find their creative voices!" said Andie Walla, associate professor and HSMW director. "The High School Media Workshop gives them a great picture of what it's like to attend OHIO as a MDIA major. Students get hands-on experience and the chance to create something as a team."

Walla has been involved with the program since 2016, first as an instructor. She moved into the director position in 2021.

Jennifer Poland, a music recording instructor, explained that workshop participants "recorded a multitrack live performance of a four-piece band, demonstrating their dedication and teamwork.”

All skill levels are welcome at the workshop, and all participating students are given room to grow.

"Even though skill levels were diverse, everyone stretched themselves, learning, communicating, and growing as a team to bring their creative visions to life,” said Chelsea Clark-Besic, an animation instructor.

Each track emphasizes a hands-on, exploratory approach. In the video production session, students brainstormed original ideas, captured footage using industry-standard cameras and edited their work in OHIO’s digital post-production labs. Music and audio students worked on soundboards and mixing software to produce multi-track compositions, while animation participants used professional editing tools to bring their illustrations to life.

Beyond the tech, what stood out to many participants was the opportunity to connect with like-minded peers and experience the energy of college life. Students lived in residence halls, dined on campus and collaborated with their teams well into the evening, which mirrors the pace of real-world creative environments.

> I would 100% recommend the HSMW to any student considering OU for their future or a media path of any kind, as it is a great introduction to the resources and experiences offered to students at OU and in the professional world
>
> Alex Karan, junior music production student

## Pathways to the future

The impact of the workshop often stretches far beyond a single week. Many former attendees, now enrolled in the [Scripps College of Communication](https://www.ohio.edu/scripps-college/), credit the program with shaping their decision to attend Ohio University. The experience not only provides exposure to the college environment but also introduces students to the resources and possibilities waiting for them in the School of Media Arts and Studies.

“I loved learning about how movie cameras work and how to edit videos!” said workshop attendee Mackenzie Klein.

Her mom, Jenny Klein, reflected on Mackenzie's experience.

“The High School Media Workshop inspired Mackenzie to consider careers she didn’t even know existed!" Jenny Klein said. "The staff working at the camp were inspiring and kind. We are grateful for their contribution to Mackenzie’s learning.”

Alex Karan, a junior majoring in [music production](https://www.ohio.edu/scripps-college/media-arts-studies/undergraduate/music-production-recording-industry), said the workshop influenced his decision to pursue a career in the field.

“Participating in this year's HSMW as a counselor was very special for me because I attended the workshop as a student the summer before I started at OU,” Karan said. “It played a huge role in my decision to pursue a career in music production, and I am sure that it can help many young students make the same decision for themselves.”
