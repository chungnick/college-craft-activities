# Biology: The Science of Cells and Innovation

Cells are fantastically complicated, dynamic packages of life that we still poorly understand. What recent discoveries are revolutionizing our understanding of cells? What’s the connection between cell organization and human diseases? How do scientists use the tools of microscopy to further advance their knowledge? Get answers to these questions, dive into the world of cells, learn their language, and discover how new technologies are allowing us to not just better see, but also feel cells. Whether you’re looking to receive college credit or just immerse yourself in the world of biology before college, we have an option for you.

## Immerse Yourself in the World of Biology

### Learn the Cellular and Multicellular Frameworks.

Uncover where all the information about cells in textbooks comes from. Understand how scientists discover new things about cells and how they organize and relay this knowledge.

### Cover the Basics of Cells and Structure.

Recognize the wide diversity of cell functions and structures. Apply basic chemistry and physics principles to explain what limits the size and shape of cells.

### Delve Into Microscopy: Seeing Cells.

Identify microscopes that are commonly used by biologists and define their function. Determine which microscope is best to answer various questions and learn to recognize their limitations.

### Study the Blobs and Globs of Cells: Flipping the Paradigm.

Unravel recent discoveries greatly altering our understanding of cell organization. Learn to describe the core chemistry and physics principles at play in molecular interactions in water.

### Discover Biomolecular Condensates in Medicine.

Gain insight into the four different disease states. Deepen your understanding of basic cell functions like gene expression, cell signaling, and division. Study how disease results from functional aberrations.

### Explore College Majors and Future Careers in Biology.

Topics covered in this course offer a vital background for college majors and potential career paths: everything from science to medicine to epidemiology and more. This course is also great for students interested in technology, patent law, and journalism.

## How You Will Benefit

* Know how to analyze why and how cells organize their contents.
* Be able to compare and contrast what we’ve traditionally known about cells against recent discoveries.
* Be able to discuss the idea of scientific epistemology, specifically how scientists learn about cell organization using the tools of microscopy.
* Gain knowledge about cutting-edge biological discoveries that are changing how we see the relationship between cells and illness.
* Complete a Final Capstone Project to demonstrate what you’ve learned.
* Earn a Certificate of Completion or College Credit from Georgetown University.
