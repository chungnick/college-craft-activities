## Gain original, cutting-edge research experience

The nationally known Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program (ASSIP) provides transformative research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. Selected participants work one-on-one with faculty researchers at George Mason University and collaborating institutions using state-of-the-art technology across many disciplines.\*

## The 2026 ASSIP application is now OPEN. [Click here to apply.](https://gmu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eR8ELq4J9yIK66W) Applications will be accepted through Sunday, February 15, 2026.

**What's next for 2026 ASSIP applicants?** 2026 ASSIP applications will be processed during February 2026. In early March, prospective mentors will review applications and select some applicants for interviews. Mentors' internship offers will be extended by the first week in April.  All applicants will receive notification of their status during the second week of April. For accepted interns, the 2026 internship cycle will begin with an orientation on June 18 and culminate in a final poster session on August 12, 2026. 

**About ASSIP:**

As part of your 8-week (June 18-August 12, 2026), full-time ASSIP internship, you will:

* Gain hands-on experience using cutting-edge sophisticated equipment and technologies,
* Develop and exercise scientific writing and communication skills
* Explore STEM career choices through discussion forums and meetings with role models
* Develop and exercise creative skills, crucial to performing innovative research
* Earn three college credits from George Mason University

**Eligibility:**

**Minimum ages:** Interns for **remote internships** must be 15 years or older by June 18, 2026. Internships for in-person or hybrid internships in computer labs must be 15 years or older by June 18, 2026.

Interns for **"wet-lab" in-person or hybrid internships** must be 16 or older by June 18, 2026. This is a requirement by Mason Environmental Health and Safety and no exceptions can be made. "Wet labs" are those in which chemicals, biohazards, mechanical or electrical risks, or other risks may be present. Mentors who can only accept interns who are 16+ years old are noted on the Prospective 2026 ASSIP Mentors Tab.

**Maximum age:** There is no maximum age limit, as long as the applicant has not graduated from university  before or during their internship. 

**Benefits of summer research internships and tips on applying to ASSIP:**

A significant body of data supports the importance of STEM students engaging in summer research experiences. Summer-long research allows students to make meaningful contributions to society at a young age, and to participate in STEM practices that promote student STEM content understanding, skills, and STEM self-identity and self-efficacy. Summer research experiences contribute to STEM student persistence in a college degree which can, in turn, lead to fascinating, meaningful, and well-paying careers.

"My experience at ASSIP for the last two summers was probably the most beneficial and impactful experience I have had in my life so far. It taught me how to be a better scientist and engineer, how to develop new ideas, and how to make those ideas a reality. I accomplished a lot that I never thought I was capable of doing as a high school student such as filing for three patents and inventing new technologies to be used by companies to help others. The ability to see that my work has the capability of helping others and that I can make a difference, even as a high school student, has given me the confidence I need to continue innovating."
