**The costs associated with ASSIP participation include a $25 nonrefundable application processing fee, and a $1299 tuition fee for accepted interns. Applicants with financial need can request a fee waiver code to waive their application fee and their program tuition.**They can email [**cosassip@gmu.edu**](mailto:cosassip@gmu.edu)and provide a current copy of their free/reduced lunch eligibility (high school students) or Pell Grant Aid letter (university students).

For safety and liability reasons, applicants**must be 16 years old or older as of the first day of the program**each year if they are working in a laboratory with biological or chemical hazards. For all other internships, applicants must be 15 by the first day of the program.Students may participate in the program for a total of two summer sessions.

Mentors select their internship formats-remote, in-person, or hybrid (some in-person and some remote). Some mentors are flexible on internship format based on the candidate. All mentors report the internship format they plan to offer on their pages in the “[Prospective 2026 ASSIP Mentors](https://science.gmu.edu/assip/prospective-2026-assip-mentors)” tab.

Research laboratories for in-person and hybrid format internships are located at George Mason University's Science and Technology Campus (Manassas, VA), the Potomac Science Center (Woodbridge Campus), or the Fairfax Campus. Students are responsible for their transportation. Usually, non-Mason interns may purchase low-cost general parking permits for use during ASSIP. ASSIP interns may ride [free Mason shuttles](https://transportation.gmu.edu/shuttles/) which provide transportation throughout the area and between Mason's Fairfax and Manassas Campuses. Program hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.to 5 p.m., for 30 hours/week except for June 19 and July 3 when the university will be closed.

We are likely to be able to arrange reasonably-priced campus housing for students 18 years and older at the start of the program; students must pay for that housing.  We are unable to arrange campus housing for minors. The program begins with a required orientation and training on Thursday, June 18, 2026. The internship concludes with the required annual ASSIP Research Symposium and Celebration on August 12, 2026.

A letter of recommendation is notrequired and will not be accepted during the initial review process. Transcripts are neither requested nor accepted.
