## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to pay to participate in the program?

Generally, yes *(this is a change from previous years).* This program costs $1299 in George Mason tuition for the 8-week summer experience. Following successful completion of the program, including meeting course expectations and deliverables, interns will receive 3 credits of COS120: Introduction to Research. The tuition paid for this course does not cover lunches, housing, or travel expenses (ASSIP is not a residential program). This tuition is only charged following an internship position offer, and your acceptance of the internship offer. Read more about the implementation of ASSIP for [college course credit, and browse additional FAQs](https://science.gmu.edu/assip/assip-tuition-and-fees) related to the course credit. In addition, a $25 application fee is required when applying to the program. 

*To ensure that your family’s financial situation doesn’t disqualify you from participation, we can waive both the tuition and application fees for students who are eligible for free/reduced lunch assistance or eligible for Pell Grant financial aid. Reach out to*[*cosassip@gmu.edu*](mailto:cosassip@gmu.edu) ***prior** to submitting your application to share your free/reduced lunch documentation or Pell Grant award documentation and receive your fee-waiver code. Please do not let concerns about payment stop you from considering the program; we want to work with you to ensure that anyone who is accepted into ASSIP based on the merit of their application is able to join us for ASSIP 2026.*

### Where are the Science and Technology (formerly Prince William), Fairfax Campuses and Potomac Science Center of George Mason University located?

See map at <https://info.gmu.edu/campus-maps-and-directions/>

### Is housing available for summer interns?

We may be able to arrange affordable dorm housing  for students 18 and older; students must pay for their housing. We are unable to provide housing for minors.  All students are responsible for their own transportation but may use the[free Mason shuttle service](https://transportation.gmu.edu/shuttles/) which has some routes around the area and between Manassas and Fairfax Campuses and the Vienna Metro.

### My student cannot be present for a week, month, etc of the session/needs to start late/ end early/miss orientation/go visit relatives for a week/ miss the poster session-can they still participate?

Full participation in the entire program is necessary.

### My student is not a US Citizen nor a permanent resident. May I still apply?

Yes, but a few research labs may be unavailable for non-US citizens. We do not serve as sponsors for Visas for international students.

### How and when are candidates selected?

Applications are reviewed by participating mentors during the last part of February. Candidates are scheduled for interviews to be conducted in March. Students are notified of mentors who select them as interns by early April. Students are expected to accept offers by mid-April. Although all applications are reviewed by mentors, it is not likely that every applicant will be interviewed by a mentor.

### Do I need to submit a letter of recommendation to complete my application?

Applicants do not need to submit a transcript or a letter of recommendation with their application. We may ask for one or both of those if we have questions, but that is rare.

### Can I select a mentor to work with?

Students are highly encouraged to list up to 3 faculty mentors of interest.  ASSIP does not place interns. Rather, mentors select their research interns to interview and then participate based on  the student's application and their expressed interest in the mentor's research. Learn more about our [**Prospective 2026 ASSIP mentors.**](https://science.gmu.edu/node/110419)

### What hours will I be working?

In general, ASSIP mentors expect interns to work normal business hours of 9:00 to 5:00 pm on Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal or state holidays including Juneteenth on Wednesday, June 19th, 2026 and Independence day on Tuesday, July 3rd, 2026. *All prospective interns should confirm the hours expected of them during the interview process, particular remote interns who may reside in disparate time zones from their mentors.*

### How old do I have to be to participate in the program?

**Eligibility:**

**Minimum ages:** Interns for **remote internships** must be 15 years or older by June 18th, 2026. Internships for **in-person or hybrid internships in computer labs** must be 15 years or older by June 18th, 2026. 

**Interns for "wet-lab" in-person or hybrid internships** must be 16 or older by June 18th, 2026. This is a requirement by Mason Environmental Health and Safety and no exceptions can be made. "Wet labs" are those in which chemicals, biohazards, mechanical or electrical risks, or other risks may be present. Mentors who can only accept interns who are 16+ years old are noted on the “Prospective 2026 ASSIP Mentors” Tab.

**Maximum age:** There is no maximum age limit, as long as the applicant has not graduated from university during their internship.

### How many times can I participate in the program?

ASSIP interns may participate in ASSIP a total of 2 times.

### Will lunch be provided?

Students are responsible for their own lunch. Several restaurants are located on/next to the Science and Technology Campus and there are multiple food choices on the Fairfax Campus for students who wish to purchase lunches. Potomac Science Center students must bring their own lunch.

### Are internships remote, in-person or a hybrid format?

Each prospective mentor, when signing up for an ASSIP session, reports whether they will accept only in-person, only remote, or hybrid (some in-person work, some remote work during an average week) interns. Some mentors are willing to flexible based on the specific intern. Each mentor’s choice is reported on their page in the [2026 Prospective ASSIP Mentors tab.](https://science.gmu.edu/assip/prospective-2026-assip-mentors)
