## Prepare for the Future while Enjoying the Summer

CTD's Academic Day and Residential Camps for students grades 6-12 (entering grade in fall 2026) offer high-achieving, motivated middle and high school students the opportunity to receive high school, college-level and pre-professional instruction from master teachers and industry leaders. Fast-paced, intensive courses engage students in critical and creative problem solving as they grapple with advanced concepts in subjects from math and science to writing and technology to leadership and service-learning, producing products such as writing portfolios, original iOS apps, or community action plans.

### **Why Choose CTD's Academic Camps?**

Master instructors, community partners, and industry experts support students as they explore possible career paths. Community with like-minded peers from around the country and across the globe provide the inspiration and support needed to stretch and grow. CTD participants develop their individual talents as they learn how to make positive change in their communities. In addition, residential camps immerse students in the beautiful lakeside campus of Northwestern University. Residential camp programming emphasizes the formation of life-long friendships and the independence needed to succeed at university and beyond. 

### Benefits include:

* Small class sizes and individual attention
* Opportunities to network with a a global community of peers
* Preparation for high school, college, and career

**Students whose MyCTD profiles are not already at the**[**Indigo Tier**](///eligibility)**in the stated qualifying area or areas may demonstrate eligibility by ONE of the following methods:**

* Students may apply with their grade report/unofficial transcript and our online teacher recommendation form if test scores are not available.

#### **Prerequisites**

A few courses require additional prerequisites for admission. Any prerequisites are included the course description. Any student applying to a course with a prerequisite must submit documentation showing the prerequisite has been met unless CTD already has such information from previous applications, or if the prerequisite has been met via a CTD course.

### **Advanced Enrichment Courses**

Three-week, advanced enrichment courses are at the [Magenta](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/eligibility) eligibility tier. Please make sure to thoroughly read the admissions requirements. 

**Students whose MyCTD profiles are not already at the**[Magenta Tier](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/eligibility) **in the stated qualifying area or areas may demonstrate eligibility by ONE of the following methods:** 

* Students may apply with their grade report/unofficial transcript and our online teacher recommendation form if test scores are not available.
* Students may apply by submitting grade-level scores, **achieved within the last two years**, at 95 percentile or above in the stated reading or math qualifying area, on a nationally normed achievement test (e.g. NWEA/MAP, iReady, ACT, SAT, PSAT, etc.).

### **One-Week Enrichment and Civic Education Program Courses**

*Due to service learning/volunteer site age requirements, Leadership for Today requires students to be 12 years old by the first day of the program.*

One-week enrichment courses are at the [**Emerald**](///eligibility) eligibility tier. Please make sure to thoroughly read the admissions requirements in the individual course descriptions.

### **English Language Proficiency**

Because courses are taught in English, test scores are used to assess proficiency and assist in course placement. TOEFL (or TOEFL Jr. for grades 4-8) or IELTS scores are required for students applying with an admission portfolio for whom English is not the first language, do not attend school where at least half their instruction is in English, and who do not have PSAT, I-Excel, SAT, ACT, ASSET, or PreACT scores.

### **Requests for Grade Advancement/Acceleration**

Since students apply to summer programs based on the grade they will enter the following fall, acceleration requests for summer are very rarely approved.  If an acceleration request for summer is granted, it is almost always due to a clear academic need for an advanced math class (e.g. Precalculus for a student not yet in 9th grade). Visit the [Requesting an Accelerated Placement](///request-accelerated-placement)web page for more information about the process, timeline, and required materials.

Residential Life

Residential students follow the same Daily Schedule as listed below. In addition, they have access to all Afternoon Activities, which are specifically required for Grades 6-8. All meals are included in the tuition. Students eat on campus in one of Northwestern’s Dining Halls. In the evenings, students enjoy dinner and wrap up with dedicated study time and floor meetings.  

**Travel to Campus** 

See a [Northwestern Evanston campus map](https://www.northwestern.edu/admissions/visiting-campus/maps-parking.html).

Northwestern University’s Evanston campus is [readily accessible by car, rideshare, train, bus, and taxi](https://www.northwestern.edu/admissions/visiting-campus/). CTD is responsible for students from the time they check in on Opening Day until the time they check out on Closing Day and is not responsible for students traveling to or from campus, except for students using the shuttle service. 

**Weekend Experience**

Residential students enjoy structured weekend activities. Saturdays feature off-campus excursions, while Sundays offer on-campus programming. Off-campus excursion admission and entrance fees are covered in residential tuition fees. Students are welcome to bring pocket money for snacks or souvenirs.  

After arriving on campus, students complete a survey to indicate their excursion preferences. Past outings include museum visits, amusement and water parks, professional sporting events, Chicago tours, outdoor recreation, and theater performances. 

Learn about CTD's residence life learning outcomes [here](https://nuwildcat.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/SESP-StaffSharedFolders/CTD%20Shared%20Folders/Families/Summer/2026%206-12/CTD%20Residence%20Life%20Learning%20Outcomes.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=3KrX2i),

**Roommates**

It is a Center for Talent Development policy that we do not accommodate roommate requests. In our experience, doing so prevents students from getting the most out of the Summer Program experience. 

Roommates are assigned based on age and gender. Geographic location and course enrollment are also considered. Most students share a room or suite with one to three other participants.  

**Standard of Supervision**

CTD’s standard of supervision is (1) students are never alone, and (2) staff members are always aware of students’ whereabouts. As the program works with students of various ages, this standard is applied differently across each program/grade band.

Opening and Closing Day

Please note the following timeframes for **Opening and Closing**:

Student Evaluations and Transcripts

All students who successfully complete CTD Academic Summer Day and Residential Camps receive a brief narrative evaluation that includes comments on the student’s performance in class, grade and credits earned (if applicable), [service-learning hours for CLI students](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/cep-service-hours), as well as recommendations for future study. Residents also receive a brief narrative evaluation that includes comments on community membership and contributions. These evaluations are available starting in September.

**Summer 2026 academic summer camp transcript schedule:** 

Students who have completed a for-credit CTD summer course and have requested an official course transcript can expect to receive that in mid October. Transcripts will be mailed by October 1, 2026.

Students who need to verify their final grade for their for-credit courses prior to receiving their official transcript can request a provisional grade report. Please note that provisional grades are available upon request within one week of the end your students program closing date. Provisional grade reports can be requested by emailing [ctd-summer@northwestern.edu](mailto:ctd-summer@northwestern.edu).

If you have a question about whether a transcript was requested for your student’s application, please email [ctd-admissions@northwestern.edu](mailto:ctd-admissions@northwestern.edu).

Community Health & Safety

The health and safety of our students and staff has always been CTD's top priority. This year is no exception. Families are strongly encouraged to monitor their students for symptoms of illness, keep sick students at home, and get them tested for communicable illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19, and strep throat.

While on campus, students diagnosed with contagious illness (e.g. influenza, COVID-19, chicken pox, etc.) that will take multiple days to resolve, or students who sustain a fever for more than 36 hours, or who experience sustained episodes of vomiting or diarrhea will return home in the care of the family within 24 hours of receiving notice from CTD staff. Families may authorize an adult designee to take their student home.
