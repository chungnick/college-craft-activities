# Eligibility

## Eligibility

CTD offers a variety of courses for enrichment and acceleration, which allow students to master content above and beyond what is traditionally offered at their grade level. The variation in course types allows students to develop their talents to the fullest and to have fun, engaging learning experiences in environments best suited to their current needs and learning goals. Descriptions of the different types of courses and eligibility tiers are found below.    
  
CTD accepts test scores or an admission portfolio for most courses with eligibility criteria. If a student applies using test scores, program staff reserves the right to request additional information to make an admissions decision.

Course types

## Choosing the Right Course

### Advanced Enrichment Courses

Advanced enrichment courses help students delve deep into topics and fields that are not part of the core curriculum at school. Courses are designed to place greater emphasis on higher order thinking, facilitate creative thinking and provide earlier exposure to more advanced concepts in developmentally appropriate ways. Each course experience enables students to focus on building skills and competency in an area of passion. Courses are not graded nor do they offer credit upon completion.

Advanced enrichment courses are offered at Amber (open enrollment), Emerald, or Magenta eligibility tiers. See below for descriptions of each tier and any related eligibility criteria. Examples of programs that offer advanced enrichment courses include, but are not limited to, Online Family Program, Online Core Essentials, and Weekend Enrichment.

### Accelerated Courses

Accelerated courses help students progress through their education at a rate commensurate with their ability, allowing them to access advanced content faster or at ages younger than the norm. Many of CTD's accelerated courses are also credit-bearing. As an [accredited institution](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/accreditation#:~:text=CTD%20has%20been%20accredited%20through,as%20a%20Nonpublic%2DSupplementary%20school.), CTD issues high school credit to students successfully completing Honors and AP courses. However, acceptance of credit from CTD is a local school decision.

Accelerated courses are offered at the Magenta and Indigo eligibility tiers. See below for descriptions of each tier and the eligibility criteria. Examples of programs that offer accelerated courses include, but are not limited to, Academic Summer Day and Residential Camps at Northwestern, Accelerated Summer Online, Online Honors, and Online Advanced Placement.

## Amber Tier | Open Enrollment

Amber Tier courses are open enrollment, which means no documentation is required for eligibility to participate. These enrichment courses encourage students to think deeply and creatively and to learn to problem-solve. They are an introduction to the CTD learning environment and a chance to delve deeper into interesting topics. 

### **Eligibility**

No test scores or portfolio materials needed to enroll.

## Emerald Tier

Emerald Tier Advanced Enrichment courses give students opportunities to focus on specific areas of study within a community of like-minded peers. Students delve deep into topics and fields which are not typically a part of the core curriculum at school. Courses place greater emphasis on higher-order thinking, facilitate creativity, and provide exposure to advanced concepts in developmentally appropriate ways.

### **Eligibility**

1. Report card or transcript and teacher recommendation (Admission Portfolio). You will need to provide the teacher's name and email during the application completion process. OR
2. 90th percentile or above on a nationally normed, standardized grade-level achievement test (e.g., MAP, STAR, etc.), OR
3. Participation in above-grade-level testing through [CTD above-grade-level assessment](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/above-grade-level-assessment) or similar program, OR
4. Successful completion, within the past two years, of a previous CTD course at the same or higher admission tier and in the qualifying subject area.

*See individual course descriptions for qualifying subject areas and any prerequisites.*

## Magenta Tier

### **For Enrichment Courses**

Magenta Tier Advanced Enrichment courses offer the same type of content as Emerald Tier Advanced Enrichment courses but present considerably more content in a compacted timeframe. Instruction is faster paced, which many advanced learners need and want. For example, a course may teach content typically presented over nine or more weeks in only three weeks.

### **Eligibility**

1. Report card or transcript and teacher recommendation (Admission Portfolio). You will need to provide the teacher's name and email during the application completion process. OR
2. 95th percentile or above on a nationally normed, standardized grade-level achievement test (e.g. MAP, STAR, etc.), OR
3. Participation in above-grade-level testing through [CTD above-grade-level assessment](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/above-grade-level-assessment) or similar program, OR
4. Successful completion, within the past two years, of a previous CTD course at the same or higher admission tier and in the qualifying subject area.

*See individual course descriptions for qualifying subject areas and any prerequisites.*

### **ForAccelerated Courses**

Magenta Tier Accelerated courses provide rigorous, high school honors and Advanced Placement (AP®) content to students, earlier than typically introduced in most schools. Courses range from traditional subjects to more specialized elective topics, introducing students to potential college majors and career paths. Students in accelerated, credit-bearing courses receive grades and may earn one or two semester-equivalent high school credits from CTD for successful completion of a course.

### **Eligibility**

1. Report card or transcript and teacher recommendation (Admission Portfolio). You will need to provide the teacher's name and email during the application completion process. OR
2. 95th percentile or above on a nationally normed, standardized grade-level achievement test (e.g., MAP, STAR, etc.), OR
3. Participation in above-grade-level testing through [CTD above-grade-level assessment](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/above-grade-level-assessment) or similar program, OR
4. Successful completion, within the past two years, of a previous CTD course at the same or higher admission tier and in the qualifying subject area.

*See individual course descriptions for qualifying subject areas and any prerequisites.*

## Indigo Tier

Indigo Tier Accelerated courses are intensive, rigorous, high school honors and Advanced Placement (AP®) courses offered to younger students and/or taught in a highly compacted timeframe. These courses allow students to access advanced coursework several years earlier than is typical in schools. For some courses, instructors are compacting a semester or full year of curriculum into a shorter timeframe, often in as few as three weeks. 

### **Eligibility**

1. Report card or transcript and teacher recommendation (Admission Portfolio). You will need to provide the teacher's name and email during the application completion process. OR
2. [Requisite scores](/requisite-scores) on an above-grade-level test through [CTD above-grade-level assessment](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/above-grade-level-assessment) or similar program:
   1. PSATTM 8/9, SCAT, or I-Excel test taken in grade 5 or 6 (if applying as a student in grade 7 or 8)
   2. ACT® or SAT® test taken in grade 6, 7, 8 or 9, OR
3. [Requisite scores](/requisite-scores) on ACT, SAT, PreACT®, or PSAT/NMSQT® test taken in grade 10 or 11, OR
4. Successful completion, within the past two years, of a previous CTD Indigo Tier course with the same qualifying subject area criteria.

*See course descriptions for specific score and subject area requirements and course prerequisites.*

## Assessments

One path to establishing eligibility for CTD courses is using test scores, either grade-level test scores or above-grade-level test scores. Grade-level tests are those typically administered by schools to measure readiness for or mastery of content designated for the student's grade level. Students who participate in CTD's above-grade-level assessment program (formerly NUMATS) or similar programs take tests typically given to older students. These tests, which provide more challenging content, are good predictors of readiness for advanced and accelerated coursework. Learn more about assessment options through CTD, below.

Students from India, UAE, Kuwait, or Singapore, interested in above-grade-level testing, or who have already tested with ASSET Talent Search, please visit the [ASSET Talent Search page](https://www.assettalentsearch.com/).

[### **Grade-Level Assessments**

CTD provides testing to help determine a child’s readiness for CTD’s advanced enrichment classes and to provide insights into emerging academic strengths. If you need information about your child's learning needs, CTD may be able to help. Remote testing options are available.](/grade-level-assessment)

[### **Above-Grade-Level Assessments**

CTD provides testing to help determine a child’s readiness for advanced classes and to provide insights into academic strengths and abilities. Examples of tests that have been given above-grade-level include the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT), Iowa AssessmentsTM, the PSATTM 8/9, the SAT®, and the ACT®. Through CTD, students can take some of these nationally and internationally recognized tests above their grade level to receive in-depth information about their strengths and inform decisions about their schooling.](/above-grade-level-assessment)

## Requesting an Accelerated Course Placement

CTD courses are already advanced or grade-level accelerated, as reflected in course descriptions and the standard admission requirements. Course instructors also routinely differentiate instruction as appropriate.

Still, for some students demonstrating a need for an even higher level of instruction than CTD’s advanced and accelerated courses already provide, further acceleration may be an option.

CTD has developed a procedure for evaluating students for possible accelerated placement into CTD courses designed for older students.

Visit the [Requesting an Accelerated Placement web page](/request-accelerated-placement) for more information about the process, timeline, and required materials.
