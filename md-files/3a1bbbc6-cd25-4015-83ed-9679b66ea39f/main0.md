# Business Opportunities Summer Session (BOSS)

Information about the Business Opportunities Summer Session (BOSS).

2026 BOSS will be held June 14-26, 2026

The 2026 BOSS application will open on October 20, 2025, and close on March 20, 2026.

> I had the privilege to BOSS 2025. Throughout the two weeks on campus, BOSS gave our group rare access to top Penn State professors, industry experts, and various business operations. It took us beyond the classroom, allowing us to see EY’s corporate environment and how places like DelGrosso's amusement park or a baseball stadium operate. I enjoyed our hands-on learning components from the business pitch group presentation to learning to tie a tie with Dr. Campbell. The program opened doors, clarified my path, and connected me with people who both challenged and inspired me. I’m especially thankful for the friendships I formed and the team that made everything possible. They created an environment I would return to in a heartbeat. I highly recommend it to any student who is serious about finding their place in a business career. ~**Alexia Purkanto, BOSS Participant 2025, York, PA**

**BOSS (Business Opportunities Summer Session)** is a **two-week, residential summer program** held at **Penn State’s University Park campus**, only for **high school juniors** from the **U.S. and Puerto Rico** and interested in pursuing a business education in college.
