## About the Competition

The Diamond Challenge, a philanthropic education initiative by [Horn Entrepreneurship](https://www.udel.edu/horn) at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/), provides free resources for students, educators, and entrepreneurship practitioners. Participants learn from new ideas and create, submit, and present original business and social venture concepts. The Diamond Challenge leadership team can modify or eliminate competition rules at any time.

##### 

#### RULES, TERMS & CONDITIONS

##### Application Requirements

1. Teams must consist of 2-4 high school students aged 14-18 at the submission deadline. Each team is required to have one adult advisor aged 21 or older. While multiple advisors are allowed, only one can be included in the official team submission. Contact information, including email addresses, must be provided for all team members, including the adult advisor. Each student may participate on only one team and submit one concept per competition year.
2. Upon initial submission, each team is required to choose a competition track (business innovation or social innovation) as well as a pitch round format (live pitch event or virtual/pre-recorded). Selections are considered final upon submission.
3. **Competition Track**
   1. **Business Innovation:** a concept’s primary purpose is to solve a customer problem, that by doing so will generate revenue and profit.
   2. **Social Innovation:** a concept’s primary purpose is to solve a social problem and make a positive impact on people or the environment.
4. **Pitch Round Format**
   1. **Live Pitch Event:** Participants can choose to pitch their project at a live event. These events are hosted at various locations around the world in collaboration with Pitch Event Partner organizations. Typically, events are held in-person though the determination of the event format is at the discretion of the Pitch Event Partner. A participant from a team must be present at the event to compete.
   2. **Virtual/Pre-Recorded:** Alternatively, participants have the option to compete virtually by uploading a pitch deck and a recorded video pitch for judging. This option allows participants to pitch remotely without attending an event.
5. Throughout the competition, participants must avoid listing or disclosing the names of their schools unless the school constitutes a critical element of their concept.
6. Only concepts created by members of the team may be submitted. If a submission has also been conceived by members not participating in the Diamond Challenge, their full legal names must be disclosed during submission to avoid potential conflicts of interest and/or potential legal challenges at later stages of the competition.
7. Concepts must not have generated more than $100,000 in total revenue prior to the submission deadline.
8. Concepts that have advanced to the final round (Summit) in prior years cannot be resubmitted.

##### Submission Round Requirements

To enter the Diamond Challenge competition, participants are required to complete an initial submission that consists of two components:

1. **Written Concept Narrative:**
   1. Persuasive concepts can be expected to tell a seamless and compelling story about: the problem being solved, the customers/beneficiaries who have the problem, how the problem is being solved (i.e., a description of the product/service), why the solution is different and better than existing alternatives (i.e., its unique value), the basic economics underlying how it will make money (or sustain the social venture), the collective means of the team members for pursuing the venture, and any evidence gathered to show positive progress (or gaining customer-problem-solution traction).
   2. The narrative is limited to 3-5 pages, double-spaced, utilizing a 12-point font and a 1-inch (2.54 cm) margin. Cover pages are not to be included. Pages over the stated limit will be removed. All submissions are to be written in English. Documents should be submitted in a .pdf format.
2. **Introductory Video:**
   1. A compelling video serves as a concise introduction to both the team and the concept being submitted. The video should present the team members’ names, the concept name, and a brief yet impactful explanation of the problem the concept aims to solve, for whom and the proposed solution.
   2. The video is strictly limited to 60 seconds. Videos must be submitted as a publicly accessible URL link. Videos exceeding the time limit or unavailable to be viewed will be disqualified.
3. Written concept narratives and introductory videos serve as a submission requirement solely during the first round of the competition.
4. Teams who participate in the submission round will be evaluated by a series of judges and must meet the minimum score to advance to the pitching round.
