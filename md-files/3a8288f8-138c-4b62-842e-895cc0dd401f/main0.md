    We reserve the right to revoke the registration of any child who consistently disrupts normal activities and does not abide by the [Rice Code of Conduct](https://sjp.rice.edu/code-of-student-conduct). While this is a rare occurrence, it is important to note that consistent disruptions diminish the experience of the other participants. No refund will be made if a child is dismissed from the program due to disrupting program activities.

    In the event of cancellation due to Force majeure, an Act of God, or cancellation by the Rice University campus location, R-STEM will provide a 100% camp credit of monies paid. This credit may be used for any child in the affected camper's immediate family and the credit expires the following program year.

    It is each participant's family’s responsibility to check their email account regularly and to update contact email addresses with the correct contact information. R-STEM is not responsible for notices not received because of such problems.

    **Transfers**  
    We understand that sometimes schedules change and that your child may be unable to attend camp during the session in which he/she is enrolled. We do allow registration transfers to occur but with some caveats. Registration is not transferable to anyone outside your immediate family, and split sessions are unavailable. Decisions related to transfer requests will be based on space availability and will be made at the discretion of R-STEM staff. These transfer requests must be made by sending an email to [stem@rice.edu](mailto:stem@rice.edu?subject=R-STEM%202025%20Summer%20Programs) (phone requests for transfers will not be accepted).Session transfers will only be allowed at least five working days before the start of the session.
