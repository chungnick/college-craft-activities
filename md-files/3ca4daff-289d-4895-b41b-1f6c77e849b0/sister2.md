## Student Voices

#### Incredibly Supportive

"Northwestern has been a part of my life since birth, literally. Although I had many preconceived notions of what life would be like at Feinberg, I fell further in love with this school throughout my interview and [Second Look](how-to-apply/first-look.html) days. This love was not only for the incredibly supportive administration, faculty and senior medical students who made it known that the members of Feinberg are a family but also for the unparalleled research and learning opportunities that are offered from day one."

 - Maya Navarro, Entering Class of 2023

#### Perfect Match

"I chose Feinberg because it was the perfect fit for me. I wanted a school that had an urban setting, valued community engagement and encouraged students to try research at their own pace in their own way. Additionally, as someone who grew up in the Chicagoland area but moved away for college, I was especially excited about being close to family and getting to experience Chicago as a young adult."

 - Paulina Piwowarczyk, Entering Class of 2023

#### Where Students Matter

"From the first interaction, I felt that Feinberg was a place where students matter. Beyond world-class hospitals and educational opportunities, the inclusive and supportive environment at Feinberg is what truly makes it a unique choice."

 - Leandro Bosch, Entering Class of 2022

#### Mentorship

"I specifically chose Feinberg because of the people and the ability to be in clinic from day one. Mentorship has been a huge part of my educational career, and Feinberg excels in making sure each student is surrounded by a well-rounded group of mentors who can guide you to succeed in medical school."

 - Giancarlo Riccobono, Entering Class of 2022

#### Early Clinical Experiences

"I chose Feinberg because of how kind, supportive and inclusive everyone I met at [Second Look](how-to-apply/first-look.html) was, how Feinberg truly supports students' wellness, and the integrated curriculum with early clinical experiences. In terms of wellness, Feinberg does a phenomenal job of designing the curriculum to allow you to explore your interests, and they are so intentional about supporting you to be your best possible self, both professionally and personally."

 - Manushi Shah, Entering Class of 2023
