The Summer Research Internship Program offers an enriching eight-week cardiovascular health research experience, open to students from **South Florida high schools** as well as accepted first-year and transfer students at FIU.

The program consists of **two key time commitments**: curriculum time and research time. The curriculum component takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and features case studies, journal clubs, and workshops. The research component requires a minimum of 15 hours per week, with a flexible schedule to be arranged with a faculty mentor to ensure full participation in the weekly curriculum.

Many of our labs are interdisciplinary, integrating basic science that supports cardiovascular research. **For minors participating in the program**, lab access is thoughtfully structured with limited access and faculty supervision to ensure compliance with safety regulations while providing robust and valuable research experience.

Participants will develop critical thinking skills and better understand experimental design and research methodologies. The program also emphasizes leadership, team building, and communication skills, preparing students for success in their academic and professional careers.

#### **Summer 2026 Program Dates: June 12 - August 7, 2026**

#### **Applications are now open!**

## About the Program

Before their internship, students are matched with an FIU faculty research mentor and must complete at least five online safety courses and all required human resources paperwork. Additionally, all interns must enroll in an internship course as part of their participation. *High school students **accepted into the program** must apply as non-degree-seeking students at FIU to enroll.*

On orientation day, students receive a comprehensive summer research curriculum and calendar of events, lab books, campus maps, food vendor information, intercampus bus schedules, FIU One Card services, and volunteer parking permit forms.

  Continuous program evaluation including student and faculty feedback has played a key role in the success of this program. Follow up with our first interns who have now matriculated into colleges and universities across North America is currently underway! *Preliminary data*so far has revealed that 11 of the 42 college eligible participants are attending FIU. Of those who are freshmen at FIU, 5 are continuing their research with their summer research mentors. Three papers have been published by 2 interns, and 1 patent application was submitted. All students are pursuing degrees in STEM fields. Eighty students have participated in the SRI program since 2010, and continuous follow up is needed to track the outcomes of those currently in college and the junior & senior high school participants who will be entering college in the years ahead.

  Several former SRI participants shared the following comments about their summer research experience:

  + *“The Summer Research Internship was an enlightening experience with valuable exposure to a research facility. **Because I demonstrated interest in performing research by participating in this program, several top twenty schools offered me full tuition scholarships with research stipends**(Emory University, Vanderbilt University), and others offered me research scholarships (Columbia University).”*
  + *“I am currently attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and planning on majoring in biomedical engineering with a pre-med concentration. My long term goals are to get an MD/Ph.D. degree. **Participating in the Summer Research Internship introduced me to a whole new side of science which ultimately fueled my passion for research**. After the internship, I realized that I really enjoyed conducting research and that I would like to continue doing research throughout my career”.*
  + *“**I******think my internship prepared me to be a lot more advanced in terms of my ability to become a lab assistant much sooner than other students****would be able to without any prior experience. I also find myself ahead in my Intro to Linguistics class because of all the linguistics terminology I learned in the PLSD lab [Project on Language and Spatial Development Lab at FIU].”*
  + *“Thanks to this program, I have gotten to really enjoy tinkering with and utilizing computers for a variety of tasks. Whether it be for building a website, making an iOS app, repairing a computer, or even processing a sequence of DNA, I can trace my interests from my time at FIU when I was given responsibility in Dr. [name withheld] lab. Everyone in the lab was helpful and contributed to my development. The three years I spent there were tremendous for me. Not only do **I currently have a part time job with a professional software company, I also have the opportunity to conduct research at UBC for a higher pay grade than I normally could get thanks to the three years and two published papers I partook in.** I sincerely hope this program can continue to be successful.”*
  + “***The Summer Research Internship Program was the most valuable experience that I could have ever had throughout high school.****Having been able to have been a part of such a unique program, I feel more prepared for the trials that are to come throughout the next few years of college, as well as life in the workplace.  I have a younger brother who is just starting high school and I believe that it would benefit him, as well as any other high schooler, to have an appreciation for the lab setting and to be able to partake in what I was able to experience for multiple summers.”*
