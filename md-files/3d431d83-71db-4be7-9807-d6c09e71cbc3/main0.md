# Summer Pre-College at the UMass Mount Ida Campus

Summer 2026 program offerings will be posted in January. In the meantime, check out our Summer 2025 program details below.

Experience the academic quality of the UMass Amherst Pre-College program in the greater Boston area. Our pre-college programs at the Mount Ida Campus invite high school students to experience college-level classes and campus life, including our award-winning UMass dining, all from the convenient location of Newton, MA.

**Residential and Commuter Options**  
Residential pre-college students live in modern dorms on the beautiful, tree-lined campus minutes from the city of Boston. Of course, it takes a little help to adjust to life on a college campus, so we have great live-in program assistants who are specially trained to help you get used to a new environment. We have lots of fun events in the evenings and on weekends that help you connect with other pre-college students.

Local students can take advantage of the commuter option, while still enjoying UMass Amherst's outstanding dining services, as well as free parking, rec center access, and co-curriculars.
