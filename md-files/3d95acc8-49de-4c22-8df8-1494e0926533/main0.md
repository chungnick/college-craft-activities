## About our Partner Organizations:

#### Catholic Charities

Whether they are young or old, hungry or addicted, homeless or friendless, [Catholic Charities](http://www.catholiccharities.net/) sees the face of God in those in need. By providing food, clothing, shelter and counseling, they bring hope to the hopeless in the city of Chicago and its suburbs.

All about help and just about everywhere. Catholic Charities is in your neighborhood. With more than 159 programs at 156 locations across Cook and Lake counties, they help people of all races and religions move toward empowerment and self-sufficiency. Last year Catholic Charities touched the lives of more than 1 million parents, children, seniors and individuals, helping them through hard times.

#### Misericordia

The mission of [Misericordia](http://www.misericordia.com/) is to support individuals with developmental disabilities in maximizing their level of independence and self-determination within an environment that fosters spirituality, dignity, respect and enhancement of quality of life. We promote development of natural family and community support, community awareness, education and advocacy.

Misericordia offers a community of care that maximizes potential for persons with mild to profound developmental disabilities, many of whom are also physically challenged. By serving society’s most vulnerable citizens, Misericordia also serves the families who want the best for them, yet cannot provide it at home.

#### Girlforward

[GirlForward](https://www.girlforward.org/) is a community of support dedicated to creating and enhancing opportunities for girls who have been displaced by conflict and persecution. GirlForward programs focus on mentorship, education, and social support to female-identifying, high school students who have come to the US through refugee resettlement.

#### ONE Northside

[ONE Northside](http://onenorthside.org/) is a mixed-income, multi-ethnic, intergenerational community organizing group on the North Side of Chicago where everyday people lead the fight for a better world and government. We envision a diverse, united North Side of Chicago acting powerfully for our shared values of racial, social, and economic justice in communities where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

#### Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America

Based in Chicago's West Ridge neighborhood, [FORA's](https://www.refugeefora.org/) mission is to ensure that refugee families are provided access to an education sufficient to prepare them to become economically self-sufficient and robustly engaged in American civic life.
