## Genevieve Baynes

**FORA Restorative Justice**

## 

My name is Genevieve Baynes and I am a sophomore at Loyola studying criminal justice, social work and Spanish language on the pre-law track! I am honored and excited to be serving as the Administrative Restorative Justice Intern at FORA (Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America). FORA is a non-profit organization focused on supporting refugee families and children as they navigate their transitional and educational journeys. Through my internship, I will have the privilege of forming connections with students and assisting them in their learning process. I will also complete administrative duties for FORA, which help to streamline the organization’s valuable work. As a pre-law student passionate about advocating for immigrant communities in America, FORA’s mission regarding refugee justice is very close to my heart. I’m looking forward to being a part of the incredible FORA team and providing refugee students access to a community where they feel emotionally uplifted and academically empowered!

## Joie Cabrera

**ONE Northside Community Organizing**

My name is Joie Cabrera (she/her), I’m a Senior studying Psychology with a minor in Asian Studies. I’ve been paired with ONE Northside, an organization whose work focuses on addressing inequalities and building collective power to create a neighborhood in which all can thrive. I’m excited to join their team as a Community Safety Intern. In this role, I look towards promoting community safety and police accountability and working with the Violence Prevention team, a group dedicated to making a direct impact on those affected by gun violence. Alongside these roles, I look forward to working with ONE Northside to ensure that public safety policies protect everyone. We cannot expect a community to thrive if its members feel unsafe and/or experience structural injustice. To move towards a safer Chicago for all, we must address systemic violence that unjustly targets marginalized communities and directly work with residents by addressing key issues they have about safety and police violence.

## Liz-Anne De Beauville-Jones

**GirlForward Programs**

My name is Liz-Anne De Beauville-Jones, and I am a senior at Loyola University Chicago. As a philosophy major and law and politics minor, my goals are to serve others, shed light on pertinent topics, and advocate for those still on their journey of discovering their voice. During my social justice internship, I will be a Program’s Intern at Girl Forward. This organization provides essential tools for female refugees who have been displaced due to various forms of conflict in their countries. As a program's intern, I’m lending my knowledge and creativity to support their core programs, which include mentoring, tutoring, and creating safe spaces. I am also eager to learn about how organizations like this navigate the various policies that affect their operations, as well as lead change for the community. Not only am I excited about this venture and taking on personal projects, but I am exceedingly honored to work with the brave souls who found a safe haven in Girl Forward, and I anticipate learning from them as well.

## Amara Grajewski

**FORA Restorative Justice**

My name is Amara Grajewski. I am a current senior at Loyola with an academic focus in Global Studies and Religious Studies. I am lucky to be working with Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America (FOR A). Although I have been tutoring at FORA for a year, I am excited to be stepping into a new role as a Programmatic Restorative Justice Intern. As an intern, I have the opportunity to bring my teaching experience into the administrative side of an education-based nonprofit. I believe that building my experience on both of these ends will allow me to better assist the children who I work with, who face a unique set of obstacles. I believe that every child should be made aware of their intelligence and the unique gifts they have to offer the world. A great way to nurture this self-assurance is through skills such as literacy and education. As an organization, FORA recognizes that education is a form of empowerment, and I take great pride in working with them to forward this mission with the children in their program.

## Mariah Huley

**GirlForward Mentorship**

My name is Mariah Huley, and I’m a senior at Loyola University Chicago majoring in Healthcare Administration on the Pre-Law track. Through Loyola’s Social Justice Internship Program, I’m proud to serve as a Mentoring Intern with GirlForward—a community dedicated to creating and enhancing opportunities for girls who have been displaced globally by conflict and persecution. My passion lies in ensuring that every girl—regardless of her circumstances—has access to the resources, confidence, and support she needs to thrive. I’m committed to advocating for underrepresented communities, expanding educational opportunities, and helping build inclusive spaces where girls can grow into bold, empowered leaders. Contributing to GirlForward’s mission inspires me daily, and I’m excited to continue supporting the next generation of changemakers.

## Ashley Jimmerson

**GirlForward Communications**

My name is Ashley Jimmerson, and I am a senior at Loyola University Chicago majoring in Psychology with minors in Psychology of Crime & Justice and Women's & Gender Studies. I am proud to serve as the Communications Intern for GirlForward, a nonprofit that provides refugee and immigrant girls aged 12 to 21 with mentorship, educational support, and spaces to grow socially, emotionally, and academically. The organization's commitment to centering the voices of young women impacted by displacement deeply resonates with my own values. In my role, I will help share GirlForward's mission and impact through social media content, storytelling, and creative outreach. I am especially excited to highlight the experiences and perspectives of the girls in the program, build digital engagement, and promote GirlForward's work to a wider audience. I look forward to gaining hands-on experience in nonprofit communications and advocacy while supporting GirlForward's vision of building inclusive, affirming spaces for refugee youth in Chicago.

## Naina Kapur

**Misericordia Personal Effectiveness Program**

Hi! My name is Naina and I am a second-year student at Loyola. I am a Psychology major with minors in Law and Politics and Spanish, and I am also a part of the Interdisciplinary Honors College. I am so thrilled to be joining the team at Misericordia as their Personal Effectiveness Program Intern. At Misericordia, I have the opportunity to help improve the lives of people with physical and intellectual disabilities using new technology. Our goal is to help improve quality of life and overall engagement. This internship is particularly special to me because not only am I deeply interested in the intersection of law, psychology, and ethics, but I also live with a physical disability. So, my goal with this internship is to further explore how others with disabilities are affected by the world around them. I am so excited to see what this experience holds for me and the team that I will get to work with!

## Avery Kendrick

**GirlForward Education**

My name is Avery Kendrick and I am in my third year at Loyola studying Social Work with a minor in Women’s and Gender Studies. I serve as the Education Intern at GirlForward, an organization that fosters a community of support for adolescents and young adults who are refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers. Their tutoring program pairs up students with local volunteers who work to help them strengthen their English proficiency, complete homework, and build confidence in their skills. This organization provides a safe, welcoming environment for girls to recharge after school and enhance their learning in order to grow in the classroom and the world. I have experience as a GirlForward tutor myself, so I am eager to return with this opportunity as I have seen the profound impact that this program makes on the students and tutors alike. In this position, I am responsible for coordinating online and in-person sessions and developing program initiatives.  As I learn how to best support intersectional marginalized communities in the current social climate, there is no greater chance to act on these values and work alongside my own generation of women to teach one another. Immersing students in an equitable educational environment allows them to emerge into adulthood with the self-assurance they need to thrive.

## Joie Cabrera

**ONE Northside Community Organizing**

My name is Joie Cabrera (she/her), I’m a Senior studying Psychology with a minor in Asian Studies. I’ve been paired with ONE Northside, an organization whose work focuses on addressing inequalities and building collective power to create a neighborhood in which all can thrive. I’m excited to join their team as a Community Safety Intern. In this role, I look towards promoting community safety and police accountability and working with the Violence Prevention team, a group dedicated to making a direct impact on those affected by gun violence. Alongside these roles, I look forward to working with ONE Northside to ensure that public safety policies protect everyone. We cannot expect a community to thrive if its members feel unsafe and/or experience structural injustice. To move towards a safer Chicago for all, we must address systemic violence that unjustly targets marginalized communities and directly work with residents by addressing key issues they have about safety and police violence.

## Amara Grajewski

**FORA Restorative Justice**

My name is Amara Grajewski. I am a current senior at Loyola with an academic focus in Global Studies and Religious Studies. I am lucky to be working with Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America (FOR A). Although I have been tutoring at FORA for a year, I am excited to be stepping into a new role as a Programmatic Restorative Justice Intern. As an intern, I have the opportunity to bring my teaching experience into the administrative side of an education-based nonprofit. I believe that building my experience on both of these ends will allow me to better assist the children who I work with, who face a unique set of obstacles. I believe that every child should be made aware of their intelligence and the unique gifts they have to offer the world. A great way to nurture this self-assurance is through skills such as literacy and education. As an organization, FORA recognizes that education is a form of empowerment, and I take great pride in working with them to forward this mission with the children in their program.
