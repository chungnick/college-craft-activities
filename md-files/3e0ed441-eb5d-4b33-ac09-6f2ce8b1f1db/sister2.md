|  | **A note from Professor Scassellati:**  *I encourage you to apply for admission to the graduate program in Computer Science at Yale. We are always looking for good students with a strong undergraduate preparation. All applicants who show interest in robotics eventually end up on my desk, so I will be certain to see your admissions package. Unfortunately, I cannot estimate your chances of being admitted. Please do not email me your CV, letters of reference, or other application materials. I cannot consider them unless they come through the official channels and sending them directly to me will not help you get admitted.* |

Information on Graduate Admissions can be found at the **[Yale Graduate School of Arts & Sciences- Office of Graduate Admissions](http://www.yale.edu/graduateschool/admissions/)**.
