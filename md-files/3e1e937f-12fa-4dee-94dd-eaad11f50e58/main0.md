## What You Need to Know

Course StructureCosts & DiscountsApplication ComponentsEligibility

Course Structure
Click to Open

In 2026, Babson Summer Study will be offered in two learning formats: fully online or in person. In both formats, students are enrolled in the Babson College course, *EPS 1110 Introduction to the Entrepreneurial Experience*. The course takes place from 8-11 a.m. Eastern Time. In addition to the three hours a day in class, students in all learning formats will spend an additional five hours a day (a total of 40 hours a week) working on out-of-class assignments, both individually and with their team. 

#### Fully online format

As in years past, students are able to take the full course online. The first hour is in a large virtual classroom, bringing together students from all course sections, followed by two hours where sections split into their professor’s Zoom classroom. Online students are able to meet with their peers afterward to complete group work online.

#### In-person format: Hosted by New England Innovation Academy (NEIA)

The in-person format is hosted by [New England Innovation Academy](https://neiacademy.org/) (NEIA) in Marlborough, Massachusetts, NOT at the Babson College campus in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

Students will attend class at NEIA with a Babson professor for the full, three-hour morning session each day, the first hour of which will incorporate Zoom to allow in-person and virtual students to attend the session together. Students will participate in the NEIA Kreate Summer AI Program in the afternoon to complement the Babson College course curriculum.

Choose between two in-person options:

* **Residential Student:** Students live on NEIA’s campus
* **Day Student:** Students will participate in the NEIA Kreate Summer AI Program in the afternoon to complement the Babson College course curriculum, but do not live on NEIA’s campus; they arrange their own daily transportation and housing.
