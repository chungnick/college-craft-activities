### **UC Riverside STRIDE program for high school students aims to diversify STEM workforce.**

The Summer Training and Research Inspiration for Diverse Pipeline Engagement toward Advancing Stem Cell Treatment, or STRIDE, will be a 5-week summer research training program for 60 high school students from throughout Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which comprise the Inland Empire. The Inland Empire is a medically underserved region. STRIDE aims to increase and diversify the STEM workforce to address unmet medical needs. All high school students in Inland Empire (> 16 years old by the program start date) are welcome to apply.

STRIDE Trainees will participate in carefully designed summer research and educational activities. STRIDE will provide important experiences for students of different levels, including high school trainees but also student mentors selected from a diverse pool of undergraduate students, graduate students, and medical students, or postdoctoral scholars at UCR. The STRIDE program closely collaborates with [Stem Cell Center](https://stemcell.ucr.edu/), CIRM BRIDGE program at Cal State San Bernardino, and UCR TRANSCEND graduate and postdoctoral training program, which forms a training pathway from high school students to postdoctoral professionals.

Faculty mentors from UCR’s Bourns College of Engineering, College of Agricultural & Natural Sciences, and School of Medicine will invite 12 trainees to work on research projects in their labs each summer. STRIDE will also provide important training on communication skills and research skills for trainees, through a set of core workshops, invited speakers, discussion, career panels, and mentoring sessions. Trainees will learn science and engineering skills by participating in laboratory research projects related to stem cells and regenerative medicine in the areas of bioengineering, materials science, tissue engineering, neuroscience and neural engineering, stem cell biology, aging related diseases, toxicology, and other related fields.

An experienced group of outreach program directors and faculty mentors from BCOE, CNAS, SOM, Graduate Division, Student Affairs, and Provost’s office serve on the advisory board of STRIDE to ensure the program success. The program will collaborate closely with current programs at UCR to recruit diverse students and help them succeed, including [UCR Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievement](https://mesa.engr.ucr.edu/) programs; [UCR Early Academic Outreach Programs](https://eaop.ucr.edu/); [TRIO pre-college programs](https://trioprecollege.ucr.edu/); and [UCR School of Medicine Pathway Programs](https://pathwayprograms.ucr.edu/).

Southern California permanent residents in Inland Empire school districts with referrals from a STEM teacher and/or from these current UCR outreach programs are encouraged to apply. The STRIDE program will start recruitment in the Fall for the 5-week summer program from **June 22 to July 24, 2026**. More details about program recruitment and curriculum will be updated at the STRIDE website ([stride.engr.ucr.edu](https://stride.engr.ucr.edu/)).

The STRIDE program is funded by a $509,000 5-year grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, the state’s stem cell agency.
