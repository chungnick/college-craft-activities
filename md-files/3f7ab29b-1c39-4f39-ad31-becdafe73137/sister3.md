# Education and Training

## Training the Next Generation of Scientists

CIRM’s Education and Training programs are a vital link to tomorrow.

The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) offers invaluable educational and training pathways in regenerative medicine tailored for students and young professionals representing the diversity of California.

Four CIRM-funded internship and training programs—**SPARK, Bridges, COMPASS, and Scholars**—support the next generation of regenerative medicine scientists, ranging from high school and undergrad students to doctoral candidates and clinical fellows. Each program offers hands-on experience for students to build the technical skills that are crucial for present and future scientific and medical advancements.

## Growing the Regenerative Medicine Workforce

CIRM believes in providing opportunities in regenerative medicine accessible to individuals across various educational backgrounds and skill levels to foster a diverse workforce adept in stem cell science.

Regenerative therapies are transforming the field of medicine as we know it. With the largest biotechnology employment base in the nation, California biotech companies are actively seeking new talent to research, develop, and manufacture stem cell therapies. To bring the full potential of regenerative medical breakthroughs to market and to the world, California needs a large, diverse, and skilled scientific workforce.

## SPARK

The Summer Program to Accelerate Regenerative Medicine Knowledge (SPARK) offers California high school students an invaluable opportunity to gain hands-on training in stem cell research at some of the leading research institutes in California.
