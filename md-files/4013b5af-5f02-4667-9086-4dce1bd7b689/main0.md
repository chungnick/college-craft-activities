# High School Summer Internship Program

2025 High School Summer Internship Program Cohort Group Photo

The USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future (CPF), in partnership with the USC Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability, offers select high school students a prestigious summer internship program that is held entirely online. The most current cohort of students appears below. [**CLICK HERE to see past cohorts of the High School Summer Internship Program**](https://dornsife.usc.edu/center-for-political-future/past-cohorts-high-school-summer-internship-program/ "https://dornsife.usc.edu/center-for-political-future/past-cohorts-high-school-summer-internship-program/").

Students enrolled in our summer internship will be required to complete two major projects (legislative policy memo and legislative process analysis) in relation to the bill of their choosing on the local, state, or federal level that focuses on environmental policy or sustainability. The bill could be a bill that has been passed, is currently in the legislative process, or died during the legislative process.

Students are required to:

* Provide explicit parental permission to participate (permission field is in the application itself)
* Email a high-resolution photo headshot
* Email a testimonial about their experience (150 words max)
* Attend ALL five check in sessions ([See syllabus for dates and times](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pXYMt7q6aFuTvj1c-J4p492g5zJVyvSI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105996325980728210002&rtpof=true&sd=true))
* Submit two written assignments within the deadlines
* Edit the same two assignments per feedback from Program Administrator by final deadline

Missing **any** of the six required elements above will result in student dismissal from the program. Students who do complete all the required elements will have one of their two assignments published online, and receive public recognition as an official “Summer Research Intern for the USC Center for the Political Future and the USC Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability.”

The application for the Summer 2025 USC CPF/Wrigley High School Internship Program is closed. The application will reopen in May 2026.

We normally have far more applicants than spots available.

**Eligibility Requirements:**

* Must be a high school student. Graduating seniors do not qualify.
* Minimum GPA 3.5
* Must be available June 1-August 1

More detailed information about the internship can be found on the **[2025 High School Intern Program Syllabus.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pXYMt7q6aFuTvj1c-J4p492g5zJVyvSI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112198880665576069248&rtpof=true&sd=true)**

### 2025 High School Summer Internship Program Cohort

2025 High School Summer Internship Program Cohort: Claire An, Kristy Chan, Jethro Bumanglag, Anjana Boppana, Alex Karanjai, Hailey Khetiya, Maximus Lee, Maya Nawachi, Cason Noll, Sharmada Palakurthi, Andrea Ramirez, Gavin Tesser, Ishani Tamma, and Afia Mubashir (top-left to bottom-right)

The 2025 High School Summer Internship Program cohort shared their experiences below. Read each student’s legislative policy memo by clicking on the student’s name.

* **[Claire An](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5A2pHWALQPtXK431oT69ymPP36qte5p7Y76ei5b-xw/edit?usp=sharing) (Canyon Crest Academy):** “My CPF internship experience was exciting and grounding; it opened my perspective toward greater political science opportunities. I gained insights into creating policy memos and policy analyses, which are important skills for working and forwarding policy from the local to the national level. Additionally, speaking with experts in the environmental policy field allowed me to explore opportunities and encouraged me to enter this profession. I am extremely grateful for the enriching opportunity that I gained this summer!”

* **[Anjana Boppana](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SoM6vhoZiQyi7U4lHQzartNRNC38hBIBGaUnvl1hJMw/edit?usp=sharing)** **(Coppell High School)****:** “This experience was highly informative and eye-opening, deepening my understanding of current environmental legislation. I conducted in-depth research on sustainability policies and had the incredible opportunity to present my findings to Congressman Marc Veasey (D-TX), who added my work as an official resource for his office. The discussions we’ve had throughout the program are more relevant than ever, with climate change and public health at the forefront of national concern. I’ve gained a stronger appreciation for the policymaking process and the role youth voices can play in shaping a more sustainable future.”

* **[Jethro Bumanglag](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Apu7DgyB-x7xTvsrXNsRcJjYJgbxtT3KNOiNDx0b3FI/edit?usp=sharing) (Damien Memorial School):** “In Hawai’i, we grow up hearing ‘Mālama ‘Āina’ from our kūpuna (elders). ‘Mālama ‘Āina’ expresses the responsibility to care for the land and manage its natural resources properly. This was my guiding principle entering into this research internship at the USC Center for the Political Future. I was introduced to the intricate world of policymaking and how to conduct the necessary research to inform environmental legislation and advocate for my community’s needs. Authoring both policy papers honed my writing and research skills, especially under the mentorship of the CPF staff, for which I’m incredibly grateful. I’m also grateful for the insights provided by Professor Becker and the guest speakers. This experience has encouraged me to pursue other policy-oriented opportunities.”

* **[Kristy Chan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WY5UIgn4k_TFonIGMyDJzBkmRnvFq9rP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108263971192627687741&rtpof=true&sd=true) (ESF Sha Tin College):** “The CPF internship experience was a memorable and insightful journey into environmental policy. I valued the level of independence and academic rigor of this program, especially as I learned firsthand how to conduct research and analyze the topic until I had no further questions to ask myself. I greatly appreciated the CPF staff, guest speakers, and fellow interns, all of whom brought so much passion, energy, and knowledge to the many in-depth discussions we had. I’ll forever be grateful to this program for encouraging me to think critically beyond the surface level and reflect on the intersection of political dynamics and climate solutions.”

* **[Alex Karanjai](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KpODjIpmdzAbRNe8A8r9-dSfz8bmf8ig/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108263971192627687741&rtpof=true&sd=true) (Pine View School):** “My CPF experience catalyzed my ambition to turn ideas into meaningful change. From building out a policy memo to writing a legislative process analysis, CPF guided me to focus my arguments on strategic and sustainable impact. Throughout the program, the valuable mentorship and community of like-driven peers encouraged me to pursue my own sense of purpose while shifting my mindset beyond identifying problems to understanding my role in solving them.”

* **[Hailey Khetiya](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VR-nothXrjSCjwIci741uyWsncityUgNJOFLt_ZV_wY/edit?usp=sharing) (Woodbridge High School):** “Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to learn from different professionals working in the field of environmental science. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to apply what I learned throughout the program to complete two assignments on a topic of my choice. I enjoyed the program and learned about public policy, environmental science, and activism.”

* **[Maximus Lee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2EyEtVtaddYCk-_IGm5CWlVwachMfvP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108263971192627687741&rtpof=true&sd=true)** **(Harvard Westlake School)****:** “I gained valuable experience in policy writing and analysis. I learned how to craft well-researched policy memos tailored to various stakeholders, and I developed a deeper understanding of the policymaking process. I enjoyed working on real issues that affect communities and contributing meaningful solutions in a professional document. This internship is amazing if you are looking to dive into policy and learn from people who know policy. CPF deepened my interest in public policy and inspired me to continue engaging with it in my academic and professional journey.”

* **[Afia Mubashir](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUT4N2jzMxeU23COwLjxIceGseAbVssvszJlnFoKHno/edit?usp=sharing)** **(West Windsor Plainsboro High School South)****:** “The CPF internship was an extremely valuable experience! The internship taught me skills such as political analysis and argumentative writing, and pushed me to engage more critically with laws affecting local governance. The speaker sessions remained the most insightful part of the internship, offering insights into real-life policymaking, lobbying and stakeholder engagement. I am grateful to have gotten the opportunity to participate in this program and engage with like-minded peers!”

* **[Maya Nawachi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J17KeHJy7Z03Qwp42sRgj4wSyhYHvMMTaViub6Oxeo0/edit?usp=sharing) (West High School):** “This internship opportunity allowed me to expand my current knowledge on climate change and helped me have a more comprehensive understanding of environmental policy. It was an incredibly enriching opportunity where I got to strengthen my research and analysis skills, and pushed me to think more critically about pressing issues that we face today. Being able to engage with people in the environmental policy field allowed me to gain insight into their careers and expertise on climate-related challenges.”

* **[Cason Noll](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HYLqCQDwZ2evja1pWCkuB72JQeiMPdvoIJ_lnQAkgn8/edit?usp=sharing) (Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas):** “My experience as a CPF intern can best be described as opening a new door into policy that would have otherwise stayed closed. In what started out as a seed of curiosity, my knowledge quickly grew into a deeper understanding of where politics, policy, and the environment intersect. With guidance from CPF staff and various guest speakers, I developed research on legislation of my choice, highlighting the political dynamics and critically thinking about potential solutions. The program’s insightful discussions, career advice, and bipartisan emphasis fundamentally changed the way I enjoy policy. I’m tremendously thankful for such a remarkable opportunity, and I can’t wait to apply my knowledge to the future of policy and beyond.”

Ray High School):** “The CPF internship was a very valuable educational experience! Through legislative memo and legislative analysis assignments, I was able to greatly improve my writing and communication skills. The program taught me how to challenge my personal beliefs by assessing multiple perspectives and stakeholder views on certain issues. The staff provided very helpful constructive feedback and helped foster a supportive community that I was really grateful to be a part of.”

I gained insight into the legislative process and deepened my interest in environmental policy. More importantly, I learned to communicate, persevere, and represent myself. This internship prepared me for the next phase of my life, one where I need to do more than is comfortable to grow as a person and get what I want. I’ve appreciated these lessons, but especially the people who have taught them to us. Their genuine desire to help us improve as students and people has strengthened my confidence not only as a writer, but also in my ability to make choices that will support my growth and advancement.”

The program’s structure emphasizes a comprehensive feedback system, incredible insights from keynote speakers, and career guidance from CPF staff. Projects challenge interns to analyze controversial policy issues from multiple angles, thereby fostering both critical thinking and empathy. I’ve undoubtedly come away from this opportunity with improved writing, research, and data interpretation skills—and most importantly, a thorough understanding of real-world policy work. I’m grateful to CPF for making this high-impact opportunity accessible to eager students.”

Through in-depth research, I learned more about local, state, and federal legislation. By drafting a policy memo and legislative analysis, I gained a new perspective on how policy is influenced by the political atmosphere and science. My most valuable takeaway was having the opportunity to send my papers to my California state representatives. I’m now working with their offices to implement my bill amendments. This experience taught me that student advocacy and research can impact policies and solidified my interest in pursuing environmental studies in college.”
