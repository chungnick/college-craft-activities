**Program:**Forensic Science is defined as the application of science to matters of or pertaining
to the law. This program includes a variety of scientific disciplines including Biology, Chemistry, Physics,
Biochemistry, Earth Science, and other applied sciences. It will explore the various
disciplines that fall under the umbrella of Forensic Science. It will complement the
students' science curriculum in high school and challenge them to think, investigate,
and solve problems. This workshop can serve to help students to decide if they are
interested in taking forensics in high school. The focus of the five days concentrates
upon the development of skills and techniques that will be utilized to process a mock
crime scene(s) as the culmination of a week full of hard work, learning, and fun.

**Participant & Application Requirements:**Students should be interested in science, inquisitive, and looking to have fun while
seeing first-hand how many of the principles they learn in their science classes everyday
are used to help solve crimes and uphold the law. Students should submit a complete
application (application form, 2 letters of recommendation, essays, trancript and
most recent report card)  by **May 1, 2026**.  Participants are selected based on a solid academic record, strong letters of recommendation
and essays. We will accept a maximum of 24 students. No money is due at the time of
application.

**Activities:**The program will start with an introduction to forensics science and lead to a mock
crime scene investigation. The investigations throughout the 5 days will be interactive,
hands on and will be building on prior knowledge. We will also see how forensic science
was used to solve noteworthy criminal cases in history.

Other goals and objectives students will be familiar with by the end of the program
include:

* Branches of Forensics
* Lie Detecting
* Memory Exercises
* Anthropology
* Logic Problem Solving
* Crime Scene Processing
* Fingerprinting
* Lip Printing
* Odontology
* Shoe printing
* Handwriting Analysis
* Hair and Fiber Analysis
* Chromatography
* Blood Typing
* Blood Splatter
* Toxicology
* DNA fingerprinting
