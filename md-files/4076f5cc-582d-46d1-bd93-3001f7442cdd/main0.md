## **Toxicology Camp**

**OSU Campus \*****Entering Grades 9-12 \*****July 7-9 \* 1:30-4:30PM****\* $140 \* Needs-based scholarships available**

What is toxicology? It is the study of how chemicals and substances affect people, animals, and the earth! In this camp, students will explore what it means for a chemical or substance to be "toxic" or "safe." We'll also learn about ways to protect humans and the environment from toxins. Our student scientists will get to conduct their own toxicology experiments and analyze their data. Activities will reflect real-world challenges that scientists in toxicology and environmental chemistry face. We will go into “the field” to sample the environment, test chemical effects in daphnia, and explore molecular mechanisms in glowing zebrafish.

## Color Innovation Workshop

**OSU Campus \* Entering Grades 9-12 \* July 10 \* 1:30-4:30 \* $80 \* Needs-based scholarships available**

Do you want to learn about color trends and forecasting, color symbolism, and color schemes in the design sphere? People make decisions about purchasing products primarily based on product color. In this hands-on workshop, students will learn and apply design concepts and color strategies that designers and marketers use to develop and promote products that consumers love. Students will brainstorm color schemes and apply color theory to develop Mood Boards that focus on color and branding.

Love solving puzzles? Enjoy cracking mysteries with friends? Then this camp is for you! Cybersecurity might sound technical, but at its core, it’s about protecting people and solving problems. In this camp, you’ll tackle hands-on challenges in a fun, supportive environment and meet cybersecurity professionals and college students. Learn how hackers try to break into computer networks, uncover clues through digital forensics, spot sneaky phishing scams, and discover how encryption—secret codes—keeps information safe. Every challenge is like a puzzle waiting to be solved, and you’ll use logic and teamwork to uncover the answers. Cybersecurity is an increasingly important field as technology continues to play a major role in our lives. From protecting personal and sensitive information to securing critical infrastructure, cybersecurity is a crucial part of modern society. It’s also one of today’s fastest-growing fields, with huge demand for problem-solvers like you—and great pay (average salaries around $135,000!). Every industry needs cybersecurity experts, so this camp is your opportunity to explore a career you can take in many directions. No computer science experience needed—just bring your curiosity and problem-solving skills!
