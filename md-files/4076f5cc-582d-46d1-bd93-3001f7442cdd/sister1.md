## Supporting Students Since 1969

For more than 150 years, OSU has advanced its mission as a land grant university by broadening pathways to higher education. The Educational Opportunities Program supports students on all steps of their academic pathway. Pre-college outreach enriches the experience of K-12 students and offers adults a route to a high school equivalency degree. For students enrolled at OSU, EOP empowers students with the tools and support to attain their educational goals and graduate. Programs offer guidance on transitioning to higher education, academic counseling, tutoring and specialized classes in a community-focused and supportive environment.

### History of the Educational Opportunities Program

In 1969, the recently formed Black Student Union organized class boycotts and a sit-in in response to racial clashes between the OSU football coach and Black student athletes including Fred Milton. Tensions culminated in a walkout and march across campus on March 5, 1969. As a result, the BSU successfully advocated for change and better support for students of color which led to the establishment of the Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) in 1969 and later led to the seven cultural resource centers serving students across Oregon State. EOP began with 48 students in 1969. Today we serve over 400 students.
