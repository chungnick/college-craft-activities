# Challenge *Convention*

## Experience Rice University Before College

Rice is a community of curious thinkers, passionate dreamers and energetic doers who believe that improving the world demands more than bold thought and brave action. It takes unconventional wisdom. Our goal in creating Rice University's Precollege Program is to provide an experience for students ages 13+ that embodies these values. Our program is designed for high school students who wish to dive deeper into subjects that piques their interest, such as genome engineering, physiology, aerospace, law, and more. Each course features dynamic video lessons by renowned Rice faculty and access to mentors. Courses are available year-round, and the online format enables students to study anywhere, anytime, at their own pace. This flexibility allows students to take multiple courses and explore a variety of subjects. Upon successfully completing a course's capstone project, participants will earn a Certificate of Completion from Rice University.

## Hear From Our Students

*"It was very well organized which made every lesson easy to follow along with. There were interactive and visuals as well as assignments that helped you visualize and apply the knowledge that you learned. It was very helpful and simple to learn with this structure. Having a mentor to ask questions to at the same time was very helpful too."* - Chandani, Rice University Precollege student from TX.

*"I really enjoyed how I was able to learn the material of the course from my own house, and how  I was able to do it at the time that was convenient for me. Also the course material was extremely interesting and I learned a lot, so since I enjoyed the course so much I would recommend it to my others."* - Amir, Rice University Precollege student from FL.

*"There are no in person classes or online meetings, so I was able to take this course while going on vacation for the whole summer. For someone who easily gets anxiety over zoom meetings and meeting strangers, I was able to learn about what I was interested in without any stress."* - Elena, Rice University Precollege student from CA.
