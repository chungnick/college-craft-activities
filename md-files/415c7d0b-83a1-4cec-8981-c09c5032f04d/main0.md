# Summer Scholars Program

[The Summer Scholars 2026 application is open](https://tufts.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bpClDraYJM7LGnk)! All application materials are due by **February 13, 2026.**

We will be holding info sessions in January, but in the meantime, you can check out [a recording of an info session from Jan 22, 2024 here](https://tufts.box.com/s/ykep3ldwwvoyyivb5y56n6gpklrn6zf0). 

Interested in seeing posters from previous Summer Scholars? [Check it out](https://tufts.box.com/s/kpk4ayap2i4skw5xlshqoozwwovs7tnr).

## About the Program

What’s your obsession? Particle physics? History of dance? Early American political poetry? Crepidula Fornicata? Kant? Spend this summer working closely with a faculty mentor and a cohort of like-minded nerds from across the disciplines in Tufts’ Summer Scholars program.

The Summer Scholars program funds rising juniors and seniors to pursue ten-week independent research projects with the guidance of a faculty mentor. As part of the program, you will present your research three times. This first will be at a conference at the end of the summer. Then, you will create a poster to present at a poster session in the fall. Summer Scholars then present the next stage of your research at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://students.tufts.edu/academic-advising-and-undergraduate-studies/tufts-research-symposium "https://students.tufts.edu/academic-advising-and-undergraduate-studies/tufts-research-symposium") in the spring. Often, this summer project will culminate in your [senior honors thesis](https://students.tufts.edu/academic-advising-and-undergraduate-studies/senior-honors-thesis "https://students.tufts.edu/academic-advising-and-undergraduate-studies/senior-honors-thesis").

The program is open to Tufts undergraduates currently in their second or third year of study with a minimum GPA of 3.0. Each student can only apply with one faculty mentor, and each faculty mentor is limited to apply with one student. Faculty mentors must be Tufts faculty, and can come from any of the Schools.

Applicants in the fine arts should upload 5-10 images or recordings to a Box folder as well as a document briefly describing each piece, and add [emily.palermo@tufts.edu](mailto:emily.palermo@tufts.edu) as a collaborator. (.pdf) or (.jpg) format is preferred.

To download the Programs Requirements, see [Program Requirements](https://tufts.box.com/v/sl-program-requirements).

Applications are due February 13th, 2026, at 5 p.m. EST. If you have any questions, please contact [scholardevelopment@tufts.edu](mailto:scholardevelopment@tufts.edu).

### Application Materials

* A series of short-answer questions
* A 1-2 page CV or resume
* A copy of your transcript(s)
* A brief abstract, in accessible language, free from jargon or acronyms
* A 750-word project proposal that you author yourself
* A brief description of how your research will change if conducted remotely
* A letter of collaboration, co-authored with your faculty mentor
* A signed copy of the Program Requirements
* Fine arts applicants should upload 5-10 images or recordings to a Box folder as well as a document briefly describing each piece and add [scholardevelopment@tufts.edu](mailto:scholardevelopment@tufts.edu) as a collaborator. PDF or JPG format preferred.
* Two letters of recommendation, sent directly to [scholardevelopment@tufts.edu](mailto:scholardevelopment@tufts.edu). Neither letter can come from your faculty mentor or someone associated with your lab, and at least one letter needs to come from a Tufts faculty member.

## Expectations and Award

### The Award

* $4000 for living expenses
* $1000 research budget for the student, available to you until you graduate
* $1000 research award for the faculty mentor, deposited directly into their research account
* Housing  scholarships are available to students who receive financial aid from Tufts.
* Note: for international students, stipends are taxed upfront up to 30% depending on your country of origin. You can recoup this money by [filing a 1042-S form](https://access.tufts.edu/irs-form-1042-s-foreign-persons-us-source-income-subject-withholding) when you file your taxes.

### Expectations

The Summer Scholars program is a full-time commitment. As such, students may not simultaneously pursue full-time employment. Students may work 5-10 hours per week if approved by the Program Manager. Additionally, students may not take summer classes or participate in internships while participating in the program. Students need to commit to the program full-time for at least ten weeks.

Each faculty member can only apply with *one* student.

Students are expected to present their work three times:

* At a two-day conference at the end of the second summer session
* At a poster session in the fall
* At the [Undergraduate Research and Scholarship Symposium](/academic-advising-and-undergraduate-studies/tufts-research-symposium "Tufts Research Symposium") the following spring

Students can conduct research abroad, but must secure an affiliation in their host country to do so. For more information, see our [official policy on student travel](https://tufts.box.com/v/sl-summer-scholars-travel).

While the dates of the ten-week program are flexible, we do ask that those students who are not conducting their research abroad be **on campus** for the end-of-year conference, which is held during the final week of Summer Session II.
