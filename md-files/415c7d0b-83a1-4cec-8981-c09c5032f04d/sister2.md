# IRS Form 1042-S: Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding

*Audience: Nonresident (tax) Employees, Students & Scholars*

### **What is a 1042-S?**

A non-citizen is, in most cases, subject to U.S. tax on income from U.S. sources. Form 1042-S, Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, is used to report amounts paid to foreign persons (including those presumed to be foreign) by a United States based institution or business. This applies to non-resident individuals, foreign partnerships, foreign corporations, foreign estates, and foreign trusts that are subject to income tax withholding.

### **How do I get a copy of my 1042-S?**

Your 1042-S is available through Sprintax Calculus. If you received a 1042-S, you will be notified in early March via email with login instructions.

### I don't know if I'm getting a 1042-S. What are the conditions for being issued a 1042-S?

A 1042-S will be issued to international students, employees, and vendors who received one or more of the following types of payment:

* Employment wages exempt from tax withholding due to a tax treaty
* Non-qualified taxable scholarship or fellowship (Taxable scholarships are those received by a non-degree candidate or for incidental expenses, such as room and board, travel, and other expenses that are not required for enrollment)

### **What do I need to do if I receive a 1042-S?**

* Any Foreign National who received a W-2 and/or a 1042-S is required to file a Federal and State tax return (regardless of any Tax Treaties).  Nonresident (tax) employees may receive a 1042-S instead of/in addition to a W-2.
* The International Center provides access to a tax preparation software called *Sprintax* to assist you in your tax filings. (<https://icenter.tufts.edu/practical-matters/us-income-taxes/tax-filing>/)

### Why did I get a second 1042-S?

Two separate 1042-S may be issued, for example, if you received both employment wages under a tax treaty and a non-qualified taxable scholarship. If you do receive multiple 1042-S, you must file both, as they contain different earning types and taxation rates.

### **How do I get my 1042-S from Sprintax Calculus into Sprintax Returns?**

Sprintax Calculus and Sprintax Returns are separate programs with separate logins - however if you use the same email credentials to access both systems, you will be able to automatically pull your 1042-S directly from Sprintax Calculus into Sprintax Returns.

If you have created an account with Sprintax Returns using a different email address, you may download your 1042-S from Sprintax Calculus and upload it into Sprintax Returns when completing your tax filing. Alternatively, you may email [TSS@tufts.edu](mailto:TSS@tufts.edu) to request an update to the email address in Sprintax Calculus. (Email address must be on file in SIS or eServe for updates to be processed)
