# Tufts Research Symposium

## The Symposium

Please join us at the 2025 Undergraduate Research and Scholarship Symposium!

The Tufts Undergraduate Research and Scholarship Symposium is held once each academic year to celebrate the scholarship and research of Tufts undergraduate students. It includes presentations by undergraduates from all disciplines: natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, humanities, and the arts.

Mark your calendars now for the 2024-2025 symposium, which will be held in person in 574 Boston Ave on May 1st, 2025, from 12:00pm to 6:00pm!

Any Tufts undergraduate can submit an abstract for **an 8-minute oral presentation** or **a conference poster.**

Abstracts will be accepted from March 1st to April 4th. **You can find the submission link below.** 

The symposium provides a great forum to meet other undergraduate researchers and exchange interdisciplinary ideas. Additionally, it is an opportunity to present research before Tufts faculty members and student peers. Thesis writers take note--the symposium is a great way to fine-tune your presentation skills.

Please email [emily.palermo@tufts.edu](mailto:emily.palermo@tufts.edu "mailto:emily.palermo@tufts.edu") if you have questions or are interested in helping to organize the event.
