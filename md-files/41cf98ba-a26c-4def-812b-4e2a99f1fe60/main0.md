Program Description

Through lectures and hands-on laboratory investigations in state-of-the-art laboratories, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of disciplines such as molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, pharmacology, immunology, and other medical sciences. Students will learn how laboratory science can be translated into improved human health and will engage in investigative experiences that will allow them to apply their laboratory skills to real-life problems. In addition, students will interact with practicing professionals in fields such as medicine, physical therapy, toxicology, genetic counseling, and biomedical laboratory research. The Health and Biomedical Sciences Summer Camp will provide a fun, challenging, and engaging college environment in which students will develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be a biomedical scientist and health professional.

##### Camp Goals

The goal for this camp is not only to provide students with a window into the scientific basis of human health and medicine but also to offer them a glimpse of college life through an engaging and challenging academic experience.

Campers will live in a college residence hall, participate in lectures and laboratories in the state-of-the-art Neidig-Garber Science Center, and eat their meals at the student-loved Mund Dining Hall. Additionally, campers will be mentored by resident advisors who are current LVC science majors. Resident advisors are selected based on their expertise in the sciences, as well as their maturity and experience mentoring younger students.
