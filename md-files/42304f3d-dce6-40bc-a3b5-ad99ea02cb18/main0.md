## **Program Dates: July 6**–**August 14, 202**6

Summer Institute is a fast track to launching your environmental design career. Explore the methods and theories driving the field, experience the culture of design and planning studios, and develop a portfolio for job and graduate school applications with the expert guidance of faculty mentors.

Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, media workshops, and site visits. After fulfilling the program requirements, you’ll receive a certificate of completion and credit on an official UC Berkeley transcript. All classes are held in Bauer Wurster Hall, CED’s home on the UC Berkeley campus. International students are welcome and encouraged to apply.

**[Applications](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/#/Login) for 2026 are open.** We encourage you to **apply early.**

* **Virtual information session** for all Summer Institutes: March 10, 2026 at 5 PM Pacific Time. [Registration required](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed4q5D0hB3iyrjDMmn6yS0Cb8XntQMMvmYPOQUepST2pXf_A/viewform?usp=dialog).

## Choose your cohort

Choose from three different foundational programs — InArch, InCity, InLand — and jump-start your future in architecture, city planning, or landscape architecture. These post-baccalaureate programs are geared toward young professionals who are eager to explore career options in environmental design and are seeking to build a portfolio for graduate school. No previous design experience is required.

### INARCH

Immerse yourself in the foundational theories, philosophical principles, and technical practices of architectural design. Through studio instruction, faculty critiques, readings, and lectures, you’ll be introduced to architectural design, discourse, and representation.

[Learn More](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute/inarch)

Spacing: small

### InLand

Learn the fundamentals of landscape architectural practice through the process of making and experimentation. In a collaborative studio environment, you’ll engage with the concepts of ecology, public space, and sustainability at multiple scales of design.

[Learn More](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute/inland)

Spacing: small

### InCity

Gain practical, hands-on experience in sustainable city planning and urban design through projects based on real-world situations in the San Francisco Bay Area. You’ll develop in-depth recommendations, analyses, and proposals that address major themes of planning practice, including housing, transportation, and environmental justice.

“The InCity program was a supportive and friendly environment for me to take what I learned in college and apply it to real-world projects.”

After the program, Doug received a Master’s in Public Administration from New York University and worked for four years at ARUP. He is now assistant director of economic development & regional planning at the New York City Department of City Planning.

Doug Rose, InCity 2013

## Why Summer Institute?

* Learn the fundamentals of environmental design
* Experience the culture of design and planning studios
* Craft your graduate school portfolio under the guidance of faculty mentors
* Meet students on similar career tracks and connect with practitioners in the field
* Earn college-level credit on an official UC Berkeley transcript

Recent Summer Institute alums have been accepted to graduate programs at Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, Rice, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, MIT, University of Washington, University of Illinois, Princeton, Cornell, and Yale, among others.

Before the program Kaji was a gardener in Japan when he decided to learn more about what graduate studies in landscape architecture in the U.S. looks like. He is a landscape designer at Groundworks Office in Berkeley.

Kaji, (InLand 2018, MLA 2022)

## Typical Schedule

### Mondays–Thursdays

* Media skills workshops alternating with (guest) lectures: 10 a.m.–12 p.m.
* Lunch break: 12–1 p.m.
* Studio and discussions: 1–5 p.m.

### Fridays

* Site visit: 10 a.m.–2 p.m.

In addition, you’ll spend time in studio creating plans and models and refining designs in response to frequent feedback from instructors. The curriculum also provides opportunities for collaboration and group work.

**“The six-week program was well-organized, intensive, and beyond my expectations. I was introduced to using various media to develop and present my design thinking.”**

After the program, Lei earned an MDes degree at Harvard GSD and is now a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge.

Lei Song,
InArch 2017

* [Maria Paz de Moura Castro King](https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/maria-paz-de-moura-castro)

  Program Coordinator, CED Summer Institutes; Lecturer in Architecture

  Maria Paz de Moura Castro King is the founder of Brazil-based firm Rizoma and Bay Area-based firm PMCKM. Between the two practices, she has designed and built in a diverse range of scales, contexts and typologies, including art pavilions, showrooms, restaurants, single family houses, bus stations, institutional buildings, among others. King’s primary interest lies in the relationship and possible intersections between art and architecture, particularly in the implications the built space has in the construction of the art experience. King is a member of the International Council of Madame Architect, helping to find and spread the stories of many talented women architects around the world, especially those from Latin America. She earned her MArch from Cornell University.
* [Matt Kendall](https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/matt-kendall)

  Lecturer in Architecture

  Lead Instructor, InArch

  Matt Kendall is an architect focused on the creation of objects and spaces that are intrinsically diagrammatic, developing tectonic frameworks that align form, material, and concept. His practice engages top-down and bottom-up design methodologies, combining intuitive making with an adaptive, research-focused perspective. His process lies within the juncture between production and analysis, embracing the potential for iterative making to contextualize and shape narratives. He is heavily invested in digital tools, with an emphasis on parametric modeling, rendering, and representation. Matt’s professional experience includes work at Snøhetta, Iwamotoscott, Patterns, and Riken Yamamoto. He received his MArch from UCLA and his  BArch from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.
* Justin Kollar

  Lead Instructor, InCity

  Justin Kollar, PhD, AICP, is a planner, designer, and researcher whose work focuses on how large-scale infrastructures reshape urban form, land use, and territorial planning. He has led planning and urban design projects at Sasaki across the U.S., Vietnam, China, and Afghanistan, specializing in walkable urbanism, sustainability, and climate resilience. As a researcher at MIT’s City Form Lab, Kollar advanced studies of mobility, urban form, and spatial dynamics. He holds dual master’s degrees in Architecture and Urban Planning from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and completed his Ph.D. as a fellow at MIT’s Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism, where his research explored the spatial politics of infrastructure and resource governance.
