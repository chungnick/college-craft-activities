WHO CAN APPLY?

Anyone who is eligible can [apply](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) to the CED Summer Programs. Please refer to the main pages of the individual programs for specific eligibility criteria ([embARC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy), [DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities), and [Summer Institute](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute)) and to the [Application and Admissions page](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/application-registration). We encourage international students as well as minorities and first generation college students to apply.

WHAT ARE THE DATES FOR THE SUMMER 2025 PROGRAMS?

[embARC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy) Summer Design Academy: July 6 – 31, 2026 (4 weeks)

[DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities) (Design & Innovation for Sustainable Cities): July 6 – August 7, 2026 (5 weeks)

[Summer Institute in Environmental Design:](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute) July 6 – August 14, 2026 (6 weeks)

HOW DO I APPLY AND WHAT DO I NEED FOR THE APPLICATION?

Students must complete an [online application](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) via SlideRoom and pay the application fee before submitting their application. Applications open in mid-December. You can preview the application form by clicking on the link of your desired program and click “Preview Full Application” on the bottom of the page.

You can find the general application requirements for each of the summer programs on the [Application & Admissions page](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/application-registration).

Submission of **a portfolio is not required** to [apply](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) to a CED Summer Program.

I AM AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT. MAY I APPLY TO A CED SUMMER PROGRAM?

Yes, international students are encouraged to [apply](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) to the academic CED Summer Programs, based on eligibility. Once accepted to the on-campus program, UC Berkeley Summer Sessions will guide students through the steps of the [student visa application process](https://summer.berkeley.edu/visa). International students have to enroll in the course for five units of credit, which is the minimum amount required to be considered a full-time student and eligible for a visa. Please make note of [special deadlines](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines) for international students with visa requirements.

I AM ALREADY A UC BERKELEY STUDENT. CAN I JUST ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM?

We welcome UC Berkeley students to the [DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities) program — or under special circumstances to the [Summer Institute](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute). These academic CED Summer Programs, however, are intensive full-time programs and require a very high level of engagement and commitment. Therefore, we require you to formally [apply](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) and show your qualifications and interest. 

WHEN WILL I FIND OUT IF I’VE BEEN ACCEPTED?

Applications for [**DISC**](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities) and the [**Summer Institute**](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute) are reviewed for admission beginning in February. Admission letters are sent on a rolling basis about two to three weeks after applications are reviewed. Make sure to apply early in case the programs fill up.

The first review of [**embARC**](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy) applications is after the priority application deadline, which is also the deadline for scholarships and housing applications. We cannot guarantee that space will be available after this deadline, so we strongly recommend applying early. If you applied by the priority application deadline, you should hear from us within approximately two weeks of submitting your application.

All admission decisions are sent via email. Please check your spam folder!

I MISSED THE APPLICATION DEADLINE AND REALLY WANT TO JOIN A PROGRAM THIS SUMMER. WHAT CAN I DO?

If you are a domestic student, there may still be a chance for you to [apply](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) as long as the program has not started yet and space is available. Please send an email with your inquiry to the CED Summer Program of interest — [embARC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy), [DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities), or [Summer Institute](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute) (see the bottom of the respective program page for the email address). 

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I AM AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT AND WANT TO JOIN A PROGRAM THIS SUMMER, BUT I MISSED THE APPLICATION DEADLINE?

International students who miss the application deadline (and who do not already have a valid visa allowing them to attend a university over the summer) will need to wait until next year to apply. 

International students who missed the application deadline but who already have a valid student visa or permanent residency should contact the CED Summer Program of interest,  [embARC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy), [DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities), or [Summer Institute](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute) (see the bottom of the respective program page for the email address). 

*If you are unclear about your visa status, please refer to  the [UC Berkeley Summer Sessions website](https://summer.berkeley.edu/international/are-you-an-international-student).*

IS THE COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIRED?

To support the health and well-being of our campus and the community, the University of California strongly recommends that all members of the uiniversity community follow vaccine recommendations adopted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) applicable to their age, medical condition, and other relevant indications.

For more details, information about exemptions, and to find out if requirements have changed, see [University Health Services.](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/requirements/covid19)

Compliance with the COVID-19 policy will be required prior to enrollment in classes.

DO I NEED TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN CED SUMMER PROGRAMS?

Health insurance coverage is strongly recommended to meet unexpected health expenses when you attend an on-campus program. If you don’t have one, you should purchase a health insurance policy before you arrive in Berkeley.

**International students**: J-1 students are required as a condition of their status to maintain a strict and certain minimum level of coverage from the day that they are admitted to the U.S. For more information on J-1 health insurance requirements, see [Health Insurance Requirements for J-1/J-2 Visitors](http://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/j_insurance). If insurance cannot be purchased before leaving home, information about health insurance enrollment can be obtained from the [UHS website.](http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/insurance/internationalsummersessions.shtml)

IMPORTANT: Many insurance plans are now excluding COVID-19 coverage due to CDC travel warnings and/or U.S Department of State travel warnings. However, there are many insurance plans that would cover COVID-19 treatment expenses just like any other new medical condition that occurs after the effective date of the policy. Students are required to make sure that their insurance plan covers COVID-19 related expenses.

WHAT IS THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM?

Information regarding the cost of CED Summer Programs can be found on the [Deadlines & Fees page](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines).

IS THERE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT OFFERED FOR CED SUMMER PROGRAMS?

A small number of scholarships and stipends are available to accepted students with U.S. citizenship or residency. The awards are based on financial need. CED Summer Program financial support is not federally subsidized. Applicants have the opportunity to request financial aid when filling out the [SlideRoom](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/#/Login)  application for their program of interest. The SlideRoom program application must be submitted **before** the [scholarship deadline](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines) to be considered for financial aid.

CAN I APPLY TO THE PROGRAM AFTER I KNOW WHETHER I WILL RECEIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT?

No. The [program application](https://cedberkeley.slideroom.com/) (through which financial support is requested) must be submitted **before** the [financial support application deadline](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines). Requests for financial support will not be considered without a completed program application.

I AM NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COVER THE FULL COST OF THE PROGRAM. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

Applicants and admitted students are encouraged to research and apply for additional funding opportunities, which might include funds from your home school/college/university, foundations, your government, regional scholarship funds, or stipends based on other criteria. A College Savings Plan (529 Plan) or the AmeriCorp Education Award may be an option, too.

Other funding possibilities could include support from an employer, local business, civic organization, an institution of worship, or a loan supplement. We also had students who have succeeded in fundraising, for example through a crowd-funding campaign. We encourage you to investigate all options.

In addition, you may review this [list of scholarship databases](https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/scholarship-databases/). It primarily applies to full-time students, but you may find an opportunity that applies to your personal situation.

CAN I WORK DURING THE PROGRAM?

We strongly discourage CED Summer Program students from working during their participation in our on-campus programs. This is because our on-campus summer programs run on a full-time schedule. Further, homework and class preparation are required, as well as a student’s full commitment.

ARE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT?

Financial aid awarded by CED Summer Programs is available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.

We recommend international students check for financial funding opportunities offered through their home country. International students might be able to apply for funds in their home college/university. Many countries have their own options, such as foundations that may offer financial support for international exchange and university visits. We encourage you to research online or through your college/university for potential funding opportunities.

I MISSED THE DEADLINE FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT APPLICATION. WHAT CAN I DO?

In rare circumstances, exceptions to the financial support application deadline can be made IF there are still funds available and depending on the personal circumstances of the student. Contact the CED Summer Program of your choice with further questions.

## Course Credit

* Will I earn credit?
* Can I transfer credit from CED Summer Programs to my college?
* I am on a quarter system. How does semester credit relate?

WILL I EARN CREDIT?

Upon successful completion of one of the academic CED Summer programs, students will generally earn one semester unit of college credit on an official UC Berkeley transcript. International students who need to qualify for a student visa will need to enroll in 5 semester units which they will earn upon successful completion of the program.

Students also have the option to add additional college-level semester units for consideration at their home school. Whether these credits will fulfill any degree requirements on an undergraduate level is solely at the discretion of the institution the student attends. Students will need to contact their advisor of their home institution.

CAN I TRANSFER CREDIT FROM CED SUMMER PROGRAMS TO MY COLLEGE?

Consult with your home institution regarding transfer of CED Summer Programs coursework. Be prepared to provide course descriptions, syllabi, transcripts, and other course information as required by your home institution.

I AM ON A QUARTER SYSTEM. HOW DOES SEMESTER CREDIT RELATE?

Please refer to the [UC Berkeley Summer Sessions website](https://summer.berkeley.edu/student-services/units-grades) to learn more about units of credits and how to convert them to the quarter system.

## How to Prepare

* Will I need to bring my own laptop?
* Will I need to set aside time before the program starts for readings or other preparations?
* Where can I purchase materials and supplies?
* How should I dress for studio, final presentations, and site visits?
* How can I request accommodations if I have a disability?

WILL I NEED TO BRING MY OWN LAPTOP?

It is recommended that students of the academic CED Summer programs bring a laptop with a functional built-in or add-on camera (the camera is recommended in case remote presentation or participation becomes necessary). Upon completion of enrollment, certain software becomes available to students. Students will also have access to computers, printers, and any required graphic or technical software in the CED computing labs. 

Additionally, some instructors recommend bringing a mouse, as it may help to work with details in the design programs (particularly on a Windows laptop).

WILL I NEED TO SET ASIDE TIME BEFORE THE PROGRAM STARTS FOR READINGS OR OTHER PREPARATIONS?

Students enrolled in an academic CED Summer program will receive instructions to fill out waivers and other forms and they will also be **required** to complete various tasks via their [CalCentral](https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/) student accounts.

In addition, most instructors will request that students install certain software before their arrival in class. Some instructors will also ask students to prepare mandatory readings and a few assignments before the course starts.

We will send all necessary instructions before the start of the course.

WHERE CAN I PURCHASE MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES?

Most materials will be provided to program participants in the Design + Build Bootcamp, embARC, and DISC courses. Additional supplies are available for purchase at the CED [Materials Store](https://ced.berkeley.edu/resources/fabrication-materials/materials-store), [The Ink Stone](https://theinkstone.com) close to campus, and various other stores in Berkeley.

If your instructors want you to purchase any materials before the first day of the program, they will send a list ahead of time.

HOW SHOULD I DRESS FOR STUDIO, FINAL PRESENTATIONS, AND SITE VISITS?

Students should wear comfortable clothing and shoes for regular studio course days. In studio, long hair should be pulled back and students should refrain from wearing jewelry that dangles, such as long necklaces or large earrings. This also applies to students of the Design + Build Bootcamp, as they will be working in the wood and metal shop every day.

For site visits, it is recommended that students bring a sketchbook, sun protection (a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen), warm clothing for foggy temperatures in the 50’s, a water bottle, a lunch and snacks, and their Clipper Card (which will be provided at the beginning of the program).

Students participating in the DISC program should also bring the handbook issued on the first day of the program. Also, professional business attire or neat clothing is recommended for some field trips and final presentations.

HOW CAN I REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS IF I HAVE A DISABILITY?

Accommodations and services are requested through the [UC Berkeley Disabled Students’ Program (DSP)](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students). Students must go through an [application process](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students/application-process) in order to receive services. Since the application process involves various steps, you should submit your accommodations request to DSP several weeks before the programs starts.

Spacing: small

## Housing & Transportation

* How do I find housing?
* How much does housing cost?
* Can I use public transportation to get to campus?
* Do you have student parking on campus?

HOW DO I FIND HOUSING?

In consideration of the significant time commitment required by the on-campus CED Summer Programs, students are encouraged to live on or close to campus.

**DISC and Summer Institute students**: There are many options for housing, which are summarized [here](https://summer.berkeley.edu/student-services/student-housing), linking to different housing sites. If you like to stay in the student dorms, we recommend reserving a space as soon as possible, as the dorms tend to fill up in the summer. All classes take place in Bauer Wurster Hall, which is located at the southeast corner of the main campus.

**embARC students** under 18 who are in need of housing must sign up for campus housing through the embARC program — please review the embARC Housing section under the embARC program FAQ.

HOW MUCH DOES HOUSING COST?

The cost of housing will depend on the length of the program and the type of accommodation you choose. [View options.](https://summer.berkeley.edu/student-services/student-housing) 

If you are a minor and choose the housing option with embARC, find the [cost here](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines).

CAN I USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO CAMPUS?

Yes! Many students use public transportation to get to campus every day. The public transit system in the East Bay is well-developed, and rail transit connects to San Francisco as well. Learn more about [Bay Area public transportation](https://pt.berkeley.edu/transit).

Students of the academic CED Summer programs will be able to use the local bus system for free, with a Clipper Card. If you have provided all requested information, the Clipper Card will be handed out to you with your Cal1Card at the beginning of the program.

Design + Build Bootcamp students will not receive a Clipper Card and have to arrange for their own transportation.

While students can also use a bicycle to get around, you should note that Bauer Wurster Hall is located on the east side of campus which is somewhat elevated over the west side and Berkeley downtown.

DO YOU HAVE STUDENT PARKING ON CAMPUS?

Students use the parking structures that are available for all university staff, faculty, and students. You can find more information on parking fees and public transportation options on the [UC Berkeley Parking and Transportation website](https://pt.berkeley.edu/home). Students enrolled in one of the academic CED Summer programs can also use the local bus system as well as the UC Berkeley perimeter bus line for free.

## Cancellation & Withdrawal

* My plans have changed. How do I cancel my enrollment or withdraw from the program?
* What is the refund policy?

MY PLANS HAVE CHANGED. HOW DO I CANCEL MY ENROLLMENT OR WITHDRAW FROM THE PROGRAM?

If you do not plan to attend and you are already enrolled in a CED Summer Program, you must drop your course(s) before the [refund deadlines](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines) or you will be financially responsible for tuition and fees. To do this, you will need to do **both** of the following:

1) Send an email to your CED Summer Program ([embARC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy), [DISC](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/disc-design-innovation-for-sustainable-cities), [Summer Institute)](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/summer-institute) to inform us that you need to withdraw.

2) Complete a withdrawal application through [CalCentral](https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/).

**Important:** CED Summer Programs students are **not** automatically dropped from classes for non-payment or non-attendance in the summer term and are financially responsible for all fees unless they drop their course(s) **before** the refund deadlines. If you decide to enroll in a CED Summer Program after the refund deadline has passed, you automatically accept financial responsibility for the program fees.

Please take a note of the CED Summer Programs fee [refund deadlines](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines). Information regarding the Summer Sessions fee refund deadline is available [here.](https://summer.berkeley.edu/enrollment-changes/dropping-all-your-courses)

WHAT IS THE REFUND POLICY?

CED reserves the right to cancel any course for which there is insufficient enrollment. If CED cancels a Summer Program course, students already enrolled will receive a full refund. 

For student-initiated cancellations, you must adhere to the cancellation deadlines to receive a refund. The CED Summer Programs tuition refund deadline information is available [here.](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines)  

**Important:** If you do not plan to attend, you must drop your class(es) before the refund deadlines, or you will be financially responsible for the fees. CED Summer Program students are not automatically dropped from classes for non-payment or non-attendance in the summer term. Enrolling in a CED Summer Program after the full refund cancellation deadline  automatically implies that you accept financial responsibility for the program fees.

Spacing: small

## embARC General FAQ

* Do I need to have experience in design or architecture to participate in the embARC program?
* Is there an age requirement for the embARC program?
* What if I don’t meet the embARC age requirement?
* Will participating in the embARC program help me to build a portfolio that I can use for my college applications?
* How heavy is the workload?
* Can I request accommodations on the basis of disability?
* What materials are included in the cost of the embARC program?
* What are the technology requirements of the program?

DO I NEED TO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN DESIGN OR ARCHITECTURE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EMBARC PROGRAM?

Students participating in the program have a range of experiences, from taking no art or design classes to having taken many. Although students come to the embARC program from various backgrounds, they all share a common interest in learning about the fields of architecture and design.

IS THERE AN AGE REQUIREMENT FOR THE EMBARC PROGRAM?

**Yes, there is an age requirement. You must be 16 years old by the first day of the program to participate.** Per UC Berkeley policy, we cannot make any exceptions or provide a waiver to the age requirement.

WHAT IF I DON’T MEET THE EMBARC AGE REQUIREMENT?

If you don’t meet the age requirement by the program start date, we recommend looking at the [Academic Talent Development Program (ATDP)](https://atdp.berkeley.edu/) or [Berkeley Business Academy for Youth](https://haas.berkeley.edu/business-academy/). Note that these programs fall outside of the purview of CED Summer Programs and Pre-College Scholars.

WILL PARTICIPATING IN THE EMBARC PROGRAM HELP ME TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO THAT I CAN USE FOR MY COLLEGE APPLICATIONS?

embARC students complete the program with individual projects from the Digital Design Workshops and Architecture + Design Studio, as well as group work from the Sustainable Planning Workshop and the Community Build. Student work is digitally archived and can be included in a portfolio for college applications.

HOW HEAVY IS THE WORKLOAD?

embARC is a condensed, highly rigorous version of a college-level design course and therefore requires a significant time commitment. Participants should expect to work in/out of the studio after instruction hours on some weeknights and weekends, as they would in any college degree program in the field of environmental design.

CAN I REQUEST ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY?

Yes, admitted students can request accommodations on the basis of a disability. Accommodations and services are requested through the [UC Berkeley Disabled Students’ Program (DSP)](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students). Students must go through an [application process](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students/application-process) in order to receive services. Since the application process involves various steps, you should submit your accommodations request to DSP several weeks before the programs starts.

WHAT MATERIALS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF THE EMBARC PROGRAM?

The following materials are provided to students as part of the cost of the program, including: 

* Triangle arch scale
* Lead holder
* Mini pointer
* Lead pencils in various grades and sizes
* Sketch book
* X-ACTO knife
* Vinyl eraser
* Clear triangles

Students should expect to spend about an additional $100 on supplies for specific assignments. These supplies can be purchased by students at the [CED Materials Store](https://ced.berkeley.edu/resources/fabrication-materials/materials-store) or near campus at [The Ink Stone](https://theinkstone.com/) in Berkeley.

WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM?

The following technology will be needed for use during the program:

* **Cell phone** – so that we can reach you in an emergency and for technology access using the UC Berkeley two-factor authentication (2FA)
* **Camera** – using the camera on your cell phone is fine also
* **Laptop** – you cannot use a Chromebook or Microsoft Surface since these devices are unable to install the design software required for the course

We strongly encourage bringing a laptop (although embARC students have access to the CED computer lab, the number of computers available is limited). The lab computers are equipped with all the software needed for the program.

The following software will be used: [Photoshop](https://berkeley-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2jjYw8YRo0YPQMh27Fs62HTHRCwhKe7lf3kk5WX3urSPIigH_iAGNlMPQ_nv_ZLSQR3opJpf6g69ENB0qsUTTpjmHJcocn0h5nHrZJGY0FDpSKOCaiHZEJ4WQ9O20iC7Sj9l1pLzEEgW794jNPGudC4K0PulHV4FUsZGFK4WZOwmk4LdRBd8griWfY1geXmWGYbSiQ_N0SSBmomHdyZs), [InDesign,](https://berkeley-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2aMBaPToqi2C9YW6g3UDfoRUR6HDCm7NAmXDbyuiVfNHMigH_iAE_KRLekVu4Tgf-jrYhoBJFPFSFreMis32jQb46QkVNkSxx3C0ZDt733T1HUK7HgaHEtowP_SQKbZRT6jfK7LaKca4W0iDII5h3POAGkXNTQV4EvJbc6SjDxAkDD-bMHU84XqOOkOIKK8FhgOMmRHMvHq_lj6fY) [Illustrator,](https://berkeley-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2q-ncbXiblCG7EFOdH2-x4Ae3WjXRK_zKz_TQ1lukFLTQigH_iAGlZcb7YN1NY9ubk2ayjq8t0JMyN5eaE6mBplbe3LeSgR5EUFmuAsN7njzABI59v6u055J4bCecr1nUWs0CfBnIePE4iDyKurEAJ0gdAjB_chj9z-Rj4vHab2BXUSaAg2CSDFY3oQSL-WUSJURaksfiRCZfAh1l2w8d) and [Rhino](https://berkeley-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2lz8PQWAnO_7wvWOZSG1e-c0bTyJvQLiqTbz2y1iR2o3TigH_iAEJchV7iiVbI9dTZ0q1b48HUHueKcygxrzP4ZQSrcBiipu-zw6jBiSE1Q9W36PTUIaIw9VOgPYfIY1dFqZz4jSt0B_mkquZ72fL7GyzF5iJM0rJze_mDRNEiybgefIcAST6yg) (click on each program for information on technical specifications).

## embARC Housing

* Do I need to live on campus?
* Where will students stay on campus?
* How secure is the residence hall?
* What is included in residential housing?
* What happens on the weekends?
* How are dietary needs or restrictions handled?
* How are medical needs handled?

DO I NEED TO LIVE ON CAMPUS?

Students living within 45 minutes of the UC Berkeley campus may opt to commute to embARC as a day student. Non-local students must request on campus housing, or reside with a local guardian, relative, or someone officially sanctioned in writing by the student’s parent/guardian at the time of registration.

**IMPORTANT**: The number of residential students we can accommodate in the embARC program is limited. embARC participants wishing to live on campus must request housing by the posted deadline as indicated on our website’s [Deadlines & Fees](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines) page. Students must be 16 by July 5, 2026, to reside in embARC housing.

WHERE WILL STUDENTS STAY ON CAMPUS?

CED Summer Programs partners with UC Berkeley Pre-College Scholars to manage the campus housing component of the embARC program. The student residence hall is located on the UC Berkeley campus within walking distance to the College of Environmental Design, which is located in Bauer Wurster Hall on the southeast side of campus. Students stay in an on-campus residence hall with a shared bathroom on their floor. Each bedroom is furnished with a bed, desk, chair, mattress, and dresser drawers. The residence hall also has wireless internet access available for the residents. Roommates are randomly assigned prior to your arrival. Pre-College Scholars cannot honor any roommate requests. The dorm rooms are either single, double, or triple-occupancy. Students are grouped in rooms by gender.

HOW SECURE IS THE RESIDENCE HALL?

In order to gain access to their residence hall, students are given a key to open the outer gate as well as all doors inside the building. The rooms are separated by gender, and Resident Assistant and Mentors (RAMs) reside on the floor with the student residents in order to provide evening supervision and to be available throughout the night in the event of an emergency. Students must abide by a daily curfew from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Residential staff take roll every evening at 10:00 PM. After the evening room check is completed, student residents are asked not to leave their rooms for the remainder of the night for any reason other than emergencies or for necessary restroom visits on their floor.

WHAT IS INCLUDED IN RESIDENTIAL HOUSING?

The cost of residential tuition covers:

* Overnight accommodation in the student residence hall on campus.
* Supervision, orientation, extracurricular activities, basic health insurance, and on-site support from the official dorm move-in to move-out date.
* A meal plan that offers 3 meals per day during weekdays, weekends, and on holidays. (During weekdays, if a student can’t eat in the dining area because they have to get to class, or they simply would like to eat later, they can request that their meal be saved.)
* Weekend excursions off-campus, and organized evening activities if students have completed their classroom/studio assignments.

WHAT HAPPENS ON THE WEEKENDS?

Students will be expected to work over the weekend to complete embARC assignments. However, our UC Berkeley Pre-College Scholar staff will organize weekend excursions. Any additional free time may be spent at the discretion of the student. There are many activities and attractions in the Bay Area; however, students will need to return to their residence hall before the evening roll call.

HOW ARE DIETARY NEEDS OR RESTRICTIONS HANDLED?

Students enrolled in the embARC program will be given 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) that will be uploaded to their meal card. If a student has special dietary needs, please indicate this on our optional Medical Information Form. UC Berkeley Pre-College Scholars staff will provide dining hall staff with a list of dietary needs and restrictions to help coordinate needs. For more information regarding dining hall services please visit <https://dining.berkeley.edu/menus/>.

HOW ARE MEDICAL NEEDS HANDLED?

Students staying in campus housing who have special medical needs, or who plan on bringing medication, should indicate this information on our optional Medical Information Form. While providing information about a medical condition is voluntary, students are encouraged to disclose any accommodations (physical, mental, academic, etc.) they may need during the program. UC Berkeley Pre-College Scholars will work with the student through this interactive process to provide reasonable accommodations to the extent possible given the time at which the accommodation request is made. Generally, we ask families to equip their student to store and administer their medication individually. We do not take possession of medication or administer medication directly to a student.

## embARC Attendance

* What is your attendance policy?

WHAT IS YOUR ATTENDANCE POLICY?

embARC is a fast-paced program and important information is covered in every class. Students are expected to attend every class and be present every day for all four weeks of the program. Students who anticipate missing too much class time will not be allowed to attend the program. If it is inevitable that a student must miss a day or two in the program the student will be expected to clear the absence with their instructor ahead of time and it will be the student’s responsibility to check with their instructor about making up any missed work or assignments. Any anticipated absence or tardiness must also be reported to the embARC Administrative Team at embarc@berkeley.edu.
