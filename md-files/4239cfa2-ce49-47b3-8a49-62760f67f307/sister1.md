[Apply Now](https://ugadmission.bentley.edu/portal/PCP )

Eligibility Requirements
:   Applicants are expected to meet the following minimum eligibility requirements:

    * Applicants who have not completed at least two years of high school in the U.S. must demonstrate English language proficiency.
    * Students must be 16 years old by September 1 of the program year to live in the residence halls. High School students younger can be commuter students or take online Wall Street 101 courses.

    **Wall Street 101 applicants only:** We offer five courses, each lasting a week. The courses are:

    * FinTech for Startups
    * Global Finance and Trade
    * Macroeconomics and Financial Markets
    * Personal Finance
    * Stock Market and Investment Research

    As long as you are passionate about financial literacy, you should apply. Specifically, a basic familiarity with the stock market is recommended for the Stock Market and Investment Research. Students unfamiliar with capital markets may find the courses challenging at first; however, intellectually curious students with a passion for learning something new and valuable have completed the courses in the past. A basic level of proficiency in Excel or Google Sheets is helpful for each course. We provide quick tutorials on Excel and Google Sheets.

Application Requirements
:   Create an account to access the online application. You will be asked about your high school curriculum (overall GPA and grades in relevant courses) and activities, and you will respond to an optional essay question. Upload a copy of your unofficial transcript (required). If you are requesting financial aid, you will need to work with the parent or guardian who claims you as a dependent to provide tax documents. You may save your work and return to the application later. The $75 application fee will be collected when you submit your application. No further changes can be made once you submit.

    Admitted students will be asked to provide additional information, including the Health Insurance and Bentley University Liability forms that must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.

Scholarships do not include travel funds and no support for VISA applications is provided to international students. International students interested in scholarship will be asked to fill out a form to demonstrate their financial need beyond a tax return that they may not be able to submit.

Participant Policies
:   Admitted students will receive further details about policies and procedures governing participation in the Pre-College Program, which must be signed by the student, and the parent/legal guardian of students below the age of 18. A summary of these policies is included here for reference in the application process.

    **Student Conduct**

    Bentley is a community of students, faculty and staff committed to learning, intellectual growth, social well-being, and civic responsibility. To create the best environment for learning, we, as a community, embrace the Bentley core values to guide our conduct.

    At registration, students will sign a personal conduct policy agreeing to adhere to all policies to make the program fun, educational, and safe for all participants. All participants in our programs are treated as responsible young adults and are expected to behave in a manner that respects and considers the rights of others in the community. 

    Professors and teaching assistants for each course are available to help you navigate the materials, projects, and management of classroom behavior. Residence Directors and Resident Assistants are available to help you navigate the university environment, get to know other participants, and management of behavior outside of the classroom. We make every effort to address issues proactively, fairly, and quickly where possible. Any violations of the code of conduct are managed on an individual basis and may be grounds for dismissal from the program with no refund provided. 

    **Zoom Etiquette**

    We will issue an official ID for access to Zoom and other software.  You cannot share the session Zoom access and password with anyone.  Sharing Zoom access code and password with others will violate program policies, and you will be expelled from the session.  Your microphone should always be muted if you are not participating in class discussions.

    **Licensed Software**

    Students will be given official access to Zoom, Blackboard, and online databases (Bloomberg, FactSet, Morningstar Direct, and CapIQ) licensed by Bentley University for educational purposes only; students are not to use their access for any purposes outside the scope of the Wall Street 101 Program.

    **Redistributing Course Content**

    Lectures and instructional materials shared with you during your session are intellectual properties of Bentley University. Unauthorized reproduction and distribution are strictly prohibited.

Steps after Admission
:   After admission into the program and payment of the tuition, enrolled students and their parents will be given separate online portals to complete forms and waivers. These forms must be completed by June 1 or applications may be cancelled. The separate portals for enrolled students require parents and students to complete forms.
