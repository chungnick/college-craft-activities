# Explorations in Architecture and Design

Explorations in Architecture and Design is a pre-college program for rising juniors and seniors interested in analyzing the fundamentals of design and thinking at the architectural scale. Students delve into ideas, methods, and issues of the built environment in the unmatched cultural context of New Orleans. This studio-based program - offered through Tulane's School of Architecture and Built Environment - encourages participants to investigate the world around them from the design perspective and engage in lectures, studio time, field trips, discussions, and critiques.

## Unleash your creativity and design your future.

Drawing from the unique urban landscape of New Orleans, you will discover how architecture blends history and culture and examine the intersection of visual orientation, academic investigation, and professional training that forms a design education. Tulane faculty will help you develop a set of projects through models and drawings resulting in a robust portfolio that you can use for college applications. As an added support, you can opt into open studio hours after class to learn more from your Teaching Assistants, who are all current Tulane Architecture students, and work on projects at your individual studio desk.

## How to Apply

Applicants should be rising 11th and 12th graders who have a strong interest in architecture and design. No specialized knowledge or background is needed. Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis; you are encouraged to apply early to ensure a seat in your preferred course.

You will need the following items for your online application:

* A copy of your full high school transcript (official or unofficial)
* An essay explaining your interest in your selected courses
* A teacher recommendation

Financial aid for tuition is awarded based on demonstrated need, and priority is given to Louisiana residents. **Students who enroll in multiple courses and do not receive financial aid are eligible for a 10% discount**. If you need assistance completing your application or have questions about aid, email [summer@tulane.edu](mailto:summer@tulane.edu) for more information.

## Summer 2026 Courses

Each course is offered for three hours of Tulane credit, which may be transferable to another university. Students can use three credits as an architectural elective towards an undergraduate degree in the Tulane School of Architecture and Built Environment. In addition to class time, students have access to their assigned studio desk to work on assignments during open studio from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.
