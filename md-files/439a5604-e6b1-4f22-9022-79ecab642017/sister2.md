# Tuition + Aid

Tulane Pre-College Programs offer a variety of courses and experiences. Program costs are dependent upon the course and experience types, whether that be enrichment or credit-bearing classes as a commuter or residential participant. Students and families may request financial aid within the application, where priorities and eligibilities are detailed. There is no fee to apply to the program to ensure all students can gain access to a high-quality pre-collegiate education.

## More Information

Payments

A 10% non-refundable deposit is due within two weeks of acceptance to Tulane Pre-College Programs to reserve your space. All remaining tuition and fees must be paid in full by May 15th.

Financial accounts will be settled through your student or parent portal. Partial payments can be made prior to the May 15th deadline.

For questions on how to pay your balance or how to access your student or parent portal, please contact our office at [summer@tulane.edu](mailto:summer@tulane.edu).

Financial Aid

Tulane Pre-College Programs work to support motivated students with demonstrated financial need. Limited aid is available and is awarded to families in need of assistance. The Financial Aid Committee, which operates independently of Tulane University’s Financial Aid office, awards scholarships as generously and equitably as possible; however, funding for financial aid is limited and the demand is great. In determining need, the committee considers a number of variables, including family finances, family size, and geographic differences in the cost of living. Priority is given to Louisiana residents.

Financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it is to your advantage to apply as early as possible. We cannot guarantee that all eligible applicants will receive aid. In most cases, financial aid does not cover all expenses; students must contribute to the cost of attending a program and are encouraged to seek other sources of funding. The aid a student may receive is nontransferable between programs and can only be used for the requested session. Please note that financial aid for international students is only available for credit-bearing courses.

You can apply for financial assistance as a part of your application to Tulane Pre-College Programs. Contact our office at [summer@tulane.edu](mailto:summer@tulane.edu) for more information.

Louisiana Promise Scholarship

Louisiana students applying to the two-week residential experience may be eligible for the [Louisiana Promise No Loan Scholarship](https://admission.tulane.edu/tuition-aid/louisiana-residents) funded through the University. Tulane will provide full funding for 50 residential students. Applicants will need to have primary residence within the state of Louisiana and apply for financial aid within the Tulane Pre-College Programs application. Financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it is to your advantage to apply as early as possible.

Discounts

Tulane Pre-College Programs offer a 10% discount to our pre-college alumni, dependents of Tulane alumni, dependents of Tulane faculty and staff, participants who enroll in multiple sessions, and families who enroll multiple siblings in our programming. Please note the 10% discount cannot be combined with each other (i.e., an applicant can only claim one type of 10% discount). These discounts are only available to participants who are not awarded financial aid.

Dependent Tuition Waiver

Eligible Tulane employees may utilize the dependent tuition waiver benefit for credit-bearing courses offered through Tulane Pre-College Programs. The dependent tuition waiver covers the tuition cost but does not cover meal plans, housing, and residential life costs. For Summer 2026, commuter students using the dependent tuition waiver will be responsible for paying $300 to cover meals and fees; residential students using the dependent tuition waiver will be responsible for paying $4,300 to cover room and board, fees, and residential life activities.

Enrichment courses are not offered for credit and are not eligible for the dependent tuition waiver benefit. Tulane employees are eligible for a 10% discount on enrichment courses.

Applicants to credit-bearing courses must express their intention to use the dependent tuition waiver benefit in their application. Eligible employees must request the dependent tuition waiver in Gibson per the directions and waiver schedule posted by Human Resources. [More information on the dependent tuition waiver benefit can be found on the Human Resources website.](https://hr.tulane.edu/tuition-waiver)

Refund Policies

The 10% deposit is non-refundable, but the remaining program fee will be refunded if a student chooses to cancel their attendance prior to May 15, 2026. No refunds will be given after May 15, 2026.

All program changes must be requested in writing by email to [summer@tulane.edu](mailto:summer@tulane.edu) at least 14 days prior to the program start date. Our office will try our best to honor program changes but cannot guarantee the change can be made. Students may not change courses once the session begins.

If a student wishes to withdraw from their program, they must notify Tulane Pre-College Programs in writing by email to [summer@tulane.edu](mailto:summer@tulane.edu). A student may withdraw only with permission and approval from the Program Director. The effective date of withdrawal is the date official written notification is received by Tulane Pre-College Programs.

All students registered for a course must be in attendance on or before the second day of class. Otherwise, registration will be canceled.

Our tuition refund policies apply to all students regardless of the date of application or the circumstances.

Cancellation Policy

Tulane Pre-College Programs reserve the right to change or cancel any course if conditions warrant. Notification will be provided as early as possible should this be necessary. Should a course be canceled due to low enrollment numbers, other course options will be offered, or refunds will be processed.

Tulane University reserves the right to dismiss any participant, without reimbursement of payment, who is unable to adhere to the Tulane Pre-College Programs Code of Student Conduct or is disruptive in any other way. Understanding that pre-college participants are minors, the University employs specific rules and expectations to promote a safe and productive learning environment. Tulane may, in its sole discretion, require any participant who has violated the University’s policies to leave the program at the participant’s expense. All parents and participants are encouraged to read carefully the Tulane Pre-College Programs Code of Student Conduct agreement included in the enrollment paperwork and in the handbook.
