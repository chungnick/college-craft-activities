## Program FAQs

Who can attend Tulane Pre-College Programs?

Tulane Pre-College Programs accept students entering the 9th through 12th-grade for our enrichment courses. Credit-bearing courses are open to rising juniors and seniors.

For our residential experience, you must be at least 14 years old by the first day of your session.

Why are some of the courses noncredit?

Our noncredit enrichment courses allow high school students the experience of exploring college-level academic subjects without the pressure of exams and grades. Students who successfully complete an enrichment course receive a certificate of completion.

Will there be homework outside of class?

Credit-bearing courses are designed to mirror Tulane undergraduate courses and have assignments outside of class. The amount of daily homework varies among courses and may take up to several hours per day, but previous pre-college students have found these assignments manageable and rewarding. Students in enrichment courses have minimal work to complete outside of class.

What is a typical pre-college academic day like?

Students' academic day starts with a college workshop at 9:00 a.m. Students then attend class from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. with an hourlong lunch break. Credit-bearing courses typically consist of class lectures in the morning and lab/studio in the afternoon. Enrichment courses often include field excursions and guest speakers related to the academic content of the course.

Architecture students have open studio from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. to utilize specialized materials for assignments at their personal studio desks. Additionally, all students can engage in drop-in social programming from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.

What is the university's policy regarding participants with disabilities?
