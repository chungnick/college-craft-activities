# College Edge: Summer

In the College Edge program, students in grades 11–12 truly get the college experience by earning college credit as they learn alongside Columbia’s undergrad students on our Morningside campus. Students will also receive academic advisement and professional development opportunities.

Watch the video below for more details about the program.

## Academics

> The College Edge experience has allowed me to become more hard-working than I ever thought I could be, and I have made so many friends with such focus and drive."

### Courses

College Edge courses differ from our other pre-college programs in that students enroll in real college courses to earn credit—which means they will register for courses. When selecting course load, plan to spend two to three hours of study outside class for every hour spent in class.

### World-Class Faculty

Our diverse and international faculty are experts in their fields. They are committed to sharing their knowledge, insight, and experience with students.

## Student Life

Perhaps more than any other of our pre-college programs, learning goes beyond the classroom with College Edge. In this program, students prepare for college by experiencing college: they enroll in university courses to earn credit alongside undergraduate students; they will discover more about themselves in order to better understand their own values and strengths—and they will learn how to eloquently communicate who they are and what they stand for. Our dedicated Student Life team creates unique and effective workshops exploring these themes and more to help students prepare for both college and career, develop leadership skills, and make lasting connections with peers from all over the world.

### Campus Resources

Besides, of course, having New York City at our doorstep, Morningside Campus has an extensive amount of resources. Most of these are available to active students with a Columbia University ID.

### College Preparation

Students are invited to attend seminars, workshops, and lectures to prepare for the academic rigors of university life. Our faculty and staff will help you prepare—and succeed.­­
