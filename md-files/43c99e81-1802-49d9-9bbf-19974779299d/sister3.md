### Payment Procedures

Columbia bills students for tuition, fees, and other charges at the beginning of each term. The Student Account Statement is distributed electronically via email notification to a student’s Columbia University email account. No paper bills will be mailed by the University.

Columbia University reserves the right to withhold the privilege of registration, or any other University privilege, from any person with unpaid debt to the University.

### Billing Process

Columbia University bills students for tuition and fees according to the [Columbia University billing schedule](https://sfs.columbia.edu/content/billing-schedule). When a statement is generated, an email notification is sent directly to your Columbia email account. You can also access a copy of the bill through [Student Services Online](https://ssol.columbia.edu) (SSOL). **The University does not mail paper bills.**

After the first statement is generated, bills will be generated periodically if you make schedule changes or if you carry an account balance.
