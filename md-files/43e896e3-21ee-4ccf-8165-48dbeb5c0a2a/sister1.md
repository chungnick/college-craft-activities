## Student life

###### Sample classes and activities

It's easier to show than tell what SPARC's curriculum is like. Here are some examples of classes and activities that we have held in the past.

###### Classes

Classes are taught in groups of 6-8 students. Most classes are discussion-based, though some are more traditional lectures and others are centered on exercises.

Noticing

We ignore 95% of what happens around us. Noticing is a mindfulness practice to become more in tune with our surroundings.

Cognitive biases

Learn about all the funny things your brain does, techniques to counteract bias, and how you will never truly overcome it.

Superforecasting

Bayes' rule isn't just a probability theorem. Learn to calibrate your confidence and make more accurate predictions.

Statistical street fighting

Practice information hygiene and train your BS-detector using basic arithmetic.

###### Activities

There are two rest days that are filled with staff- and student-run activities and outings. Activities range from social to technical, and each student has the autonomy to choose their own schedule.

Board games

Students play abstract strategy games or larger social deduction games during free time.

Improv

Many people want to learn how to be funny, but taking improv will teach you that you already are.

Fermithon

Practice your estimation skills by competing in a Fermithon.

Negotiation workshop

Contrary to popular expectation, good negotiations are about cooperation. Learn strategies and tactics for leaving everyone happy.
