* Summer High School Research Program

## Spend your summer doing research at LLE!

Are you a Rochester, New York-area high school junior with a passion for science and a desire to explore the frontiers of research? Join us at LLE in July and August to experience the thrill of scientific discovery firsthand!

### About the Program

The eight-week paid program provides an exceptional opportunity for highly motivated students to experience scientific research in a realistic environment.

Students who are accepted into the program are assigned to a research project and supervised by a staff scientist or engineer at LLE. These projects form an integral part of the research program of the Laboratory and are related to the Laboratory’s 60-beam OMEGA laser, one of the world’s most powerful fusion lasers, and the OMEGA EP laser. At the end of the program, the students present the results of their projects at a symposium in the Laboratory.

### What to Expect

* **Hands-On Research:** Work alongside world-class scientists and engineers on exciting projects in fields like laser physics, plasma physics, and materials science.
* **Mentorship:** Benefit from personalized guidance and support from experienced researchers.
* **State-of-the-Art Facilities:** Explore our world-class laser systems, laboratories, computer systems, and equipment.
* **Networking Opportunities:** Connect with talented undergraduate and graduate students.
* **Another Way to Differentiate Yourself:**Stand out among your peers for college admissions, scholarships, and internships.

### **How to Apply**

Applications open in January 2026 for the July-August 2026 program. Selections are announced in April or May.

You can submit your application either online or on paper. Before using the “Apply Now” button, please save the following documents as PDFs for upload:

* A brief letter explaining your why you are interested in participating in the high school program
* An essay describing your interest in science and technology, and your future goals (This essay does not typically exceed two pages)

Additionally, you’ll need to submit:

* + A letter of recommendation on high school letterhead from a science or math teacher
  + Your high school transcript (grades 9-present)
  + Your most recent report card

Program application information will be available in January 2026.

> I was looking at summer research opportunities and this one checked all the boxes. It was a paid internship with a chance to do research with distinguished scientists. It was perfect. And the building is massive and super cool.
