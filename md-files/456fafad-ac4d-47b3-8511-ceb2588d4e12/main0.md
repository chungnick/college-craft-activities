# National High School Game Academy

### Learn how to work with others to create original games using advanced technology.

## Program Overview

The National High School Game Academy (NHSGA) facilitates focused, passionate, and dedicated high school students to experience six weeks of video game development using current gaming industry best practices. Sharing methods and paradigms used in Carnegie Mellon's [Masters of Entertainment Technology](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/learn/curriculum/)(M.E.T.) graduate program, the NHSGA teaches an innovative blend of hands-on team projects combined with in-depth traditional classwork, lecture, and discussion to “level up” a student’s skills and design thinking. The program culminates with each team creating an original game prototype which often serves as a portfolio-quality piece for the student’s college application. Every student accepted to the program can expect to contribute to every area of game development while maintaining their faculty-defined role on a multidisciplinary team.

The summer begins with two weeks of intense class study. As a verification of competence, individual and team homework is assigned and evaluated as the student progresses through the curriculum. Students must demonstrate a viable set of skills and methodologies in order to advance to the team game-building phase of the program. It is essential that each team member is willing and able to fully contribute to the game-building process. 

With a curriculum designed to elevate a student’s rigor, working process, and discipline, the NHSGA prepares students for their transition to college. Students are encouraged to expand their own creative possibilities in a unique blend of collaborative college-level work. 

## Program Expectations

**Public Speaking and Communication Skills**

Oral presentations and extensive teamwork/discussions are essential core components of this program. Students must be able and willing to fully engage in such activities with\* or without accommodations. Students who cannot demonstrate the ability to meet this requirement may be asked to leave the program.

\*Note: Accommodations are required to be approved by the [Office of Disability Resources](https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/).  
   
**Attendance** 

Students are expected to remain fully engaged throughout the six-week program, producing the quantity and quality of work required for meaningful team collaboration, attending in person every day, and arriving on time. If the student misses a critical number of days, regardless of the cause, or fails to complete the requisite quantity or quality of homework, this can result in removal from the program without a refund.

In the same vein, the NHSGA does not allow students to leave for other competitions or events, nor leave before the program is finished or arrive after it has begun.

**Student Behavior and Social Media**

We live in a world where online communication often allows for anonymity - participants can hide behind nicknames or screen names. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to disrespectful or inappropriate behavior.

The NSHGA enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy regarding student conduct in all forms of communication. Any student found to be disrespectful or inappropriate toward another Pre-College student - regardless of the platform or timing - will be immediately dismissed from the program without a refund.

## Curriculum

Carnegie Mellon University’s teaching philosophy is that all students learn by doing. The NHSGA enthusiastically embraces that philosophy, and every student will be taught the skills needed to develop video games.

In the weeks leading up to their arrival, students are emailed questionnaires by the faculty to test their game development knowledge and ascertain their skill level. The answers they provide allow us to place the students in tracks the faculty deems appropriate. 

### Weeks 1-2

## Curriculum Overview

Courses taught in week 1 include classes in the following disciplines: 2D and 3D art, software development, music composition, audio effects, game design, game narrative, team management and production, and public speaking. Every student is evaluated and either remains on their current track or is switched to a track which better suits their skillset before week 2. 

One week is little time to get a sense of every student, so delivery of homework in the first week is critical. Although homework assignments are not graded in a traditional sense (A, B, and so forth), their submission is required, and the faculty give feedback. Failure to submit homework can result in removal from the program without a refund.

In week 2, students hone their skills in the role or roles to which the faculty believes they will be assigned in the group projects. These roles are ultimately assigned by the faculty based on the students’ demonstrated skill levels in their classwork.

## Lectures and Workshops – Skill Building

In the first two weeks of the program, class instruction consists of daily lectures and workshops centered on crucial skills needed to build a video game.  
   
 Topics include:

* programming in Unity
* 2D art
* 3D art
* project management
* interactive storytelling
* game design
* animation
* sound design/music composition
* public speaking

*Please note: All topics receive equal weight in week one. In week two, specialization may occur based on the student's demonstrated skill level.*

## Assignments – Putting New Skills into Practice

During the first two weeks, students have assigned homework every night from every class attended that day. We average approximately 20 total homework assignments over the first two weeks. This works out to between three and four hours of homework every night. The NHSGA instructors evaluate the homework to assess student competence and to inform team project assignments. A typical day includes seven hours of classes and three hours of homework. Homework submission and regular, in-person attendance is required for continued participation in the program.

## Testimonials

I am a parent of three and my son who attended NHSGA is my youngest child. The program was incredibly impressive. The NHSGA program allowed the [students] to think independently and creatively, fostering their ability to be self driven, to work hard, and gain confidence in their achievements... Can't say enough wonderful things about this program and my son's best summer yet!! Thank you NHSGA!!! ~ B. Levine (Parent), NHSGA 2024

My experience at CMU was transformative. I learned so much, not only about game design, but also about how to work as a team to meet tight deadlines, overcome challenges, and balance various aspects of college life. I highly recommend this program to high schoolers who are focused on their academic development! ~ Jay P., NHSGA 2025

Please read the [Eligibility and Application Requirements](#eligibility) for complete eligibility details.

### Weeks 3-6

## Curriculum Overview

Students are divided into teams. **No student is guaranteed any specific role on any team. These assignments are based on demonstrated skill and aptitude for collaboration.** Roles are assigned with the goal of creating the best possible teams for the current project. One student on each team is chosen to be the team’s producer (a.k.a. project manager) in addition to their assigned production role. All other students contribute in their roles as assigned by faculty. Each team consists of six students: two programmers, two visual artists, one generalist (functioning as either an artist or programmer), and one composer/audio designer. By the end of the program, the student will have been assigned to two different teams and will have participated in building two different games.

All students receive in-depth instruction in all areas during the first two weeks. During that time, students attend a mix of classes. These classes teach best practices and core skills needed in game development. 

This program is a rigorous and demanding six-week experience. Full participation from the first day of orientation (the Sunday before the start of class) through the final presentations (on Friday of the last day of class) is mandatory. **Students must not commit to activities outside the program (examples include music lessons, team practices, recitals, online classes requiring additional homework). The NHSGA demands a student's full-time commitment while enrolled.**

## Collaborative Project #1 – First Round

Student teams work on a one-week “Lightning Round” project to better understand how games are created. Role assignments are thoughtfully made by faculty based on student assessments.

## Collaborative Project #2 – Second Round

After the first collaborative project, new teams build an original video game. In this project, teams are carefully selected by faculty to maximize each student’s potential for success based on performance observations.  
   
 This project begins with a pitch process where the team presents three ideas to faculty, with one selection chosen for the final project. The team builds their video game from scratch using the expertise acquired in their classwork and through daily hands-on mentoring by faculty.

## Presentations

After both rounds, each team member collaborates on a public presentation of the teams’ work for that round. Students are taught skills in this area, but must be willing and able to fully participate in such presentations.

## Teams - Read Carefully!

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY - IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING TEAMS, TEAMWORK, AND TEAM ASSIGNMENTS:**

* Teams consist of two (2) programmers, two (2) artists, one (1) generalist, and one (1) sound designer/music composer.
* Team roles are assigned by faculty based on competence displayed in class, interviews with faculty, and (for the second project) teamwork as demonstrated during the Lightning Round**.**
* Students are expected to perform the responsibilities of their assigned role with the understanding that team workloads assume equal contribution from each team member.
* Work may not be done remotely. In-person, on-time attendance is mandatory for all program activities.
* When an applicant applies to the program, they should carefully consider what team role they wish to hold and assemble their application accordingly. Applicants may apply to the NHSGA as:
  + a programmer (Software Development track)
  + artist (Visual Arts/Graphic Design track)
  + sound designer (Sound Design/Music Composition track)
  + generalist (Game Generalist track)

Each category implies what team role the applicant seeks to fill. Generalists are those who believe their overall skillset would benefit their NHSGA teams but are not yet certain which role fits them best. Many students find success letting us guide their development in this way.

* If the applicant chooses a specific role when they apply, they will be evaluated against those other applicants who have applied for that role.
* **No team role is guaranteed** as faculty prioritizes balanced, capable teams. For example, if a student applied as a programmer yet displays a talent for sound design, they may be assigned to a project as the sound designer.

## Assignments – Workload

After the game project work begins, we historically find teams often work at least eight hours every day driven by their own enthusiasm to complete their project, including weekends. Teams strive to produce quality work that can be submitted with their college applications with confidence and pride.

## Presentation and College Prep – Game Time

At the end of both the first and second projects, student teams present their games to an audience of faculty, students, and guests with feedback provided.

Games will be all-original ideas, playable on hardware assigned by faculty, and designed to become a portfolio piece which students can use in the college admission process.

Please be aware that if Pre-College NHSGA reaches its enrollment capacity prior to the final application deadline, we will no longer accept application submissions. We will email any in-progress NHSGA applicants as well as post the announcement in the application and on the website.

## Application Requirements

The application for the NHSGA program will consist of the following:

* Completed online application
* Unofficial transcript
* Standardized test scores (optional)
* One letter of recommendation
* Responses to essay prompts
* Examples of applicant work relevant to their specific track(s) of interest (i.e., Software Development, Visual Arts/Graphic Design, Sound Design or Music Composition, Game Generalist)

**Submission of applicant work:**

**Do not submit a link to an online portfolio.**Links expire, break, and websites can be difficult/time-consuming to navigate. Instead, **directly upload a document or documents.**

It is greatly preferred that all documents and work examples should be compiled into a single PDF document. If this is problematic, a series of documents is acceptable. Especially valuable would be a video of any completed interactive work being played. Always make clear what role the student performed on any specific collaborative project.

No more than 10 documents or work examples should be submitted. Examples of written code are allowed, so long as the applicant explains context for what skills the code sample is designed to demonstrate. If applying for a software position, please submit a video of the game or project being played or used live.

If an applicant is choosing the NHSGA for both a first and second choice program with different tracks per choice, work relevant to both tracks should be submitted. It is preferred that each choice is supported by relevant work examples submitted in separate documents labeled for the appropriate track. Make it clear to the review committee which samples should be considered for which role.

All submitted documents and examples are to be labeled to include the following:

* Title
* Medium (if artwork)
* Description (to explain the context)
* Something the applicant learned from creating the piece

## Applying to Tracks: What You Need to Know!

**Please carefully read the details below prior to application submission:**

**Software Development**

NHSGA games are built using Unity. While classes in computer science or programming are useful, demonstrating hands-on Unity experience is considered advantageous in the application review process. **It is not, however, a requirement**.

Always make clear what role the applicant performed on any specific collaborative project submitted in this fashion.

**For each game project, please submit the following:**

* A brief 3-4 sentence description of the technical aspects of your project: what engine was this made in, what libraries did you use, and how did you contribute to the overall project? If you used any premade assets in a significant way to make this project, please note that as well.
* At least 30 seconds of video demo showcasing your game.
* Samples of code that you’ve written for this project. We’d especially like to see any code involving character movement or enemy AI, but you’re free to submit whatever you think highlights your ability best.

**For non-game project submissions:**

For any non-video game portfolio submissions, please include **at least** the following:

* Samples of code that you’ve written for this project.
* A detailed description of the project, including all relevant technical details as well as how you contributed to the project.

If an applicant applies on the Software Development track, it will be understood that they wish to be assigned to a team in the role of programmer.

**Visual Arts/Graphic Design (2D/3D Art)**

Applicants should submit images that demonstrate a foundation in traditional arts. Suggestions include but are not limited to charcoal studies of surface interaction with light, anatomy, perspective, and attention to detail. Pieces may include, but are not limited to, self-portraiture, portraiture, still-life, architecture, animals and pets, or landscapes.

Applicants may include 3D work, but it is not required. Submitted 3D digital modeling work should include a wireframe view.

If submitting images from a group project, please specify the exact nature of your contributions.

Applicants are encouraged to submit images beyond the specific suggestions above. The above suggestions are not required, and all additional work will be seriously considered.

No more than 6-10 images should be submitted.

Include a short paragraph summarizing what you hope to gain from participating in the program.

If an applicant applies on the Visual Arts/Graphic Design track, it will be understood that they wish to be assigned to a team in the role of artist. They will be given basic instruction in software development in Unity, but only enough to facilitate collaboration with their teammates. 

**Sound Design or Music Composition**

Applicant submissions can include any of the following: Song recordings, original sheet music, recordings of game or film projects, sound design work, and/or screenshots of projects within a DAW (plugin chains, mixers, VSTs, and so on).

Files should be uploaded in MP4 or WAV format.

For video submissions, the length should be approximately 30 seconds. Accompanying each submission should be a brief description of the design process: Inspirations, goals, tools, and method of creation or implementation.  
   
 For instance, tell us what DAW you used to make a music track and what effects and VSTs (or recording methods) you used. Or, for a recording of a game, describe your particular contribution to the game, and describe the process of creating and implementing a particular sound effect.

If an applicant applies on the Sound Design or Music Composition track, it will be understood that they wish to be assigned to a team in the role of sound designer/music composer. Music Composition and creation of Sound FX is equally important in the creation of games. Sound Designers will be given basic instruction in software development in Unity, but only enough to facilitate collaboration with their teammates. 

**Game Generalist**

Applicants should submit examples of any work that demonstrates a passion in any creative field and following any relevant submission guidelines noted above (ex. game design, interactive story, website design, 2D or 3D artwork, photography, filmmaking, samples of fiction or screenplays, tabletop game design, RPG campaigns, music performance, etc.). Game Generalists will be given basic instruction in software development in Unity, but only enough to facilitate collaboration with their teammates. Game Generalists should not apply expecting to land a software engineering role on a team. **We have noticed a trend of late where a student seemingly tries to use “Generalist” when they are feeling less confident about their abilities in art or programming. If either of those two areas are where your strength lies, apply in those areas. Don’t use Generalist.**

If an applicant applies on the Game Generalist track, it will be understood that **they are willing to perform any role assigned to them**. Applicants looking for a more general learning experience from the NHSGA should apply as a Game Generalist.

## Application Essay Prompts

Two essays responding to the following prompts\* are required:

* What do you hope to gain from participating in Carnegie Mellon’s Pre-College Programs? (300-500 words maximum)
* Tell us about your favorite game. Why do you find it fun? Be specific about the aspects that make it fun for you. Lastly, what emotion did you feel while playing the game? Why do think this occurred? (300 words maximum)

*\*Additional essay prompts may be added.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this a programming camp?**

This is not solely a programming curriculum. If students have those expectations, they will be disappointed. It is multidisciplinary.

**Will I earn college credit from this program?**

No, NHSGA students do not earn college credit.

**Do I have to attend the entire six weeks of classes?**

Yes. Students will be working with a team in NHSGA, with each team member having a defined team role. It is critical that all team members remain engaged until the end of the six weeks. Each teams’ efforts will culminate with a final presentation on the last day of the program. In-person, on-time attendance every day is a requirement. The failure to fulfill this requirement can result in removal from the program without a refund.

**Should I bring my own computer?**

Yes, each student must have access to a personal laptop computer for use during class time to complete game development coursework. Homework is often done at night and sometimes on weekends, so this laptop computer should be available for a student’s use during these times. The minimum system requirements will be provided to admitted students during the enrollment process. Students will download a copy of all game development tools and software required for the various classes onto their laptop.

**Is there a commuter option?**

No, NHSGA is offered as a residential program only due to the team collaboration required by the homework assignments. Students can expect to work with their teams on evenings and weekends. Team Producers continue to report that these in-person, face-to-face meeting times on the weekend prove crucial to any team’s success.
