## The benefits of living in metro Phoenix

Metro Phoenix, home to ASU’s four main campuses, is one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. and is full of big opportunities. As an ASU student, you’ll have access to internships and industry partners so you can start getting practical experience in your field of study while you’re still a student. These are opportunities you just can’t find in smaller cities. And depending which campus you’re on, you’re as little as 10 to 30 minutes away from Sky Harbor International Airport — a launchpad to the entire world.

### Cost and financial aid

Arizona State University offers one of the lowest tuition rates in the Big 12, and with scholarships and financial aid factored in, the cost becomes more affordable. Nonresident students are also automatically considered for ASU’s New American University Scholarship upon admission to the university.
