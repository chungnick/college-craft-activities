Your college tuition likely won’t be the same as what your fellow Sun Devils pay. Many factors play a part in determining what your final bill looks like such as your major, your campus, how many credits you take and your residency status.

The ASU tuition calculator is an easy-to-use tool (seriously, it takes like 30 seconds) that shows you what you can expect to pay. Simply input a few pieces of information into the tuition calculator and see the costs.

Simply input a few pieces of information into the tuition calculator and choose “Calculate” to see the estimated cost breakdown.

**Note: A new graduate program or a graduate program that does not currently assess a program fee may request the establishment of a program fee. Any such fee would be considered by the Arizona Board of Regents in April 2025. The estimator will be updated by April 30, 2025, with any fees approved by the board.**

**Disclaimers**

This is not a bill. This is only an estimate. All amounts shown here or in other university publications or Web pages represent tuition and fees as currently approved. However, Arizona State University reserves the right to increase or modify tuition and fees without prior notice, upon approval by the Arizona Board of Regents or as otherwise consistent with Board policy, and to make such modifications applicable to students enrolled at ASU at that time as well as to incoming students. In addition, all tuition amounts and fees are subject to change at any time for correction of errors. Finally, please note, that fee amounts billed for any period may be adjusted at a future date.

† Some graduate and online campus programs charge differential or program specific tuition, which is in addition to the base tuition charged each semester a student enrolls. These fees will either be listed as a separate line item labeled Program Tuition, or will be automatically included in the base tuition rate. The Professional Flight, and Draper programs will continue to maintain a separate class fee. General tuition rates are available if you select “None/Not Listed” from the drop-down menu labeled Academic Programs with Differential or Program Tuition.

### Net Price Calculator

If you’re an incoming first-year domestic student, you can use the Net Price Calculator to get an **estimate** of how much financial aid you **might** be eligible for. This will help you get an idea of what your out-of-pocket costs will be.
