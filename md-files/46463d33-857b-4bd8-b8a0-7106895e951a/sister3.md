## What is tuition?

Tuition is what you pay to attend classes and earn your degree. When you hear someone say, “Tuition is $12,000 dollars,” that usually means it is $12,000 for the entire year (i.e., fall and spring semester — summer sessions tuition is usually additional). Along with tuition costs, students usually have to pay other fees. These can include athletic, lab and technology fees. Your tuition does not include certain things like your books, campus housing and food. Find a personalized tuition estimate based on your information, degree choices and residency by using the tuition estimator.

## How much is ASU tuition?

Everyone's tuition differs depending on a number of factors such as what you study, how much financial aid you get, whether you live on campus and more.

Most students at ASU take advantage of financial aid. Using the tuition estimator tool, select the category that fits you best to find an estimate of how much tuition will cost for you at ASU without financial aid and before other cost reductions.
