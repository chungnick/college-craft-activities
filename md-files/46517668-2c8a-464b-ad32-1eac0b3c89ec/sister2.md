# NextGen High School Internship Program

## Overview

***After a downshift for 2025, we are planning to re-start Next Gen in the summer of 2026. The application process is open at the link [here](https://emory.infoready4.com/#freeformCompetitionDetail/2002141).***

The Department of Human Genetics at Emory University recognizes that our differences make us stronger. To deliver the highest quality of care, we need a team with a wide variety of experiential backgrounds. That's why we're actively recruiting learners, faculty members and staff from all backgrounds, to help us improve health outcomes for all members of the community we serve.

In 2022, we established the Next Gen High School Internship Program to increase enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) among students. This is a paid summer internship program for high school students of all backgrounds. Students applying should have a demonstrated interest in advancing the reach of STEM education.

As not all students will have been exposed to the same STEM background based on the schools they are attending, there will be multiple facets to the internship program to ensure that all students are able to achieve the learning objectives of the internship program. Students will attend lectures for general information, but they will also be able to rotate through a variety of labs and clinical experiences, allowing them to have hands-on experience in both the lab and clinical setting. We will also take advantage of the variety of programs and businesses proximal to Emory University. We believe that the rich culture of the Atlanta area will be an asset in our efforts to expose high school students to the myriad of opportunities that are available to them. We will also continue to have activities and programs throughout the school year for students to participate in.

In this video essay, Randolph Douge describes his rich and varied summer experience as a 2023 NextGen Intern.

In this 1980's style video, Emily Nguyen captures the variety of experiences interns have.
