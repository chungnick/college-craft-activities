    * **Other considerations:** Your or your parents’ citizenship status *does not* affect eligibility.

**How do I apply to a STEM class?**
:   * To apply, you must complete an application, submit a high school transcript, engineer or sketch a prototype (more explained in the application) and write about it, and a letter of recommendation.  Go tostart an application.

**Do I need to choose two classes?**
:   * Yes, for the all 6-week **Summer STEM** classes; however,  if you intend to apply to a 3-week Session I and you  you should choose a first and second choice course. This increases your chances of being accepted into one of them.

**Do I need a recommendation letter?**
:   Yes, at least one recommendation letter is required for all STEM programs.

    * If there’s a gap in your transcript or you need help eplaining a lower grade, you should ask a recommender who can provide that context.
    * Be sure to ask your recommender early, so they have adequate time to   
      compose a comprehensive letter.
    * If you want pointers on how to secure a strong letter of recommendation (your letter receives a score in your application), click [here](https://youtu.be/rABuIUIwk1U) for some tips on securing a stellar letter.

**When do I find out if I am accepted to a STEM program?**
:   * **Summer STEM:** Decisions are emailed during the last week of April, including your class assignment, financial aid award, and requests for pertinent information, such as your headshot, and signed attendance and code of conduct agreements.
    * **STEM Saturdays:** Acceptance emails go out at least 10 days before the course begins, including your class assignment, financial aid award, and requests for pertinent information, such as your headshot, and signed attendance and code of conduct agreements.

**What if I want to change classes?**
:   * After you accept your class assignment, **class changes are not permitted**, due to limited space. Be sure to review the course descriptions and ensure they are aligned to your interests, so that you make the right choice for YOU.

    * Before you accept, you may request a change; however, your being granted a seat depends on availability.

**Is there housing for the STEM programs?**
:   * No, The Cooper Union does not provide housing for its **STEM Summer** or **STEM Saturdays** programs.

**How many students per class?**
:   * Each class typically has an average enrollment of 20–25 students, allowing for close mentorship and meaningful collaboration. There will also be teaching assistants in your class to also support you!

**Is there a final presentation? Are families invited?**
:   * Yes, on the final day of the program (1:00 pm–4:00 pm), students present their projects publicly. Families and friends are always welcome to attend.
