**Arduino & ESP32 Innovation Lab: From Circuits to Smart Devices: Turn Your Ideas into Real-World Prototypes**
:   Starting with **rapid prototyping on the Arduino Uno** and gradually advancing to connected systems on the ESP32 (Espressif Systems 32-bit microcontroller), you explore the full spectrum of modern embedded innovation. The course begins with **hands-on immersion into microcontroller fundamentals**, teaching you how hardware responds to digital inputs and outputs, pulse-width modulation, analog sensing, and simple actuators. **You will experiment with "vibe coding,**" an intuitive, exploratory approach that accelerates creative problem-solving and allows ideas to be prototyped quickly.

    As confidence in Arduino-based systems grows, the class transitions to applied engineering with the ESP32, introducing wireless capabilities such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for real-world Internet of Things (IoT) designs. You interact with displays, environmental sensors, and smart actuators to create devices that collect data, communicate information, or respond intelligently to their environment.

    **Alongside electronics and programming, you will learn to design functional 3D housings in a computer-aided design (CAD) tool and prepare parts for 3D printing**, enabling them to package electronics into polished, testable prototypes. Throughout the course, you practice engineering design thinking: identifying problems, brainstorming solutions, iterating ideas, and clearly communicating the process.

    By the final week, student pairs propose and implement an original hardware-software system, culminating in a showcase where teams present their prototype, explain their design process, and demonstrate real-world impact.

    **\*\*\*Prerequisites:** Prior programming experience in any language is recommended so that class time can focus on microcontroller implementation, debugging, and project development rather than introductory coding fundamentals. Experience developing code solely using artificial intelligence (AI) tools, block-based coding platforms, or code generators does not count as prior programming experience. If you have only used these latter tools, you are advised not to enroll in this course.

    **By the end of this course, you will:**

    * Develop familiarity with embedded systems tools, sensors, actuators, and microcontroller workflows.
    * **Apply intermediate programming techniques using C++ within the Arduino and ESP32A** (Espressif Systems 32-bit microcontroller) frameworks.
    * Interface hardware devices correctly, interpret sensor data, and use debugging strategies to troubleshoot software and electronics.
    * **Use a computer-aided design (CAD) tool to model, refine, and prepare 3D housings that support functional robotics designs.**
    * **Apply engineering design thinking** to identify problems, brainstorm solutions, and build iterative prototypes.
    * Communicate technical ideas effectively through presentations, diagrams, demonstrations, and code walkthroughs in clear, jargon-free language.
    * **Design and implement an original hardware-software prototype** demonstrating creativity, technical skill, and sound engineering reasoning.
