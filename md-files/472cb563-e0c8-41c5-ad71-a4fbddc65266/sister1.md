# High School Summer Program

#### Presenting the 66th Annual

### Carl B. & Florence E. King Foundation High School Summer Program in Biomedical Sciences

### sponsored by the [School of Health Professions](https://www.mdanderson.org/shp)

*Program is open ONLY to **current**Texas high school seniors age **18 + by program start**.*

### June 1 - August 7, 2026

The program introduces interested and qualified young Texans **interested in an Allied Health career** to a research environment and provides firsthand experiences in the varied career opportunities available at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, the nation's leading cancer research and treatment centers. Up to 6 students will be selected to participate in this 10-week program.

Students selected for the program are given a rare opportunity to participate in a research project in one of the biomedical disciplines under the guidance of a full-time member of the MD Anderson faculty. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the basic principles that form the foundation for scientific investigation.

During the program, students work in MD Anderson laboratories five days a week, from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. The majority of this time is spent doing actual hands-on work that provides the students with a clear knowledge of exactly what it means to be a biomedical researcher as well as an understanding of the discipline required.

The laboratory experience is supplemented by seminars presented by faculty on a wide variety of research topics and by activities exclusive to participants of all the Summer Programs, which may include an abstract, poster, and elevator speech competitions. At the conclusion of the program, participants will share their experiences during a presentation and a celebration luncheon.

Participants will approach their upcoming college term with an increased awareness and confidence in allied health professions career fields.

*\*\*\* Applicants must be 18 years of age or older by the time they start the program and must be available for the entire 10 weeks. However, we understand some school districts finish school and host commencement during the first week of the program. In this case, an invitee may start the second week and participate the remaining nine weeks. \*\*\**
