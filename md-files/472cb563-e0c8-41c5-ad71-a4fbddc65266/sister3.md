# Application and Forms for Undergraduate Programs

The School of Health Professions offers undergraduate programs leading to a Bachelor of Science degree, graduate programs leading to a Master of Science degree and certificate programs leading to an Advanced Technical Certificate.

Students enter the program in August each year unless otherwise noted. Applicants will be selected through a competitive and holistic admission process. Our holistic review process includes consideration of the following factors.

* GPA
* Number of prerequisite courses at the time of application
* Essay
* Professional recommendation forms

Select programs also take into consideration a clinical observation and interview. A minimum overall GPA and science GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale is required for admission consideration. Meeting the minimum criteria does not guarantee acceptance.

The [Office of the Registrar](https://www.uth.edu/registrar/) at UTHealth Houston also serves as the registrar for the MD Anderson School of Health Professions. Although documents related to the admissions process should be sent to UTHealth Houston, students are enrolled at and will graduate from the  School of Health Professions.

## 1. Priority Deadlines

Applicants should submit the application and all supporting documents by the priority application deadline. Applications and documents received after the priority dates will be considered for admission only if space is available.

**To ensure all documents are matched properly, make sure to submit your admissions application before submitting your college transcripts and professional recommendation forms.**

## Fall 2026 Admissions

Applications open Sept. 15, 2025.  
**Priority deadline** to submit an admissions application and all supporting documents are specific to each program.

## 3. Complete Online Application and an Essay

Apply online to the school. Access the online application form by visiting the [Office of the Registrar](https://apply.uth.tmc.edu/psp/applyuth/APPLYUTH/ENTP/h/?tab=UT_EP_NVT_APPLYUTH). Make sure to complete the essay question posted on the online application. Pay a non-refundable **$65** application fee upon submission of your application.

## 4. Submit Three Recommendations

Submit recommendation forms from three professional references. SHP does not accept letters of recommendation.

Choose three professional references who can evaluate your academic abilities and suitability for a healthcare program. Appropriate references include a college professor, supervisor, counselor, academic advisor, volunteer coordinator, or similar.

After submitting your admissions application, log into your application portal via applyUTH. Navigate to eForms, then click on the Recommendation Form button. You’ll need to complete this Recommendation Form three times, once for each reference, by entering their name and email address.

Each reference will receive an email with instructions to submit an electronic recommendation form on your behalf. They will have 14 days to complete it. You’ll be notified by email once each form is submitted.

If a reference does not complete the form within 14 days, you will have the option to select a new reference.

## 5. Submit Official College Transcript(s) from Each School Attended

The transcript(s) should show a record of all academic work completed and be sent directly from the corresponding college to the [Office of the Registrar](http://www.uth.edu/registrar/applicants/). To ensure prompt processing, request that your school sends transcripts using “SPEEDE”.  If your school cannot send “SPEEDE” transcripts, colleges may send transcripts in the mail or electronically.

If an email address is required for the submission of the official transcript, please utilize [student-admissions@uth.tmc.edu](mailto:student-admissions@uth.tmc.edu).

Submitted transcripts are considered "official" if the print date is within the previous six months. Visit the Office of the Registrar [Academic Transcripts](https://www.uth.edu/registrar/applicants/academictranscripts) page for more information.

## 6. Submit Foreign College Transcripts

All applicants with foreign college transcripts/mark sheets must have a course by course, and grade by grade evaluation by an [approved evaluation agency](/content/dam/mdanderson/documents/education-training/school-of-health-professions/documents/Acceptable%20Evaluation%20Agencies.pdf) (PDF).

## 7. Attend Information Session

All applicants to the **Diagnostic Imaging**, **Diagnostic Medical Sonography, or Radiation Therapy**program are required to attend an [information session](/education-training/degree-granting-schools/school-of-health-professions/prospective-students/program-sessions.html).

## 8. Submit TOEFL Scores

For all international students whose native language is not English, proof of English language proficiency must be submitted. The School of Health Professions accepts the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) as a standardized test to measure the English language ability of non-native speakers. A minimum TOEFL score of 80 on the internet-based format or 550 on the paper exam is required.

The TOEFL Designated Institution Code for MD Anderson is **6906**.

Applicants meeting any criteria below are exempt from the TOEFL:

* If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, regardless of your native language.
* If you have earned a high school diploma from an accredited U.S. high school.
* If you have earned an Associate of Arts, Associate of Science,  Bachelor's degree or higher level degree from an accredited U.S. college or university.
* If you have obtained a secondary school degree or higher level degree from a country where English is spoken as the native language.
* If you have completed English Composition I (ENGL 1301) and II (ENGL 1302) with a grade of C or better.

## 9. Complete Clinical Site Visit

This is only required for applicants to the following programs:

* **Diagnostic Imaging**: Only competitive applicants will be invited to complete an 8-hour clinical site visit.
* **Radiation Therapy:** All applicants are required to schedule a 16-hour clinical site visit. Email the [Radiation Therapy Program](mailto:djwhiteing@mdanderson.edu?Subject=Applicant%20Clinical%20Site%20Visit%20Scheduling) for scheduling.

## 10. Submit all Required Documents

The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston  
P.O. Box 20036  
Houston, TX 77225-0036

## 11. Admissions Interview

The Admissions Review Committee will review all applicants that submit a complete application, including required documents, by the respective program priority deadline. Upon review, competitive applicants will be invited for an admissions interview. Applications and documents received after the priority dates will be considered by the Admissions Review Committee only if space is available.

Competitive applicants in **Medical Dosimetry** will be invited for a [math assessment](/content/dam/mdanderson/documents/education-training/school-of-health-professions/documents/bsmdos_math_assessment_outline.pdf) in addition to the admissions interview.
