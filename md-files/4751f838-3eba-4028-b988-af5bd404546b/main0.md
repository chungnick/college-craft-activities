## PennRSSA-Fall Program

This fall, students are engaging in a blend of virtual learning and in-person experiences designed to build foundational investment knowledge and apply it to real-world challenges.

If you missed the chance to apply this time, don’t worry. Keep an eye out for the upcoming Spring program! Applications will open soon, so stay tuned for your opportunity to join us.

## About PennRSSA

The Penn Rising Scholar Success Academy (PennRSSA) is a free, college preparatory and career exploration program designed for high school students across Philadelphia. Students enrolled in School District of Philadelphia, public charter, and Archdiocese of Philadelphia high schools are eligible to participate in either of our two programs regardless of their academic record.

## Program Mission

PennRSSA launched in July 2020 as the Rising Senior Summer Academy, a direct intervention to address pandemic-related disruptions to education in our city. Today, our goal remains the same—to advance the futures of Philadelphia students by:

* Increasing student access to high-quality learning experiences through engaging, radical pedagogy;
* Creating a supportive program environment which balances high expectations and academic rigor with trauma-informed practices for participant achievement;
* Providing engaged mentorship from undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, staff, and faculty in tailored 1:1 and interactive “pod” settings;
* Equipping students for postsecondary success by expanding their skills, knowledge, confidence, motivation, and preparedness to navigate the postsecondary application and enrollment processes.

To date, more than 6,000 Philadelphia high school students have participated in PennRSSA.
