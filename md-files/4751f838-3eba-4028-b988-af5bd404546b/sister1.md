## Apply to PennRSSA

The Penn Rising Scholar Success Academy (PennRSSA) is a free, hybrid, college preparatory and career exploration program designed for rising high school seniors across Philadelphia. Rising seniors enrolled in School District of Philadelphia, public charter, and Archdiocese of Philadelphia high schools are eligible to participate, regardless of their academic record.

[Interest Survey](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8J7oY2ZmXxt7A2O) for Fall 2025 will close on August. 18th.

##

### Eligibility

PennRSSA programs are open to any student in a **School District of Philadelphia**, **Archdiocese of Philadelphia**, or **Philadelphia public charter school**.

Our programs welcome students of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. There are **no academic prerequisites** (e.g., GPA, test score).

Summer Academy students will participate the summer between their junior and senior year.

### Spring Term

This spring, students are taking part in two exciting 5-week career exploration courses hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. These courses are designed to introduce students to a variety of careers and fields connected to Penn’s undergraduate and graduate schools. Guided by Penn students and professionals, students’ll participate in both virtual and hands-on, in-person sessions that bring career exploration to life.

Here’s what to expect:

* **Career Pods:** Students will be grouped into pods of about 12-15 students based on your career interests.
* **Two Career Pathways:** Over the term, students will have the chance to explore two career paths of their choice.
* **Weekly Virtual Sessions:** Once a week, students will join 60-90 minute virtual sessions (after school, between 6 PM and 8 PM) that dive into career options and academic pathways.
* **Interactive Opportunities:** Attend live Q&A sessions, webinars, and practical learning experiences. Students will meet professionals from the careers they are exploring!
