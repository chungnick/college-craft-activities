## PennRSSA Summer Academy

PennRSSA Summer Academy is an intensive, six-week, hybrid summer program that immerses all high school students in an academic, career, and postsecondary preparatory experience.

The program includes facilitated and independent content, including live instruction and four rigorous virtual courses.

Each student is assigned to a peer cohort (“Pod”) led by a current Penn graduate or professional student.

Additionally, students are provided an opportunity to complete a project-based Capstone/Service-Learning Project, designed to develop their 21st-century learning skills for future career success.

The 2025 PennRSSA Summer Academy concluded on July 29, 2025. Stay tuned for updates on our 2026 summer program!

For more information, email penn-rssa@upenn.edu.

## PennRSSA Open

PennRSSA Open is a self-paced, self-guided alternative to the PennRSSA Summer Academy.

Open consists of “Applying to College 101” and “Applied Economics and Finance,” two of the four anchored virtual Academy courses.

Designed in collaboration with our 12 graduate and professional schools, these courses provide expert guidance to students in grades 6-12 in financial awareness and career exploration.

For more information, email penn-rssa@upenn.edu.

## PennRSSA Academic Year

PennRSSA Academic Year is PennRSSA’s new, innovative, year-long program that immerses students in a dynamic, intersectional career exploration and preparation approach. In partnership with the School District of Philadelphia, the academic year program seeks to equip high school students across Philadelphia with knowledge of different career fields and the ability to embrace professional opportunities.

* Students can design their learning path by selecting three of our twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools to explore.
* Students work collaboratively with peers on a Capstone/Service Learning experience to positively impact today’s—and tomorrow’s—most complex problems in their neighborhoods, nation, and the world.
* Students build foundational investment knowledge while working on real-world challenges.

The PennRSSA Academic Year Fall Program will run from 9/15-12/8.

For more information, email penn-rssa@upenn.edu.
