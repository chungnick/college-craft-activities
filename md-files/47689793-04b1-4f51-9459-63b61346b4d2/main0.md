# SAGE

Science Accelerating Growth and Engagement (SAGE) is a **free, one-week summer day camp** designed for Northern California public high school students (ages 14–17) . The SAGE mission is to engage curious and passionate students and empower them to explore a wide range of possibilities for their future. The LLNL SAGE camp is ***tentatively*** **scheduled for June 8–12, 2026.**

Led by passionate scientists and engineers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, SAGE is a week filled with hands-on discovery, real STEM experiences, and connections with professionals who turn big ideas into world-changing innovations. Students will build community, spark new interests, and gain a glimpse into careers they may one day pursue.

In partnership with other Department of Energy national laboratories, SAGE works to broaden participation in STEM and inspire the next generation of innovators, problem-solvers, and scientific leaders.
