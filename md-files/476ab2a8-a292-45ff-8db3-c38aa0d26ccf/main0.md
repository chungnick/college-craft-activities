Taught by a distinguished member of the Rutgers law faculty, this program is designed for students who have an interest in the law and government, whether considering a career in the legal field or participating in mock trial competition, or those who wish to hone their public speaking and advocacy skills.

Over the course of the program, students will learn the basics of civil and criminal law, sources of law, and the creation of law through interactive lessons, courtroom visits, guest lectures, and mock trials. Students will also be exposed to the many diverse career opportunities available in the legal field.

Students can choose to participate in one-week or two-weeks of the program, as each week will tackle a different case.

* Week II: Criminal Case
