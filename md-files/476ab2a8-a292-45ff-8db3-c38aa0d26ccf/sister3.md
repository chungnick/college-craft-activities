## Admissions Decisions

Applications are reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis, meaning that we review applications as they are received, until each academy reached full capacity.

* ### Decision Information

  If an applicant's application is complete with all required supplemental documents and our team does not have any further questions, an applicant will be notified within two or three weeks after submission.

  **All students will receive an email with their admission decisions**, so be sure to check the email included on the application.

  If an applicant has had no communication from us for more than three weeks after submission, we ask applicants to check their spam or junk folder. We have found that occasionally happens with emails coming from our Pre-College Application portal. If there is nothing there, please email our team at [precollegeacademies@rutgers.edu](mailto:precollegeacademies@rutgers.edu) or call 848-932-7565 to speak with our Pre-College Manager, Maria Kuberiet, to ask for an update.
* ### Admitted Students

  If admitted to the program, students will receive an email that includes an acceptance letter and information on how to pay.

  Admission does not guarantee enrollment into the Summer Academies until a student's enrollment is confirmed with a $500 USD non-refundable deposit to reserve a spot in the academy.

  If either the deposit or full payment is not made by the appropriate due dates, you will lose your spot and be placed on the waiting list.
* ### Wait List

  The Rutgers Pre-College Summer Academies operates on a rolling admissions basis, meaning that our team reviews and accepts applications as they are received until each academy reaches capacity. Once an academy is fully, any additional qualified applicants are placed on a waitlist.

  Students who are waitlisted will be notified of their status by email. If a spot becomes available, we reach out to waitlisted students in the order they were added to the list
* ### Enrollment for Accepted Students

  Students who are accepted to the program will receive a link to the online payment portal in their acceptance letter and information.

  **Accepted students must confirm their attendance by submitting a $500 USD non-refundable deposit.** **Enrollment in the Summer Academies is not guaranteed until the deposit has been received.**

  The remaining balance must be paid by the final program payment due date. If either the deposit or full payment is not made by the appropriate due dates, you will lose your spot and be placed on the waiting list.

  Additional information will be sent to enrolled students approximately two weeks before the academy's start date. This will include a Welcome Packet with the details of what to bring, the residential accommodations for residential academies, check-in and check-out procedures, etc.
