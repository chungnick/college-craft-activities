# Pollinator Health and Ecology (Adler Lab)

Our competitive Research Intensives program places high-achieving high school students in professional working labs alongside distinguished faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.

**Research Intensive in the Pollinator Health and Ecology Lab (Adler Lab)**

The Adler lab studies how floral traits, including shape, size and rewards, affect pollinator health and pathogen transmission. More generally, we are also interested in how species interactions affect pollinator behavior and pollination.

Students in the Adler lab will use a combination of field and lab experimental manipulations to answer their questions. Students will conduct individual or small group experiments to understand how pollen, nectar or other floral traits affect pollinator behavior, health and disease transmission, or will work on comparing transmission dynamics between different bee species.

The Adler Lab can host up to 4 students. [Learn more](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/).

**Program Overview**

During this program, high school students will assist UMass faculty and graduate students in research labs while learning about research methodologies and contributing to ongoing research studies. Each student will create and present a research poster to faculty, fellow students, friends and family at a poster session at the end of the program.

Students will come away with an introduction to the field of Biology, firsthand experience with university-level research, and an understanding of opportunities that exist for undergraduate students at a major R1 university such as UMass Amherst.

**Applications**

For all Research Intensives applications: In your statement of interest, please include 3 lab choices from our [list of available labs](https://www.umass.edu/uww/programs/pre-college/research_intensives) along with a brief explanation of your interest in each one.

**Scholarships**

The Adler lab is dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment in ecological research. People from marginalized groups (including BIPOC, Hispanic, Latino/a, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders and first-generation college students) who cannot meet the financial obligations of the Pre-College program are encouraged to apply for a scholarship. Please see [Tuition & Fees](https://www.umass.edu/uww/programs/pre-college/fees) to learn how to apply.
