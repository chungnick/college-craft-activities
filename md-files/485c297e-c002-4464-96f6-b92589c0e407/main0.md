# Youth Engaged in Science

Youth Engaged in Science (YES) is a [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/)-funded program that encourages high school students to pursue a future in cancer research and care.

YES is a full-time, seven-week, paid summer program offering eligible students opportunities to participate in educational activities and cancer research projects in labs with outstanding [Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) scientists](/cancer/members/member-directory "Member Directory") based at Case Western Reserve University.

## Your Future in Cancer Research Starts Here!

Participants receive:

* A $2,500 stipend for full participation and successful project completion
* Foundational training in laboratory safety, research techniques, and cancer biology in the Week 1 "bootcamp"
* Full-time, hands-on cancer research lab experience (35 hours/week for seven weeks)
* Daily lunches that include instruction in science, college preparation, and career opportunities
* An end-of-summer celebration at which students present their results and have the chance to earn awards for best presentation in various categories
* Writing instruction for scientific communication and college applications
* College campus experience

### The YES Program's Scientific Enrichment Opportunity (SEO)
