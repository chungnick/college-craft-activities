# Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR)

[Applications are Open. Click Here.](https://cwru.infoready4.com/#freeformCompetitionDetail/1997100)

Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR) is a [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/)-funded program meant to generate excitement in highly motivated undergraduates to pursue a future in cancer research and prepare them for the next stage of their careers.

The CanSUR Program supports 32 undergraduates for a 10-week period from June through August to work in labs with [Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC)](https://case.edu/cancer/about-us) researchers at [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu) in Cleveland, Ohio. Undergraduates are accepted from colleges and universities nationwide. Students receive a $5,000 stipend for the program, and housing and travel allowances are available for select appointees.

## Key Components

### Week One Cancer Immersion

To ensure that all trainees start out with a solid understanding of cancer biology and the current state of cancer research, week one is devoted to interactive cancer research lectures (The Fundamentals of Cancer Biology, Current Cancer Therapies, Cancer Research Discovery Techniques, and tours of the state-of-the-art research facilities available at Case CCC). Social interactions allow students to get to know each other, learn how to work in teams, and establish critical networking skills.

### Mentored Research Experience

Scholars participate in a hands-on, cancer research experience including project development, execution, interpretation, and reporting of research results in select [Case CCC members’](https://case.edu/cancer/training-education/cansur/mentors) laboratories.

### Weekly Scientific and Career Enrichment Lunches

Scholars have the opportunity to discuss new advances in cancer research and cutting-edge technology. Scholars gain critical insight into professional development, including how to communicate and present research findings, guidance on preparing graduate/medical school applications, leadership training, and responsible conduct in research, among other topics.

### Cancer Career Opportunities Dinner

Scholars enjoy a meal with PhD and MD students, postdoctoral scholars, and hematology/oncology residents and fellows while learning about diverse cancer career opportunities in academia (PhD and MD/PhD paths), medicine, community outreach, and industry.

### CanSUR Symposium

Scholars present their research at a CanSUR Symposium during the final week of the program.
