### **General Information about SCUDEM**

**SCUDEM** — **S**IMIODE **C**hallenge **U**sing **D**ifferential **E**quations **M**odeling is a 3-student group modeling challenge that runs over multiple days culminating in a strict limit 10 minute video which is reviewed by at least 3 judges.

Teams choose one of the Challenge Problems provided in the areas of

* physics/engineering,
* chemistry/life sciences,
* social sciences,

and develop a model using differential or difference equations and a presentation.

Teams and Coaches may meet remotely or in person. Student challengers must work with their team without other animate assistance, including from their coach, during the challenge period. Team submissions will be judged *Outstanding*, *Meritorious*, or *Successful*.

Read the [**Complete Rules**](/community/groups/scudem/wiki/rules) for details of the challenge.

See [**problem statements and results for past events**](/community/groups/scudem/wiki/PastSCUDEMEvents) in our wiki. [SIMIODE's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SIMIODE) features presentations of past Outstanding Award recipients.

As a Judge, you have the opportunity to help students develop their mathematical modeling skills.  If you'd like to support our teams' intellectual growth, as well as help them to network, then please **[volunteer as a Judge for SCUDEM X 2025](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/scudem/judge-info)**

Consider **[volunteering as a Coach](/community/groups/scudem/coach-info)** for SCUDEM X 2025. Plan to start working with your team before SCUDEM begins in order to help prepare these energetic students for the modeling experience.
