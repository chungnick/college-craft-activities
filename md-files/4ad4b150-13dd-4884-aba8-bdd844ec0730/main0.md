## Our Mission

To spark interest in the future study of engineering among high school rising seniors who are unsure about their future plans.

## About Us

The MIT WTP is a rigorous four-week summer academic experience to introduce high school students to engineering through hands-on classes, labs, and team-based projects in the **summer after 11th grade**.

WTP is designed for students who are excited about learning, have demonstrated their ability to excel at math and science in their high school classes, and who have ***no prior background (or very little) in engineering***with few opportunities to explore these fields. This program is designed for students unsure about their future studies to help them explore the world of engineering and see if it’s the right fit.
