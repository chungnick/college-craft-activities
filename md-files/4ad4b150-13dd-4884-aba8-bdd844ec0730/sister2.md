Application opens in SlideRoom. For more information, visit the [Applications](https://wtp.mit.edu/application/) page.

## December 15

Deadline to submit WTP SlideRoom [Application](https://wtp.mit.edu/application/). We do not accept additional applications after this date **for ANY reason.** WTP applications reviews begin *after* the entire application pool has submitted their applications and continues until decisions are released in March. Note that WTP does ***not*** have rolling admissions.

## December 22

Submission date for Teacher References – this is an online Evaluation Form from one Math Teacher ***and*** one Science Teacher, NOT a letter of recommendation.

Please ask your teachers to complete their forms by this date (later submissions will be accepted until January 20, but they delay your application decision process).

## Mid-to-late March

Admissions notifications will be sent to applicants’ **email addresses**.

## Mid-April

Admitted applicants must confirm that they will attend WTP and submit required forms.

## June 27

WTP summer session begins with weekend orientation activities at MIT. Students will have required activities at MIT on weekdays, including some evening and weekend activities, for the four weeks WTP is in session. **They should not have any other significant time commitments during this time.**

Daily classes will occur Mon-Fri from approximately 9:30am – 5:00pm, with occasional evening hours. There will also be some weekend academic field trips and social outings.

## July 25

Final day of WTP.

Housing will be provided through the morning of July 25, when students will depart MIT.
