# FAQ

## WTP Program Overview

Who should apply to WTP?

[Check](https://wtp.mit.edu/FAQ/#who-should-apply) our [**Application**](https://wtp.mit.edu/application/) page for more information about who should apply and for our selection criteria.

What is the cost of the program?

**[FREE](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#cost-of-the-program): To apply to WTP**

**FREE: To attend WTP for students with family income less than $120,000**

Generous donations to WTP enable us to offer fee waivers and discounts for families with income less than $400,000 that cover more than half of the program expenses.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Family Adjusted Gross Income** | **Fee** |
| $120,000 or less | No cost to student |
| $120,000 to $150,000 | $2,000 |
| $150,000 to $200,000 | $4,000 |
| $200,000 to $400,000 | $8,000 |
| $400,000 or more | $20,000 |

If paying the fees listed above would be a financial hardship, admitted students should contact us to explore the possibility of additional financial aid. Admitted students should also contact us if transportation to and from Boston would cause financial hardship. **Our goal is that all admitted students be able to attend WTP.**

Housing and food during the program will be provided, as will all program materials. Students will be expected to bring a laptop to use for their coursework during the program. Loaners will be arranged free of charge for any student who needs one.

I am not in the 11th grade. Can students in other grades apply to WTP?

[You](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#11th-grade) **must** be in the 11th grade when you apply to WTP. We do not make any exceptions for students in earlier grades, even if they have taken advanced math and science classes.

You cannot apply if you are already in the 12th grade or have graduated high school. The WTP experience is designed for students who have completed 11th grade immediately before attending WTP, and who will be in 12th grade and presumably applying to college in the fall after attending WTP.

Is there a residency requirement? Am I eligible to apply if I’m not from the United States or am studying internationally? Do I have to be a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident to apply to WTP?

[All](https://wtp.mit.edu/FAQ/#residency-requirement) WTP applicants ***must live in the U.S. year round*** (your permanent family home address is in the U.S.). Students who live outside the U.S. are not eligible to apply to WTP.  
  
**Not eligible to apply:**

* Students who**live and attend school outside** the U.S. are ***not*** eligible to apply.
* Students whose family home address is **outside** the U.S. are ***not*** eligible to apply, **even if they attend a school in the U.S.**

**Eligible to apply:**

Students whose **permanent family home address** is in the U.S. and are attending boarding school outside the U.S., returning to the family home in the US for school breaks.

Will WTP be a Residential Program at MIT?

[Yes](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#residential-program)! The Mechanical Engineering track of WTP will be a residential program, with housing provided for the duration of the program in the MIT dorms.

Daily classes will occur Mon – Fri from approximately 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM, with occasional evening hours. We are planning some weekend academic field trips and social outings.

Students will be busy with WTP activities, both academic and social, most of the four weeks WTP is in session, including evenings and weekends. **Students should not expect to do other academic work, internships, or have a job; WTP will require all of your focus.**

Additional details will be given to admitted students in April, and before the program begins in June.

Does WTP exclude students who have already taken an engineering course in high school or at other summer programs?

[There](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#taken-an-engineering-course) is no simple answer to this question. It depends on the nature and depth of the student’s engineering background. We don’t outright “exclude” anyone, but will review the student’s application materials in the context of the other applications we receive and our curriculum. We are VERY focused on finding candidates with VERY little or ZERO engineering exposure.

If a student has taken an engineering course (or attended another summer engineering program) that covered much of our WTP curriculum, then they would probably **not** be a good candidate for WTP.

The WTP-ME curriculum focuses on the engineering design process as used in mechanical engineering. If you have taken an engineering class or had extensive experience with engineering design, you will not be a competitive candidate for WTP. We do not want students to be bored by attending classes at WTP that simply repeat material they have already seen, and the seat would better serve someone for whom the curriculum would be new.

I’m also applying to other MIT summer programs, such as MITES and/or RSI. Does WTP automatically get that information and count me as a WTP applicant?

**[You](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#applying-to-other-MIT-summer-program) must fill out and submit the [WTP Application](https://wtp.mit.edu/application/)to be sure you are considered for admission to the Women’s Technology Program.**Applying to other summer programs at MIT **does not** mean that WTP will learn about you. If you apply to WTP and want to apply to RSI and MITES, you must also complete their applications–your WTP application information is not sent to them.

Is it possible to receive high school credit for these courses?

[No](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#high-school-credit). WTP is not a certified academic program. It is taught by MIT students, not MIT professors, and the classes are not regular MIT classes.

You cannot receive internship credit (WTP is ***not*** an internship).

Who will teach the classes?

[The](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#who-will-teach) WTP class Instructors are MIT graduate students (or recently graduated MIT Master’s or PhD recipients). These Instructors are assisted by MIT or Wellesley undergraduate (or recently graduated) Tutors. Each spring we post information about the upcoming summer WTP staff’s academic and personal interests on the [**WTP-ME**](https://wtp.mit.edu/staff/) staff pages. There is a new staff of Instructors and Tutors every summer.

What is the size of the classes?

[Classes](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#size-of-the-classes) typically have 20 students. Daily and final class projects are done in teams, usually composed of 2 to 4 students.

Will I have any free time during WTP if I am admitted?

[Students](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#free-time-during-WTP) will be busy with WTP activities, both academic and social, most of the four weeks WTP is in session, including some evenings and weekends. WTP is not a “summer camp” but an intense academic experience, and has a very full schedule of activities. You must focus exclusively on WTP for the 4 weeks.

Students should not expect to do other academic work or internships. It will not be realistic to have a paid job during the 4 weeks of WTP.

WTP classes and hands-on activities will occur Monday-Friday from approximately 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM. You will also have evening assignments, primarily watching videos and answering concept questions designed to introduce you to the topics for the next day. We are also planning some weekend academic field trips and social outings.

## Application

How do I apply?

[Go](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#how-do-I-apply) to the [**Application**](https://wtp.mit.edu/application/) page and follow the directions there. We plan to post the application by the end of October each year. We do not accept additional applications after the December 15 submission deadline.

How do I send you my high school transcript ?

[You](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#high-school-transcript) must upload your transcript (Grades 9-10) as **attachments inside the online WTP application** before you can submit your application.

In the application, you will need to upload the follow:

* Grade 9-10 transcript
  + We will accept an**UNOFFICIAL** TRANSCRIPT or Report Card. It **MUST contain your full name, your school name, and if possible the school address.** The size limit is 10MB. The documents must be in English.
  + Many online Grade Reports do not meet these criteria, so you may have to request an unofficial transcript from your school registrar. Do not send us **links** to your online transcripts; we will not be able to access them. **Do not ask your Counselor to email WTP your transcripts** – **you must directly upload them yourself to your online application.**
* Grade 11 Fall Report
  + Attach your fall first quarter OR first semester grades. This could be a report card or a screenshot of your schools online grade portal. If you don’t have any grades yet, even in progress ones, please upload a list of your fall classes.
  + Make sure your full name and, if possible, your school name are listed visible in the uploaded file.

**You will not be able to submit your WTP application without uploading items 1 and 2 above. Not having fall grades at the time you submit your application will not affect your likelihood of admission.**

Please **DO NOT send us any other Grade 11 semester-end updates after your application is submitted**.

Can I include a copy of my resume with my application?

[No](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#resume). We do not want resumes, or long lists of awards or extracurricular activities. Please ONLY provide the information asked for in the online application. Please DO NOT send us updates about awards or other achievements after you submit your application.

**The ONLY information we accept by email after you submit your application is additional test scores (PSAT, ACT, SAT) if your scores have changed significantly.** (Note we can only include additional transcripts and scores until February 15.)

What if I haven’t taken the standardized tests listed on the application? What if I’ve taken a test but don’t have my scores yet?

[We](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#standardized-tests) understand that some 11th grade students have not yet taken any standardized tests–and **we certainly do not expect you to have taken all of them!**

Although scores are a useful element in our selection process, they are less important than other parts of the WTP application. **Standardized tests are not a requirement for acceptance to WTP** and we will still consider your application carefully if you do not have any standardized test scores. However, given the number of applicants, standardized math and science test scores give us additional information to help us evaluate students from different school systems.

We only ask you for **your *highest* scores**. While accepted students typically have math test scores in the 90th percentile or higher, this is not a firm requirement; we do accept students with lower or no test scores.

Note that WTP cannot get score reports from the College Board or ACT. You will upload .pdfs of your Score Reports as attachments in your online WTP application. Ensure that your full name is on all score reports.

If you receive test scores *after* submitting your WTP application, we can still include them until Jan 20. Email your score report as a .pdf attachment to [wtp@mit.edu](mailto:wtp@mit.edu) and we will add it to your application. **We cannot accept additional scores after January 20.**

How do I include my test scores (PSAT, SAT, ACT, or AP) in my WTP application? How do I include new scores I receive after submitting my WTP application?

[You](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#test-scores) will upload .pdfs of your Score Reports as Attachments in your online WTP application. Note that WTP cannot get score reports from the College Board or ACT.

In your WTP application, first fill out the “Test Scores Form.” We do not expect you to have taken ALL of these tests! If you have not taken any of these tests, check that box.

ONLY check the boxes for tests you have TAKEN. If you are waiting for a score report, please ALSO check the box corresponding to “I have taken tests but not received my scores yet”. Do not check the box if you intend to take the test in the future.

You must also complete the questons listing your highest scores in any tests you have taken, or “pending” for tests you have taken but not yet received your scores.

Next, upload your score reports in the Attachments section of the WTP SlideRoom application for the tests you listed in the Test Scores Form questions. To upload your score reports, first create a .pdf document; you may scan paper score reports or capture online screen shots of your test scores. NOTE: **Your FULL NAME MUST BE VISIBLE on the page/report with your scores.** If possible, please combine all of your score reports into one .pdf document and upload it . Size limit: 10MB.

There are free online sites where you can merge .pdf files into one document and also convert other file formats (.png, .tif, .jpg) to .pdf documents. If you are unable to merge all of your scores into one document, we have provided two additional score report attachment sites in the application.

**DO NOT request that the College Board send official test scores to MIT for the WTP application.**Those scores will go to MIT Admissions; we will not be able to access them at WTP. We also cannot access links to your online score reports. Here are some examples of score report attachments we accept for [PSAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sample-psat-nmsqt-score-report.pdf), [SAT](https://web.mit.edu/wtp/SAT%20Sample%20Report%20After%20March2016.pdf), [ACT.](https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/2021-2022-Student-Rpt-with-Write-sample-data.pdf) The report scores should be for actual tests you took officially, not practice pre-tests.

**Standardized test scores are NOT a requirement for WTP admission;** you may still apply to WTP if you have not taken *any* of these tests. If you have no score reports to upload, instead upload a note to the Score Reports Attachment saying you have not taken or received your scores for any of these tests (since you cannot leave this attachment slot empty). Without these scores, we will evaluate your application based on your transcript math courses and grades.

If you receive pending score reports after you submit your application, please email your score reports to [wtp@mit.edu](mailto:wtp@mit.edu). We can add them to your application **until January 20 (but not later).**

If you take additional tests **after** you submit your WTP application, and your scores are significantly different from what you already attached to your application, you may email your score reports to [wtp@mit.edu](mailto:wtp@mit.edu). We can add them to your application **until January 20 (but not later).**

How do I choose my references? Should my 11th or 10th grade math and science teachers be my References? Can my Computer Science teacher be a Reference?

[It](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#choose-my-references) is best to choose a Math and Science Teacher who know you well. They do not have to be 11th grade teachers. In some cases, your 10th grade teachers, or teachers who coach your math, robotics, or science team, may know you better.

To give your teachers a preview of what to expect, please send them the link to this **[Guidelines for Teacher References](https://wtp.mit.edu/files/2025/06/Guidelines-for-Teacher-Reference-WTP-Application.pdf)** when you ask them to serve as a WTP Reference. If they agree, add them as a Reference to your application; they should then receive an email invitation to complete an online form (they must complete the form in one session). See the next FAQ for Teacher Reference tech support.

Please **DO NOT ask a Computer Science teacher**to be one of your References. We find information from a science teacher who teaches classes in physics, biology, or chemistry (or is a science team coach) or from a math teacher who teaches algebra, pre-calculus, geometry, calculus, or statistics (or is a math team coach) much more useful for admissions decisions than a computer science teacher.

What do I do if my Reference did not receive an email from SlideRoom with the link to my application? What if they need to make changes to the form after submitting it?

[If](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#reference-did-not-receive-an-email) your Teacher References do not receive the email, have them check their spam file, and also make sure the email you listed for them in your application is correct (no typos). If your teachers *still* cannot find the email, visit the SlideRoom Applicant Help Center [**References Help link.**](https://help.liaisonedu.com/SlideRoom_Applicant_Help_Center/Completing_Your_SlideRoom_Application/02_Working_with_References)

Even after submitting your WTP student part of the application you can manage your References. Note that we initially ask Teachers to complete their Reference Forms by December 22nd (a week after the student WTP application deadline) but we will continue to accept completed Teacher Reference Forms until January 20. However, **since your application is not complete until we receive both Teacher References**, we cannot begin reviewing your application without them.

If your References need to make any changes after submitting the Form, have them send an email to [wtp@mit.edu](mailto:wtp@mit.edu) and we can *unsubmit* the Form, allowing them to change or add new information and then resubmit the Form.

Can I send in extra letters of recommendation that I feel will make my application stronger?

[No](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#extra-letters-of-recommendation). If we receive letters of support or emails from your Guidance Counselor, Principal, MIT Alumni, or others recommending you for WTP admission, these materials will not be included in your application file. We only want the two Teacher Reference Forms (one Math, one Science) for your WTP application.

What advice can you give me about writing the three essay questions in the application?

[The](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#essay-questions) essays are a VERY important part of your WTP application. We ask you to write long answers to three questions to help us better understand your interests and who you are.

Each essay answer should be **a minimum of 275 words** — and less than 2000 characters (approximately 334 words). There is a count below each text box, and you will not be allowed to enter additional text beyond 2000 characters. If any of your essays is less than 275 words you will be less competitive with other applicants.

These answers should be **personal** responses, not abstract, impersonal essay writing you might do for a class assignment. Please write about different topics for each question, so we gain broader insights into your interests. Do not fill the text block with lists of your extracurricular activities or your resume. Please follow the directions carefully for each essay.

The essays are your opportunity to help us get to know you in ways not represented by your test scores and grades, to “put a face” on your application.

The three required essay questions for WTP are:

1. Tell us about ONE of your activities that is important to you, and why you are passionate about it.
2. Why do YOU want to learn about mechanical engineering at the Women’s Technology Program? What do you hope to accomplish by attending?
3. Describe a personal, social, or academic challenge you have faced and how you responded to it.

Can I send additional materials after submitting my application?

[The](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#additional-materials) ONLY information we accept by email after you submit your application is additional test scores (PSAT, ACT, SAT) if your scores have changed significantly.  (Note we can only include additional transcripts and scores until February 15.)

**Please DO NOT send us updates about awards or other achievements after you submit your application.**

How will I know that my entire application is complete?

[When](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#application-is-complete) you submit your WTP application through SlideRoom you will see a screen shot automatic confirmation. However, **your application is NOT complete until we receive both of your Teacher References**.

**It is the applicant’s responsibility to make sure the application is complete by taking the steps below.** WTP does **not** send out email messages confirming applications are submitted or complete.

**To****Complete Your Application:**

1) **Check the status of your Teacher References by logging into SlideRoom —**you can do this even after submitting your application. Click on the word “Completed” in the left column. Talk to your Teachers if they have not completed the online forms and make sure they received the Reference request email. You can check and correct their email addresses, and resend the email reminder to your teacher yourself within SlideRoom even after you submit your part of the application.

If your Teachers have not submitted their References by the Teacher Reference deadline of December 22, please ask them to do so as soon as possible in order to complete your application to WTP. We will accept References **until January 29**, but it delays evaluation of your application. If your teachers cannot find the email, contact SlideRoom directly for technical support at the [Help Center link](https://help.liaisonedu.com/SlideRoom_Applicant_Help_Center).

Please **DO NOT** send us any additional Grade 11 updates.

2)**If you receive additional test scores with significant score changes after submitting your application**, email your score report or screen shot as an attachment to [wtp@mit.edu](mailto: wtp@mit.edu) and we will add them to your application**ONLY until February 15 (we will not accept them after that)**. NOTE that your FULL NAME MUST BE VISIBLE on the pages or screen shot with your scores. Size limit: 10MB.

## Admissions

How many students will be admitted?

[We](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#how-many-students) expect to admit 20 students to WTP. We will also select a waiting list of about 15 students, in case any of the original students admitted cannot attend. We do not add any denied students to the waiting list after admissions decisions are sent. Historically we have received 380-650 completed applications each year.

How difficult is it to get into the program?

[Admissions](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#how-difficult-is-it-to-get-in) is very competitive, because this year we have space to admit only 20 students. We typically receive >300 applications each year from highly qualified candidates for the 20 WTP-ME slots.

We choose students whose interests are a good fit for WTP: they have not already covered our curriculum in their high school classes, in other summer or after-school programs, or through self-study online. The purpose of WTP is to reach bright students who are not yet committed to pursuing engineering who may have felt discouraged from participation in STEM activities, and who want to spend the summer learning about these fields.

Successful applicants show enthusiasm for exploring ME for the first time. They have strong academic records in science and math, excellent teacher evaluations, work well in teams, and have demonstrated maturity, initiative, and a love of learning. We ask for scores on the PSAT, SAT, or ACT, or math and science AP or SAT Subject tests, but if you have not taken these tests will still consider your application without them.  The highest math test score for admitted students is typically in the 90th percentile or higher.

When and how will I find out if I am admitted?

[Admissions](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#find-out-if-I-am-admitted) decisions are sent by email to the address you listed in your WTP SlideRoom application. We expect to notify students in late March. Students will be informed whether they are admitted to WTP, or put onto a waitlist, or denied. We do not add additional people from the denied group to the waitlist after decisions are made.

**If the email address you provided in your WTP application changes, please send us the update so you can continue to receive our messages.** Set your spam filter to allow messages from @mit.edu so our communications with you do not end up in your spam file. If you do not see our message in your inbox or spam file within 24 hours of our decisions date, contact WTP by email for your status.

In mid-April admitted students must confirm that they will attend WTP. Accepted students must be able to participate in WTP for the **full four weeks.**

What do I do if I’m admitted to another summer opportunity, and need an early decision?

[If](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#early-decision) you are admitted to another summer program or offered a summer internship ***before*** you hear from WTP, [please notify us as soon as possible,](mailto:wtp@mit.edu)to either request an early decision from WTP, or to withdraw your WTP application***.***

Tell us the ***date by which you need to inform the other summer opportunity*** of your decision***,***so we can give you the status of your WTP application before then. That way you can make a more informed decision about all of your summer choices.

This includes other MIT summer programs that may accept you — we will not have that information even though the programs are at MIT.

If your summer plans change for any reason and you no longer want to be considered for WTP admission.

[If](https://wtp.mit.edu/faq/#summer-plans-change) your summer plans change for ***any*** reason and you no longer would be able to attend WTP if accepted, please [email us](mailto:wtp@mit.edu) as soon as you make that decision (**ideally before March 15th**).

This includes summer employment, family plans, or any other summer programs or internship opportunities.
