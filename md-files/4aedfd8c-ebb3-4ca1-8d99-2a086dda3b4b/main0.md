### **Your Summer, Your AI Journey!**

Imagine a summer exploring artificial intelligence alongside passionate peers, guided by Carnegie Mellon’s leading faculty. AI Scholars is a fully funded, merit-based program for rising high school seniors to develop real-world skills, gain mentorship, and take the first step toward your future in tech. During this four-week immersive program, scholars will engage in classroom instruction, research projects, faculty lectures, and industry experiences, gaining real-world experience while exploring one of today’s most exciting fields.

## Program Overview

As an AI Scholar, you will dive into college-level courses and weekly college prep seminars covering admissions, financial aid, and social-emotional wellbeing. Through project-based learning, you’ll explore computing and AI concepts while collaborating on hands-on group projects that tackle real-world challenges and culminate in a final symposium presentation. You’ll also connect with industry leaders, gain mentorship from faculty, and build lasting relationships with peers all while experiencing life on a college campus. A core value of the AI Scholars program is a commitment to an inclusive, equitable community where all participants feel valued and supported; scholars are expected to uphold this value and actively contribute to a culture of respect and belonging.

AI Scholars is a fully funded, merit-based program that brings together students from across the country to learn directly from CMU faculty, staff, and researchers. Thanks to generous support from foundations, corporations, sponsors, and donors, all program costs are covered, including\*:

* Tuition
* Housing
* Meal plans
* Select program-related field trips and special events

*\*Limited travel assistance is available for families facing transportation barriers.*

## Testimonials

My experience at Carnegie Mellon Pre College Programs was truly life-changing. Something I'll never forget. The program not only challenged me academically but also provided valuable learning experiences and chances for personal development fueling my interest in computer science and AI. Collaborating on projects, with encouraging classmates and professors helped me grow both professionally and personally. The lively campus atmosphere and strong sense of belonging made my time incredibly fulfilling and motivating solidifying my decision to pursue computer science at CMU for my studies. ~ Eli T., AI Scholars 2024

I’m blown away… this program has been an amazing experience for Vincent and it’s been a wonderful growth to see in him. He came back curious and limitless; daring to attempt impossible things and has not stopped asking “what if … ?” instead of stating “No, because….” ~ Anonymous (Parent), AI Scholars 2023

**All applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered.**

## Is this program only for students with financial need?

The AI Scholars program is intended to create opportunities for students who lack access and/or resources at home, at school, or in their communities. This can mean financial need, it can mean a lack of computer science education in your school district or community, or lack of access to affordable/stable internet or computing devices. We recognize that students may not meet the current financial need requirements, but may still lack access or opportunity for other reasons. If any of this resonates with your experience, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are still unsure if this program is for you, please reach out to Natalie Hatcher at [nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu).
