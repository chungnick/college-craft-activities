The University of Maryland’s School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures (SLLC) Summer Language Courses offer language and culture programs for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students of Arabic, Korean, and Persian.

These programs run for a combined total of nine weeks across two sessions in a hybrid in-person and online format. Students will receive six transferable, academic credits for their participation in Session 1 (June 8 - July 8) of the program, which will be held in person on the University of Maryland campus, and four credits for participating in Session 2 (July 13 - August 7) of the program which will be conducted virtually.

Both sessions of the Summer Language Institute will feature the following:

* Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced level training
* Time with language partners for additional support, speaking practice, and tutoring
* Competitive Summer Institute Scholarships available to help offset the cost of attendance
* A focus on building listening comprehension skills through media and current events
* Proximity to Washington, DC, allowing for a rich calendar of weekly cultural events and lectures, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with government and business professionals
* Small class sizes, a minimum of 20 contact hours per week, and dedicated faculty and staff members

While it is not mandatory to do both sessions, the content covered in Session 2 will be built upon instruction conducted in Session 1. Students will complete placement testing to determine which level will be the best fit.

### Who Should Apply?

Our program is open to all talented students of Arabic, Korean, and Persian (rising High School seniors, Incoming Freshmen, Undergraduate Students, Graduate Students, Military, Working Professionals, etc). The average student attending will have made a serious, long-term commitment to learning their target language, be prepared to study intensively for nine weeks, and be performing well academically at their home institution. Due to the intensive nature of the Summer Institute, it will not be possible to take other courses or work during the program.

While we are unable to offer student visas to international students, we are happy to admit international students already in the U.S. on a student visa from UMD or another institution.

### Registration & Financial Aid

## Summer Institute Scholarships

Additional competitive scholarships are available for Summer Institute attendees. These scholarships generally range from $500 - $1,500. UMD Summer Institute Scholarships require a separate application.

Students who apply before the April 17th Priority Deadline will receive the scholarship application along with their acceptance notice.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us ([umdsi@umd.edu)](mailto:umdsi@umd.edu)).

## Registration & Transcripts

Students accepted to the Summer Language Institute are registered for 10 undergraduate credits (6 for Session I and 4 for Session II) at the University of Maryland during the summer term. Enrollment in SLI courses is managed by SLI staff, and accepted students will receive further instructions about registering for SLI courses and any academic blocks from the Program Coordinator. Students that are not enrolled at the University of Maryland during the academic year are registered as visiting students, and will receive a UMD transcript showing their credits and grade at the end of the summer. These credits can generally be transferred back to their home institutions. All non-UMD applicants who wish to transfer credits should reach out to their own university's transfer credits office and the relevant language department before attending SLI to clarify what the transfer process will require, as it varies by institution.

SLI courses follow the University of Maryland's [plus/minus grading system](http://registrar.umd.edu/current/Policies/acadregs.html#plusminus). There is no option to take SLI with pass-fail or audit grading. Current UMD students taking SLI courses will see their SLI grades reflected on their cumulative GPA and transcript.
