# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### SoSC: introduces students to topics in engineering, computer science and technology to make cities more sustainable, efficient and safer. Working in teams, students design projects using what they learn about electronics and circuitry, coding, microcontrollers, sensors and other hardware. During final presentations, students demonstrate how their project creatively provides a solution to a real-world challenge.

###### Electronics and circuit design

###### Programming and sensor integration

###### Environmental science projects

###### Team project development

### Explore the technology behind smart cities while developing sustainable solutions for urban challenges

The NYU Tandon School of Engineering was buzzing with energy on July 28 — quite literally in some cases — as dozens of parents, faculty and friends joined for the Science of Smart Cities (SoSC) expo.

Smart bridge technology, solar energy innovations, climate-measuring drones and smart landfill monitors were among the displays that were shown during the expo.

On a recent August afternoon in Brooklyn, dozens of summer camp students swarmed around cities of their own creation. Sure, they were mostly built out of Legos, small sensors and cardboard, but they were thoughtfully laid out with carefully designed infrastructure. One such city was Meracia, a name that is less exotic than first appearance.

“It’s actually just America with all the letters scrambled,” said Elizabeth, 12, who worked on Meracia.
