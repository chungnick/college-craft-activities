## Camp Information

### Application Requirements

Applicants must have completed one year of high school math and science. This camp is for high school students who are rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors interested in the sciences. Seats are limited. The priority application deadline is March 15, 2025. Rolling admission thereafter will be based on available space. All priority applicants will be notified of acceptance decisions on or before April 1, 2025.

In addition to general parent and student information, the application form will request:

* A 250-word student statement about their interest in the sciences and what they would like to learn by participating
* Name and email contact information for a teacher recommendation. This teacher should be in the student’s high school and have taught the student in a STEM subject (science, technology, math, or pre-engineering subjects). The letter should express the student’s interest in the sciences or STEM-related fields. Please have the student ask the teacher to be a recommender before applying.
