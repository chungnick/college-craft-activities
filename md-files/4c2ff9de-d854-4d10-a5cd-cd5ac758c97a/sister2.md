### Community Impact & Economic Development

We believe in the power of hydroponics to drive economic growth and address pressing social issues like food insecurity. IA Labs provides business advice and commercialization support to help local entrepreneurs succeed. Additionally, we work with communities to develop strategies for increasing access to fresh, locally-grown produce, thereby enhancing food security and overall well-being.

## What is Hydroponics?

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water solutions to deliver essential minerals directly to the plant roots. This innovative approach to agriculture allows for year-round cultivation in controlled environments, making it possible to grow fresh produce in urban settings, deserts, and even space!

By eliminating the need for soil, hydroponics reduces water usage by up to 90% compared to traditional farming methods. It also minimizes the use of pesticides and fertilizers, resulting in cleaner and more sustainable food production. At IA Labs, we are at the forefront of exploring the potential of hydroponics to revolutionize agriculture and contribute to a more sustainable future.
