##### HIGH SCHOOLS

The University of Georgia Young Dawgs Program is a high school internship program
designed to prepare high-achieving high school juniors and seniors for post-secondary
education and future careers in their areas of interest.  The program is open to students
from public, private, and home schools. The main requirement of the program is that
the student has a minimum 3.8 GPA.

During the school year, students are able to get high school credit by working through
the Work-Based Learning Program or Gifted Program at their school. Home-School students
can also receive credit if within the home-school curriculum.  The school works in
coordination with Young Dawgs to provide the credit.

If a high school or an individual student is interested in learning more about the
Young Dawgs Program please contact Jim Geiser at [jgeiser@uga.edu](mailto:jgeiser@uga.edu).
