# Design Discovery

UNLOCKING CREATIVITY + EMPOWERING YOUTH THROUGH DESIGN-THINKING

# Design Discovery Youth Summer Program

Design Discovery is a 6-day summer program hosted by the UVA School of Architecture that invites high school students of all backgrounds to explore design school and the design process. We offer two sessions each summer that demystify design and introduce it as an amazing way of seeing and working in the world.

---

#### SUMMER 2026 APPLICATIONS ARE NOW OPEN!

---

At UVA Design Discovery participants engage in both academic and real-world settings through design/build workshops, an architecture firm visit, and a tour of an active construction site. Our daily ‘I See Me’ lunch and learn series features conversations with a diverse cross-section of professionals, faculty, and students. Each session culminates in a 'Celebration of Work' exhibition with food, families, and community partners.
