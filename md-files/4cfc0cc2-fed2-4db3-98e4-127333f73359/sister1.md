## **Scholarship Opportunities**

Georgetown University Summer Programs offer a limited number of need-based scholarships for eligible students admitted to Summer College, College Prep, or Academy programs. Scholarships are awarded for tuition only and are not guaranteed, as funding is limited and competitive.

Deadlines vary by program, and award decisions are released in the spring. A detailed breakdown of scholarship deadlines, requirements, and award timelines is provided in the sections that follow.
