# Accelerated Learning Program (ALP)

[Apply for ALP](https://reg.cerc.wisc.edu/HpHEDmC7/5a1bHpM7Ot0)

The Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) admits high school students from Wisconsin, across the United States, and around the globe to engage in three immersive weeks of fast-paced, rigorous, and hands-on learning at the top-ranked University of Wisconsin–Madison. Through a single, non-credit course, students explore advanced academic content while participating in experiential education that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world application. ALP is designed to elevate each learner’s academic journey. Students may be able to coordinate with their schools to earn high school credit upon successful completion of the program. Limited [need-based scholarships](https://precollege.wisc.edu/financial-information/) are available on a rolling basis to help ensure access for all qualified participants

This year, the [Wisconsin International Precollege Academy](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wisconsin-international-precollege-academy/) will become a part of the Accelerated Learning Program as an academic track. This means students participating in WIPA would be a part of the ALP Program in the international college readiness track.

### Why ALP

Summer offers many options for motivated high school students, but the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) at UW–Madison provides something truly special: the chance to live and learn on a world-class campus while diving deep into a subject of interest. Though UW–Madison is a large university, ALP creates a close, welcoming academic community where students can focus on one intensive course over three weeks. This immersive format allows for meaningful exploration, hands-on learning, and personal growth — opportunities that are often hard to find in a typical high school schedule.

ALP courses are taught by knowledgeable instructors who specialize in their subject areas and tailor material for high school students. Each class is designed to be accelerated and engaging, with a focus on creating a supportive and personalized learning environment. Small class sizes allow instructors to get to know students individually, helping them set learning goals and adjust coursework to be appropriately challenging. Courses begin with a pre-assessment to better understand each student’s strengths and background knowledge. Undergraduate/graduate teaching assistants also support the classroom experience, offering additional help and guidance throughout the program.

Time outside of class is thoughtfully planned and coordinated by residential staff. The residential experiences provides students the opportunity to connect with their peers through small and large group activities. Events and activities are intentionally hosted in and outside of  the dorm space to foster social and emotional growth. Students will be able to choose from art-focused, sport-related fun, Olympic-style challenges, and performative-based activities.

---

### What to expect

Students are in class each weekday with a morning class session, an afternoon class session, and a required study session to finish up the academic day. Students should be prepared to interact, learn, and grow at an accelerated pace while exploring their chosen course topic. Students are encouraged to bring a sense of maturity and respect to all aspects of the program — from preparing for class and engaging in activities, to interacting with peers, staff, and the broader UW–Madison community. Students will be able to utilize campus resources and develop greater independence as learners, with support tailored to a variety of learning styles and strengths. By the end of the program, students often see growth in time management, project planning, and a deeper understanding of their interest, abilities and learning pathway preferences.

Residential students get a true taste of college life as they settle into UW–Madison’s vibrant campus community. From living in the dorms to exploring the university and nearby neighborhoods, every day brings new opportunities to connect, discover, and grow. Coordinated activities and free time create space for friendships to flourish. It’s more than just a place to stay — it’s a place to belong.

Commuter students participate in the program on weekdays, attending engaging academic sessions and returning home once the day concludes. While they don’t reside on campus, commuter students benefit from the full academic experience. This format allows students to immerse themselves in challenging coursework and build valuable skills, all while maintaining their home routines. With parent or guardian permission, they may arrange their own daily transportation to and from campus.

**“I enjoyed this program so much. It was amazing to be able to use all of the materials that we used during the labs, and I really enjoyed being on campus. It has definitely increased my interest in science in college.”**

**– 2024 ALP Student**

New this year is the ALP Academic Track for International Students in the Wisconsin International Precollege Academy. An academic track is a structured pathway or specialization within an educational program. It guides a student’s overall learning focus and long-term goals. It is different from a class in ALP, as a class is a specific course you take within the three-week program.  Click here to find out more information on the [WIPA International Track.](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wisconsin-international-precollege-academy/)

residential

Residential students get a true taste of college life as they settle into UW–Madison’s vibrant campus community. From living in the dorms to exploring the university and nearby neighborhoods, every day brings new opportunities to connect, discover, and grow. Coordinated activities and free time create space for friendships to flourish. It’s more than just a place to stay — it’s a place to belong.

**Housing and Meals**

Residential student tuition covers the cost to live in one of the residence halls on campus and three meals provided by one of our buffet-style dining halls.

**Activities**

Throughout the program, students join group outings led by our Residential Assistants to explore Madison, Wisconsin. From walks down State Street to exploring campus,  these excursions offer a great way to experience the city together. In the dorms, students can unwind or dive into a variety of residential activities, including:

* Trivia games and bracelet making
* Nature walks and art classes
* Board games, reading, and relaxation
* Shopping trips and movie nights
* Campfires and casual hangouts

As with all Badger Precollege programs, students have access to a supportive team of residential assistants, instructors, and administrative staff who are always available to help with questions, guidance, or just a friendly chat.

**Free Time**

An important part of any precollege experience is the opportunity for students to explore and practice autonomy while in a new setting. With a balance of unstructured and structured free time students can socialize and try new things, but also take time for independence and relaxation. Each day is scheduled for students to have a level of freedom while adhering to boundaries and timeframes. They will have freetime in the afternoon after classes and workshops and again after dinner. Each period of free time also features optional activities organized by residential staff, which students may participate in if they would like.

**Weekends**

Each weekend we offer day trips for students to experience things like the Iconic Devil’s Lake State Park; one of the aquarium and museum visits, and shopping in Downtown Chicago. These trips are optional and students can sign-up to participate at an added cost once admitted into the program. More information about this summer’s weekend trips will be provided after admission to the program has been determined.

**Weekend Trips**

Each weekend we offer day trips for students to experience things like the Milwaukee Zoo and a Milwaukee Brewer’s game; one of the amazing waterparks in the Wisconsin Dells; aquarium and museum visits, and shopping in Downtown Chicago. These trips are optional and students can sign-up to participate at an added cost once admitted into the program. More information about this summer’s weekend trips will be provided after admission to the program has been determined.

### Getting to the program

All international students should arrive to Madison, WI one day prior to the official program start date. For ALP, this will be on Saturday, June 27th. The purpose of this is so Badger Precollege can facilitate an International Student Orientation on Sunday morning before the remaining participants arrive. After acceptance, the Badger Precollege team will provide students with additional information regarding the best airports to utilize, timeframes for arrival, and opportunities for shuttles. All housing and meals are included in the tuition costs.

### Travel requirements and visas

The University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) have determined that summer programs offered by Badger Precollege serving precollege students at UW–Madison are programs that require a B-1 or B-2 visitor visa for any non-U.S. citizen or non-permanent resident.

The B-2 visa is for individuals traveling to the U.S. for: **Tourism, Visiting family or friends, Receiving medical treatment, or Participating in social or recreational events.** It does *not* permit employment or long-term study.

As of 2025, B-2 tourist visa applicants to the United States face stricter screening, higher fees, and earlier application deadlines. These updates are designed to improve security and reduce processing delays.

To qualify for a B-2 visa, applicants must:

1. Have a clear and temporary purpose for visiting.
2. Show financial ability to cover their trip.
3. Prove intent to return to their home country after the visit.

Application Process

1. Complete Form DS-160 online.
2. Pay the visa fee.
3. Schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate.
4. Attend the interview with appropriate documentation:
   1. Valid passport DS-160 confirmation page
   2. Visa fee receipt
   3. Supporting documents (e.g., travel itinerary, financial proof, ties to home country)

International student applicants are strongly encouraged to bring their program admission letter, among other supporting documents, to their visa interview at the U.S. Embassy. The process of obtaining visa and travel documents is the responsibility of the student applicant. The University of Wisconsin–Madison cannot advise students on visa procedures or eligibility. For more information about the application and required travel documents, view the [**B-1 or B-2 VISA Form**](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/obtaining-a-B1-B2-Visa.pdf), contact the Badger Precollege office or visit the [**U.S. State Department website**](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visitor.html).

### Cancelations and Refunds

Badger Precollege reserves the right to cancel classes when necessary, including those for which enrollment numbers are not sufficient, or those for which a highly qualified instructor is unavailable. In the case of course cancellations, we will be happy to help you choose an alternative course. If no acceptable alternative is available, we will refund any tuition paid, minus any non-refundable application fees. We will also work with families to process refunds in the case of student illness or injury.

Refunds may take up to eight weeks to process, starting from the time a written request is received by the Badger Precollege office.

To view the full refund policy and other financial policies, please visit our [financial information page.](https://precollege.wisc.edu/financial-information/)
