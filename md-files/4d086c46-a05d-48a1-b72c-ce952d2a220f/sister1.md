### Nonrefundable fees and cancellations

\*Registration/application fees: cover registration/application fees, customer service, application review or processing, and administrative costs during this program planning period.

\*\* Badger Precollege reserves the right to cancel classes when necessary, including those for which enrollment numbers are not sufficient, or those for which a highly qualified instructor is unavailable. In the following cases, Badger Precollege will consider a full refund of any program fees minus the registration/application fee: (1) a course of choice is cancelled, (2) all course choices are closed, (3) scholarship offer doesn’t cover enough, or (4) in case of student injury or illness.

### Scholarship Policies

Badger Precollege has varied funds to provide assistance to Wisconsin youth who demonstrate financial need. ***Funds available for scholarships are limited*** and are distributed based on individual program policies. We encourage you to submit scholarship information early. Available funds for scholarship awards vary from year to year, and past scholarship awards may not be an indication of current available support. Applicants should also inquire about local financial support through their schools, businesses, service organizations, etc. to see if local money is available for program costs.

**Please note:** We advise you to visit your program webpage and review scholarship information listed there to ensure you are completing the program-specific process.

* Applications for scholarships will be reviewed by the Badger Precollege Scholarship Committee.
* All requests will be answered and maintained confidentially. The Badger Precollege scholarship committee is committed to making an allocation of scholarship funds to allow the largest possible number of students to receive the necessary financial support to attend our programs.
* Consideration of scholarship assistance is determined by analyzing family income and extenuating economic circumstances with guidance from the [Income Eligibility Guidelines](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/income-eligibility-guidelines) used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s School Lunch Program.
* The scholarship application process is in tandem with the overall registration/application process and varies based on the Badger Precollege program that student is applying for. Individual policies for ***each program will be shared on that specific program website***.
* For multi-session programs, scholarships are limited to one week-long session per student per program (for example PACE runs three one–week sessions. One student can request a scholarship for a maximum of one of the three sessions running in the same summer season. The same student can still apply for scholarships for other Badger Precollege middle school programs like STEP or SMC Junior)
* Full Scholarship awards are available primarily for Wisconsin students.
* Limited scholarship awards up to 50% of total tuition costs are available for out-of-state students.
* The only support for international participants is for the WIPA Program or SIL Program. Please visit the[**International**](https://precollege.wisc.edu/international-student-resources/) page for more scholarship information.
* All materials supporting your scholarship application must be received no later than **April 1, 2026.**
* Families will be required to submit their intent to accept scholarship support. Failure to do so by the deadline posted in your award letter may result in a loss of partial or full aid award.
* Additional information (essay, interview, phone conversation, etc.) may be requested from students and/or families prior to notification of aid.
* If you receive a scholarship for the program to which you have registered/applied, you will receive an invoice after the scholarship award amount is applied. If you receive a partial scholarship for your program, then you are responsible for paying the remaining balance.
