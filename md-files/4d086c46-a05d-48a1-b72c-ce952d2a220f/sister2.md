You may submit the most recent grade report you have for your child, this may include midterm grade reports. If your child is home-schooled we are flexible; past home-schooled students submitted examples of their work which they believed best represented their abilities.

Applications are reviewed and students are accepted on a rolling basis. Typically you may expect to receive a decision within 2-4 weeks of applying.

Once a student has been accepted, they will receive communication to the email address provided upon applying. Included is information on acceptance, and various forms which parents and students should complete together and return to Badger Precollege using the instructions provided. [ALP](https://precollege.wisc.edu/alp) students may also have the opportunity to sign up for additional weekend experiences.

Staffing

### Precollege staffing information

#### Tell me about the Badger Precollege instructors.

Many of our instructors return to teach year after year and bring with them a passion for their field or subject matter — and for educating young learners. Instructor backgrounds vary, from seasoned classroom educators and innovative professionals to current UW–Madison faculty and aspiring academics eager to share their knowledge with our students and our community.

Program leaders include UW–Madison faculty and staff who are experts in their academic fields, as well as other university employees, students, and volunteers. We use background checks to screen all adults who interact with minors and require them to complete training in youth protection, health and safety. Find more about our [commitment to youth safety](https://precollege.wisc.edu/safety-commitment/).

#### Who supervises students in residential programs after they are done with class?

Students remain under the supervision of trained program staff at all times while participating in Badger Precollege programs. Each student will be assigned to a Residential Assistant (RA), who is typically a college student or young professional. Each RA is responsible for approximately 12–14 students and will live in their students’ section of the residence hall. The RAs are responsible for the residential aspects of camp and work closely with Badger Precollege students to create a fun and educational atmosphere.

#### Who can I contact if I have more program-specific questions?

Please complete the [form below](https://precollege.wisc.edu/faqs/#form) and be sure to include your program-specific questions.

Logistics

### Programming logistics

#### How do I communicate special circumstances or accommodation needs to the program?

Badger Precollege is committed to equal access for all our students and strives to provide accommodations in as many ways as possible. If you are a person with a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to participate in one of our programs, please fill out the accommodations form provided after registering or being accepted into your Badger Precollege program. Requests must be made with this form and will not be accepted via email or other mode of communication. Allocation of accommodations is subject to youth programming policies on the UW-Madison campus and may be provided in collaboration with the McBurney Disability Resource Center. If Badger Precollege does not have sufficient time to review, determine, or plan for a reasonable accommodation, supporting your request may not be possible. If you have any questions about accommodations or filling out the form, please contact [info@precollege.wisc.edu](mailto:info@precollege.wisc.edu). Requests will remain confidential.

It is the responsibility of applicants who use or require a personal care assistant for activities of daily living (e.g., personal hygiene, eating, toileting, dressing) to make their own arrangements for use of a personal care assistant when enrolled in any program at UW–Madison. As personal care assistants may have access to other minors in youth activities, screening and training requirements in alignment with youth protection practices are required. Applicants must provide sufficient advance notice to the university about their use of a personal care assistant.

#### What’s the process for communicating my child’s medical needs?

All health-related aspects of camp, including administration of medication, are handled through [University Health Services (UHS) Camp Health](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/camps/) at UW–Madison. Badger Precollege and Camp Health staff work closely together to ensure students with medical needs are receiving appropriate care. Once your child is admitted to Badger Precollege, our system will prompt all attendees to submit their health/medication information directly to Camp Health through the CampDocs system.

Summer Music Clinic

### Summer Music Clinic specifics

#### What’s the SMC experience?

SMC offers a precollege music experience open to any student interested in the world of music. Classes are taught by professional musicians in each field of study and expert educators, all organized to welcome all music and arts literacy. SMC educators and staff represent a diverse population and work together to provide music from a diverse representation of cultures and composers. Students can expect to choose from a variety of classes, experience daily wellness components for all students, daily performances by local professionals and faculty, and more.

#### Which SMC program should I sign up for?

If you are completing grades 6, 7 or 8 in the spring, you will participate in the Junior Session. If you are completing grades 9, 10, 11 or 12 in the spring, you will participate in the Senior Session.

#### Do I need to choose a single instrument/voice part to study at SMC?

No. You may choose to play or sing more than one instrument or voice part. Both the junior and senior sessions offer a variety of elective opportunities for students to choose from, in addition to options for students who are non-performance focused.

#### I’m just finishing my senior year of high school, can I still attend SMC?

Yes. We have several students each year who have completed their senior year.

#### Do I need to have a music performance focus in order to do SMC?

No. We offer performance options and non-performance tracks. SMC welcomes any student interested in pursuing their interests in music and creativity.

#### I need an instrument, can you help?

Contact us with any of your equipment needs and we can work together to get you what you need!

#### How do I know which ensemble or class I am in if there are more than one?

Students who are in band, chamber strings or winds, choir, jazz, musical theatre, orchestra, rock band, and technique classes are divided into multiple ensembles or sections in that course. Students learn which ensemble they are in the evening of the first day of SMC. Students have the choice to have a playing audition or conversation audition for their placements.

GEM Discontinuation

### Growing Early Minds (GEM) Discontinuation

#### Why discontinue the Growing Early Minds (GEM) program?

The decision to discontinue the GEM was made after careful consideration. We have experienced greater demand for programming focused on our middle-level and high school programs for students in grades 4–12 (ages 9–18), and we will be directing our time, energy and resources to ensure these programs continue at a high level.

#### Will you still offer a GEM program in winter?

No, the winter GEM program has also been discontinued.

#### What other programs are available for my students in grades 2-4?

Students who are completing grade 4 may now apply to participate in our [Precollege Academic Campus Experience (PACE)](https://precollege.wisc.edu/pace/) program for summer 2026.

#### How is the PACE program different from the GEM program?

[PACE](https://precollege.wisc.edu/pace/) is different from GEM in that it is a *full-day academic program*. As with all Badger Precollege programs, PACE helps students to become more confident and independent learners as they learn and grow in a community of curious peers and engaging instructors.

Students who participate in PACE will register for dedicated courses offered for the following grade ranges:

* Students finishing grades 4–6
* Students finishing grades 7–8

#### Is registration different for PACE programs?

Yes, registration is different. Unlike the GEM program, PACE program admissions require students to submit answers to application questions regarding their interests and learning styles, so it is helpful to review the application in advance.

#### Will staff and instructors remain the same?

There will always be some returning staff and some new faces, but our instructional philosophy remains the same. Badger Precollege will continue striving to provide high-quality instruction from qualified and engaging teachers.

#### Does this decision affect other Badger Precollege learners?

No. Our staff remains committed to creating programming that supports a broad range of academically curious and motivated learners, including international students and neurodiverse learners. We look forward to continuing to develop academic and creative programs that serve our middle-level and high school students.

#### When can I register my child for Badger Precollege programs?

Applications for all summer 2026 programs will open on January 12, 2026. We encourage you to mark this date in your calendar and prepare your application in advance.

#### Whom do I contact if I have further questions?

We’re happy to respond to your questions. Please fill out the contact form below.
