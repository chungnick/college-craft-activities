# ABOUT THE PROGRAM

[Home](https://futurescholars.rutgers.edu/) / About Overview

## A VISION FOR THE FUTURE

We believe that access to higher education changes lives and uplifts entire communities.

By offering a comprehensive pathway—from middle school exploration to college graduation—RFS is creating leaders who give back, innovate, and shape a better tomorrow.

We invite you to join us in supporting these students and helping to ensure the next 15 years are as transformative as the first.

## [RFS Program Overview](#overview)

Rutgers Future Scholars (RFS) has served as a trailblazing college-access and success initiative transforming lives and communities across New Jersey since 2008. Each year, we select 215 academically promising, first-generation middle school students from our five host cities—Camden, Newark, New Brunswick, Piscataway and Rahway—to embark on a multi-year journey toward higher education.

Thanks to robust mentoring, academic support, and a tuition assistance scholarship for those who attend Rutgers, we empower students who once believed college was out of reach.

[HOW RFS WORKS](#overview)

## Our Impact

By fostering relationships with caring mentors and providing the resources to succeed, our Scholars gain the confidence to see themselves on campus and thrive once they get there. Here are some of the Program’s remarkable outcomes. 

* **98%** of scholars graduate from high school (79% in partner districts)
* **81%** enroll in college (versus 56% in partner districts)

Research also shows a public return on investment, with every cohort of 200 RFS students projected to generate $30 million in taxpayer returns—a 4:1 ratio for every dollar spent.

## [Hope, Opportunity and Tuition Scholarship](https://futurescholars.rutgers.edu/communities/testimonials/)

We are providing hope and opportunity to our Scholars through our commitment of a full-tuition scholarship to attend Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. 

By empowering rising generations to pursue higher education and achieve life-changing success for themselves, their families and the communities in which they come from, our Scholars become college-ready, civic-minded leaders of the future.

## [RFS is a National Model Program](https://futurescholars.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RFS-Rutgers-Toolkit.pdf)

Our Scholars are prepared for success through a proven model we founded in 2008, which has inspired peer institutions of higher learning nationally to replicate RFS in their states.

## **How the Program Works**

From the summer before 8th grade through high school graduation, our scholars engage in a holistic curriculum designed to strengthen critical thinking, leadership, career exploration, and social-emotional skills.

Participants attend Saturday Academies, after-school sessions, weekend events, and intensive summer institutes that provide hands-on learning in subjects like writing, STEM, humanities, and social justice.

Upon successfully completing the pre-college phase, students who are accepted to Rutgers receive a tuition assistance scholarship (in addition to their financial aid), leaving them with zero out-of-pocket tuition costs.

Scholars also benefit from continued mentoring in college, specialized career development, and experiential learning opportunities that help them flourish academically, personally, and professionally.

# Support the Program

Rutgers Future Scholars relies on private donors, corporate partnerships, and foundations to cover the annual cost of $3,500 per scholar. Over the five-year pre-college portion, that totals $17,500 per student. An endowment of $87,500 can support one student in perpetuity, making a lasting impact on generations of future scholars.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

##### How can I apply?

Candidates are nominated by each school district. Applications are only available through your school’s guidance office.

##### How do I know if I am accepted into the program?

The Rutgers Future Scholars Program Admission Committee reviews all applications and makes all acceptance decisions. If selected, a representative will contact you. You will then receive a formal acceptance packet.

##### Is there a financial cost for me or my family if I am selected?

All RFS-supported programs are free for the Scholars. This is made possible in part by the generous support and contributions of our partnering corporations and caring individuals who believe in your potential and want to see you become successful.

##### If accepted, am I obligated to attend Rutgers University?

No, but we would very much love for you to attend Rutgers University — if you do, you will study for free. We hope you will have many options upon graduation, our main objective is to help you graduate from high school and be prepared for higher education.

##### If accepted into the Rutgers Future Scholars program, am I automatically accepted to Rutgers University?

No, however, we will help you prepare for both high school graduation and admission to college, including Rutgers.

##### If accepted, does Rutgers University pay for everything?

To be eligible for tuition scholarships, all Scholars must apply to Rutgers and be admitted. Tuition scholarships will be applied after all applicable Federal and State financial assistance awards are applied. Financial assistance for room and board (living on campus) is not guaranteed.

##### What if I graduate high school, but am not accepted to Rutgers University?

If Scholars are not admitted to Rutgers directly after graduating high school, they have the option to attend a NJ Community College through an applicable Dual Degree Program; we will then honor the tuition scholarship for the final two years of study at Rutgers University upon acceptance.

##### Once accepted, do I have to attend all Future Scholars events?

You must attend all mandatory events, which will be provided to you in advance. Additionally, we also monitor your daily attendance at school. Activities are to help you with your studies and personal growth. Please see the RFS Policy Manual regarding attendance procedures.
