#### **Design Media Arts Summer Institute**

# Create a portfolio-ready body of work in a cutting-edge design media arts department

The Department of Design Media Arts (DMA) at UCLA is one of the nation’s top design media arts department offering a comprehensive, multidisciplinary education in media creation, which fosters individual exploration and innovative thinking. Geared specifically for high school students, the department offers the DMA Summer Institute, a three-week program with morning and afternoon classes introducing design practices in the contexts of 2D Image, Net Art, 3D Worldbuilding, and Motion Graphics.

Two versions of the institute are offered: an in-person, commuter experience and a virtual/online program. These programs are identical in curriculum design, lesson objectives, and hands-on faculty guidance and support. The program is taught by professionally trained and well-experienced instructors using the most current software and technology. It culminates in a final exhibition and the creation of a portfolio-ready body of work that students may include in their college applications in related fields. It also provides students with a rare opportunity to sample college life in a cutting-edge design media arts department, while earning four units of pass/no pass UC credit.

* #### Curriculum Overview

  The DMA Summer Institute curriculum is based on materials covered in the department’s undergraduate curriculum. Each class is taught by one instructor and one program assistant; class size is limited to a maximum of 25 students.

  Students explore a variety of media examining different practices and design methods applied to the domains of 2D image, Net Art, 3D Worldbuilding, and Motion Graphics. Broadly addressing a common theme, all four classes contribute to the creation of an integrated, multi-media exhibition at the end of the program.

  + **2D IMAGE:** Students explore the enduring power of the image through a series of fun and fast-paced exercises for print and digital media. Students develop their own workflow and visual vocabulary while honing their skills in graphic design and typography. Each project integrates foundational principles of design such as form, data, composition, hierarchy, and creative intent.
  + **NET:** This course explores online networks as a medium for creative expression and artistic intervention. Through hands-on tutorials, students study the web in the traditions of interactive art, activism, and creative coding. Using techniques like collage and appropriation to reimagine the browser window, students critically engage the aesthetic and social potential of digital connectivity.
  + **WORLD:** Game engines originally developed for mass entertainment offer an exciting mode of interactive storytelling. Virtual spaces can immerse us in striking imagery and evoke complex emotions. In this course, students learn the basics of Unity and 3D modelling, while practicing "worldbuilding" as a form of visual narrative, playfulness, and participatory experience.
  + **MOTION:** From cinema and television to music videos and animation, motion is an essential property of time-based media. Students explore technical and experimental approaches to cinematography, animation, editing, and sound, gaining an understanding of video-making and motion graphics as powerful tools for storytelling and communication.

  Students typically work on their own projects which will be valuable for those who will need a portfolio for college applications, but some creative processes will be collaborative throughout the program.

---

* #### Can students bring projects that they have already been working on?

  Students will be asked to create new projects but they are welcome to bring old or ongoing projects for feedback from the course instructors and teaching assistants.

  We recommend students bring a USB flash drive with at least 256 GB storage capacity to save their projects. Students should label their flash drive with their name in case it is misplaced during the program. Other materials include a notebook, pen, and pencils for sketching and storyboarding.

  Laptops will be provided by the program for classroom use only, so students do not need to bring their own.
