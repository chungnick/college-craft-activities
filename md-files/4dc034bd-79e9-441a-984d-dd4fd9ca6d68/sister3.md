### Is there a curfew?

Yes, there is a curfew for residential students. You must be in the dorm by 11 pm during the week (Sunday through Thursday) and midnight on weekends (Friday and Saturday). You are then free to visit with friends in the common areas until 1 am during the week and 2 am on weekends.

### Am I free to leave campus?

You are allowed to leave campus during your free time as long as you are accompanied by at least one other student in the program and let your program assistant know you are leaving. Residential students must be back in the dorm before curfew or the start of any mandatory activity. You may not leave the boundaries set by the program within the city of Boston without the permission of your parents and our program. These boundaries will be reviewed with students once they arrive on campus. Our program reserves the right to restrict your access to any part of Boston for security or other concerns.

### Can I visit with my parent or guardian, relatives, or family friends in the Boston area during the program?

If a parent or guardian is in town and would like to spend time with you, that visit must be scheduled during your free time when there are no activities planned. They are welcome to visit with you anywhere within our campus boundaries.

If you would like to visit your parent or guardian, relatives, or family friends (at least 18 years of age) within city limits, that visit must be scheduled during your free time when there are no mandatory activities planned. In addition, your parent or guardian must submit a Leave Request Form. This request must be received **at least 72 hours** before you are planning to leave campus and, for weekend leave requests, before 3 pm EDT on Friday. Requests are not reviewed on nights and weekends. Your parent or guardian will need to provide details about the visit, such as the time that you will be picked up and dropped off at campus, and the cell phone number of the relative or family friend (at least 18 years of age) you will be with. You are only authorized to leave once the Summer Term Pre-College Programs office gives permission and sends your parent or guardian approval via email.

Residential students must return to the dorm by curfew.

### Is there a fee for visiting Student Health Services?

Yes, there is a $25 fee each time you visit Student Health Services and there may be additional charges for medical supplies or immunizations. These charges will be billed to your student account. Blood work is billed directly to your insurance, so please bring your insurance information.

### Can I request to room with a friend?

No, we believe that learning to live with someone new is an important part of the pre-college experience. Program activities and free time provide plenty of opportunities to hang out with friends, who will also be living in a residence hall on campus.

### I have a documented disability. How can I submit a request for accommodations?

Boston University is committed to ensuring that students with disabilities have equal access to all opportunities the University has to offer. Disability & Access Services (DAS) works to provide services and support to ensure that students are able to access and participate in the opportunities available at BU. Classroom, testing, housing, and dining accommodations may be requested through DAS. For more information, please visit the [Admitted Students]("https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/admitted-students/) section of our website.

### Who can I contact at Boston University if I have more questions?

We are happy to help you. You can find all of our information on the [Contact Us](https://www.bu.edu/summer/contact-us/) page.
