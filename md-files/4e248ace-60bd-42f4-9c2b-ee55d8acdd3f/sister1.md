Check out our [Tips to Create Your Business Idea](https://bigideasd.com/wp-content/uploads/Tips-To-Create-Your-Business-Idea-2025-1.pdf) document, [How To Video: Tips for Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQsrQHd50ug&list=PLa5FQ4tLWPngkWHRFI6srQDzdLZ_nu6sW&index=6), and all of our other resources provided on the [helpful tips](https://bigideasd.com/helpful-tips/) page.

### [How do I find out what industry my business is in?](#)

When you fill out your BIG Idea entry form, you will be asked to select an industry that best classifies your business. Please refer to the  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to find what industry your business is in. You can view the document **[here](https://www.naics.com/naics-code-description/)**. If you are still unsure, ask your advisor or take your best guess.

### [How can I make sure my work is being saved while I’m working on my project?](#)

Be sure to click “Save Draft” often while working on your project. You will be allowed a limited time period for your project to be left open on your computer before it times out. (NOTE: You will not be warned when your window is timed out.) If sharing a computer with another student, save your work and log out before the next student to log in so that your data is not overwritten. DO NOT open two browser windows to work on separate entries on the same computer.

### [What is plagiarism?](#)

BIG Idea takes plagiarism very seriously. Below are 5 examples of plagiarism as defined by Scribbr. Where the definitions below refer to ‘someone else’s words’ or “someone else’s ideas’, **keep in mind that this also includes, but is not limited to, the words or ideas generated by artificial intelligence tools.**

“Plagiarism comes in many forms, some more severe than others—from rephrasing someone’s ideas without acknowledgement to stealing a whole essay. These are the five most common types of plagiarism:

* Global plagiarism means passing off an entire text by someone else as your own work.
* Verbatim plagiarism means directly copying someone else’s words.
* Paraphrasing plagiarism means rephrasing someone else’s ideas to present them as your own.
* Patchwork plagiarism means stitching together parts of different sources to create your text.
* Self-plagiarism means recycling your own past work.”

### [What is the BIG Idea Competition’s plagiarism policy?](#)

BIG Idea reserves the right to review all entries and disqualify from the competition any entries where plagiarism is found. Applicants will be required to confirm that their entry does not include plagiarism prior to submitting their entry.  Entries identified as potential finalists will be further reviewed with appropriate plagiarism and/or AI checking tool(s).  If plagiarism is found after the competition, the following consequences can be enforced including requesting refund of prize money, rescinding scholarships with institutions, removing reference from Winner’s page or tagging as Disqualified for Plagiarism.

### [What is Academic Integrity?](#)

Academic integrity means acting in a way that is honest, fair, respectful and responsible in your studies and academic work. BIG Idea strives for participants of the competition to apply their own values to their work. Applicants are expected to be honest, fair, respectful, and responsible for their own work and to hold themselves to the highest academic standard. Examples of academic integrity could include:

* Do not assume AI responses are always correct.
* Do not plagiarize or use AI verbatim.
* Give proper credit to work that is being used.
* Do not rely on AI tools but rather be mindful and hold academic integrity.
* Using an AI tool to generate content without proper attribution qualifies as academic dishonesty.

### [Can I use AI in creating my BIG Idea entry?](#)

BIG Idea respects individual school rules regarding the use of AI. You must follow your school policy regarding the use of AI. BIG Idea will not ban the use of AI software, although competitors should be aware of potential biases in data and algorithms, as well as possible inaccurate information provided by the software. The AI tools used should be in line with the BIG Idea guidelines, to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI, promote fair competition, and uphold the integrity of BIG Idea events.

Applicants should be aware that any work produced by tools is not their own work; all use of AI software must be appropriately credited. Use of AI must not involve any form of plagiarism or unauthorized use of copyrighted materials. Failing to edit information provided by AI in the submission of your entry is considered plagiarism.

### [May I submit a business idea that I have submitted to this competition previously?](#)

Yes, in fact, we encourage it. The more feedback you can receive on your business concept, the better. However, if you were a finalist in a previous years’ BIG Idea competition, you cannot use the same business idea. You can compete with a new idea.

### [How can I make sure that I have completed everything before my final submit?](#)

The Student Checklist includes everything students need to do before submitting their final entry. Locate the checklist [**here**](https://bigideasd.com/wp-content/uploads/Student-Checklist-2025.pdf).

### [How can I make sure my work is being saved while I’m working on my project?](#)

Be sure to click “Save Draft” often while working on your project. You will be allowed a limited time period for your project to be left open on your computer before it times out. (NOTE: You will not be warned when your window is timed out.) If sharing a computer with another student, save your work and log out before the next student to log in so that your data is not overwritten. DO NOT open two browser windows to work on separate entries on the same computer.

### [What is plagiarism?](#)

BIG Idea takes plagiarism very seriously. Below are 5 examples of plagiarism as defined by Scribbr. Where the definitions below refer to ‘someone else’s words’ or “someone else’s ideas’, **keep in mind that this also includes, but is not limited to, the words or ideas generated by artificial intelligence tools.**

“Plagiarism comes in many forms, some more severe than others—from rephrasing someone’s ideas without acknowledgement to stealing a whole essay. These are the five most common types of plagiarism:

* Global plagiarism means passing off an entire text by someone else as your own work.
* Verbatim plagiarism means directly copying someone else’s words.
* Paraphrasing plagiarism means rephrasing someone else’s ideas to present them as your own.
* Patchwork plagiarism means stitching together parts of different sources to create your text.
* Self-plagiarism means recycling your own past work.”

### [What is the BIG Idea Competition’s plagiarism policy?](#)

BIG Idea reserves the right to review all entries and disqualify from the competition any entries where plagiarism is found. Applicants will be required to confirm that their entry does not include plagiarism prior to submitting their entry.  Entries identified as potential finalists will be further reviewed with appropriate plagiarism and/or AI checking tool(s).  If plagiarism is found after the competition, the following consequences can be enforced including requesting refund of prize money, rescinding scholarships with institutions, removing reference from Winner’s page or tagging as Disqualified for Plagiarism.

### [What is Academic Integrity?](#)

Academic integrity means acting in a way that is honest, fair, respectful and responsible in your studies and academic work. BIG Idea strives for participants of the competition to apply their own values to their work. Applicants are expected to be honest, fair, respectful, and responsible for their own work and to hold themselves to the highest academic standard. Examples of academic integrity could include:

* Do not assume AI responses are always correct.
* Do not plagiarize or use AI verbatim.
* Give proper credit to work that is being used.
* Do not rely on AI tools but rather be mindful and hold academic integrity.
* Using an AI tool to generate content without proper attribution qualifies as academic dishonesty.

### [Can I use AI in creating my BIG Idea entry?](#)

BIG Idea respects individual school rules regarding the use of AI. You must follow your school policy regarding the use of AI. BIG Idea will not ban the use of AI software, although competitors should be aware of potential biases in data and algorithms, as well as possible inaccurate information provided by the software. The AI tools used should be in line with the BIG Idea guidelines, to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI, promote fair competition, and uphold the integrity of BIG Idea events.

Applicants should be aware that any work produced by tools is not their own work; all use of AI software must be appropriately credited. Use of AI must not involve any form of plagiarism or unauthorized use of copyrighted materials. Failing to edit information provided by AI in the submission of your entry is considered plagiarism.

## Judging FAQ’S

### [What is the process for the BIG Idea judging?](#)

Once a judge has created an account, they are assigned entries to judge which they access through a judging website. Once an entry is chosen, the judge is presented with the student's work and a scoresheet to complete online for each entry.  There are a few questions to be scored for each section and box to provide comments.  Constructive comments are highly encouraged and key to the students' learning.  There is also a separate section for scoring the quality of the written work and sourcing.   Examples of the scoresheet, past judged entries and instructions are available at the Dashboard on the judging website.  A How-To video can also be accessed **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjqHJt763w).**

### [Why should I be a BIG Idea competition judge?](#)

Receiving over 300 entries each year, the competition relies on a large number of volunteer judges since each entry is judged by three separate people to determine the finalists. In just an hour or two, you can provide solid feedback to our high school entrants on their idea, a valuable learning experience for them.  Judges score the entry using a score card and provide comments. These scores will determine the finalists who will compete for nearly $50,000 in cash and scholarships.  To be a judge, please email your interest to kelly@growsd.org by October 25th so your judging account can be created.
