The Summer Engineering Experience (SEE) is a week-long summer experience for rising 8th through 11th graders who are interested in math and science. SEE gives students hands-on experience in different forms of engineering.

Both sessions are free for students who are selected to participate.

The 2025 schedule is as follows:

## Session 1

**Dates:**July 13 - 17, 2026

**Student grade:**Rising 8th and 9th graders

**Theme:** Making & Engineering

The focus of this session is to expose the students to different engineering disciplines and the concept of design. In addition to educational presentations throughout the week, students will complete two projects primarily utilizing items readily available in their households. The first project is a structured assignment that will be completed by the entire group throughout the week. The second is a project that will be completed individually, working within smaller groups, that allows the students to be innovative and creative. Both projects teach the students problem-solving, critical thinking, and design concepts.

## Session 2

**Dates:**July 27 - 31, 2026

**Student grade:** Rising 10th and 11th Graders

**Theme:** Biomedical Engineering

Biomedical Engineering is one of the more recent disciplines of engineering. Through academic presentations and interactive project work, students will learn about the intricacies and considerations that go into solving medical issues by applying engineering principles to biology and medicine, exploring interdisciplinary engineering concepts such as biomechanics, bioinstrumentation systems, circuit elements, stem cell and tissue engineering, robotics and 3D bioprinting.

Residential housing is NOT available during SEE. For this reason, we encourage applications from students who live within daily commuting distance of CMU’s campus. If your child is interested in submitting and application and you do not live in the area, please be aware that if your child is accepted, you are responsible for providing all housing accommodations and daily travel arrangements. All applicants must be able to commit to attending every day of the program from 9:00 am – 3:00 pm.
