# Programs

Throughout the year, Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering offers a variety of programs for K-12 students to excite them about and engage them in STEM. Our programs are designed to be interactive and fun learning experiences that provide opportunities for K-12 students to not only learn about engineering but also develop age-appropriate critical thinking, problem-solving, and design skills. All of our programs are free. We offer in-person programs, as well as offer a variety of virtual programs so that students from all over the region and beyond can participate.

For more information on K-12 STEM programs offered by the Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering, please contact the [Engineering Outreach Office](mailto:eng-outreach@andrew.cmu.edu).

## Sample outreach event: hosting Western PA School for Blind Children

Engineering Outreach hosted students from the Western PA School for Blind Children (WPSBC). Jen Hitchcock of TechSpark led the students and their chaperones on a tour of TechSpark facilities. The students were also able to examine TechSpark’s 3D printers and products that were made by the printers. Then it was on to Scott Hall where Professor Joanne Beckwith Maddock led the WPSBC students in two activities: making slime and bouncy balls. The students learned about mechanical and chemical engineering and were able to experience CMU’s campus.

> “At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes—an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new.” Carl Sagan

> “Creativity...involves the power to originate, to break away from the existing ways of looking at things, to move freely in the realm of imagination, to create and recreate worlds fully in one's mind—while supervising all this with a critical inner eye.” Oliver Sacks
