Destination: Innovation is a program designed for 5th and 6th graders to learn the engineering design process by working in teams to solve problems.

Student groups will be presented with a fictional scenario of a community with a defined set of demographics, environments, and resources.

By collaborating with Carnegie Mellon students team leaders and each other, the 5th and 6th graders will work together to find ways to apply the engineering design process to improve their fictional community.
