# Summer Camps Frequently Asked Questions

## Who's Eligible for YNS camp?

Camps are open to students entering 6th through 12th grades. See individual camps for specific eligibility or email [yns@nebraska.edu](mailto:yns@nebraska.edu).

## How do I select a YNS Camp?

Paying full or making a downpayment holds your spot for that camp. If application is opened and no payment is received within 30 days you will forfeit your spot for another camper. Payment is the only way to solidify your spot for that camp.

## When and how do I pay for camp?

All payments are accepted online through a registration system. All payments are due by June 1st. Non-refundable application fee of $30 is paid by each camper which is included in the total camp cost.

## Am I eligible for a camp scholarship?

YNS does not grant merit based scholarships. National Science Foundation provides scholarship money for students demonstrating a financial need and the scholarship does not include the camp application fee of $30. When you apply via the [YNS camps application form](/gain-hands-on-experience-in-stem/apply), mark the box indicating you wish to be considered for a Need-Based Scholarship to attend YNS camp. Your fees will be adjusted accordingly. If you have further questions, please email [yns@nebraska.edu](mailto:yns@nebraska.edu).

## What is the camp refund policy?

No refunds unless there is a catastrophic event such as medical emergency, family death, etc. that prevents the camper from attending. On that case a refund will be granted except for the non-refundable $30 application fee. Please contact the NE EPSCoR Outreach Coordinator to discuss your situation and concerns.

## How does commuting work?

Commuters will be provided a schedule prior to the start of camp. Campers will check-in prior to first scheduled activity and be picked-up after the last scheduled activity. Commuters may attend selected evening extracurricular activities (if applicable), as communicated prior to the start of camp.

## My student has some health issues requiring medications or activity modifications. Can my student attend a YNS camp?

YNS strives to work with families on an individual basis to help enable all students to attend and enjoy a YNS camp. Please contact the NE EPSCoR Outreach Coordinator to discuss your situation and concerns.

## What is the daily schedule?

Campers participate in academic activities typically from 9am to 5pm, and residential camps have scheduled extracurricular activities in the evenings after dinner. See individual camp descriptions for specifics. A complete schedule is provided at check-in.

## What does my student need to bring to camp?

Campers will participate in a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Closed-toe shoes are required in all labs. A complete list of necessary items will be provided in the camp information packet sent out prior to camp.

## What is your cell phone policy?

Cell phones and electronic devices are not permitted in lab spaces, unless lab instructors give specific instructions to do so. Nebraska EPSCoR, the host institution, and camp management and staff are not responsible for lost or stolen property while at camp.
