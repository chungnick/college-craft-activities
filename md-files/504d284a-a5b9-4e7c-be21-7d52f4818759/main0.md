# Pre-College

As high schoolers consider careers, they may not yet have been exposed to the unique blend of visual orientation, creative process, academic investigation and professional training that forms an architectural education. Students can participate in one or both sessions exploring the ideas, methods, and issues of architecture with Tulane professors and local practicing architects. Lectures, studio time, digital workshops, field trips, discussions, and critiques will be supplemented by regular design exercises to be completed outside class time.

> Explorations in Architecture and Design (formerly called Career Explorations) offers students a short, intensive and engaging introduction to architecture in two two-week sessions.

### Intended for High School Students

The program is intended for high school students who have completed at least their sophomore year. Younger students who demonstrate maturity in their attitudes and schoolwork may also apply. High school graduates may apply as well, and presently enrolled Tulane and Newcomb students may take the course for college credit.

### Summer Programs

For more information about individual sessions and to read a course description please visit the Tulane Summer Programs course page [here](https://summer.tulane.edu/courses). Class typically meets in the mornings for a lecture, film screening, or skill-building demonstration. In the afternoon, studio meets. Field trips are scheduled for Saturdays and some evenings.

### Credit Hours

At the completion of the course, high school students who pursue a degree at Tulane University will receive 3 credit hours per session (6 total). Students who pursue a degree in Architecture at Tulane may use up to 3 credit hours toward major requirements in the Bachelor of Architecture or Bachelor of Science in Architecture degree.

### Cost

Tuition is $3,495 per session and covers the full cost of instruction, activities, field trips, food, lodging and shuttle service to and from the airport. Students who choose to enroll in both sessions will receive a 10% discount.

### Materials

All required materials for the course will be supplied by the program.
