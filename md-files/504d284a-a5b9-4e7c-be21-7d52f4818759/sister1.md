### ARCH 1901: Digital Graphic Design & Typography

Graphic design is about mixing creativity + strategy to communicate visually. Images, fonts, and colors combine to tell a story, catch attention, or solve a problem. From logos to posters to app layouts, it’s art with a purpose! Typography is a big part of graphic design. The style of letters changes how we understand a message—bold letters can be powerful, curvy ones can be playful. It’s not just about reading—it’s about feeling what the words say! Also: Adobe Illustrator + Photoshop—AND THE ART OF SEEING!

What do the director of Hellboy II and the French Romantic Delacroix have in common? Fantastic sketchbooks! Just like you did from the age of two to ten years old [and perhaps further], these creative powerhouses documented their places and their thoughts in sketchbooks, extensions of their limbs, and in words, lines and washes. For these two weeks, you will be doing the same, demystifying mark and stroke, and you will leave with the capacity to articulate space and place through a two-dimensional device.
