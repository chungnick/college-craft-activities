# ITS High School Internship Program

## About the Program

The **Yale ITS High School Internship Program** aims to attract young people to the field of information technology and nurture their interest. The program offers area high school students paid opportunities to work in Information Technology Services at Yale University for eight weeks during the summer.

Created in 2013 with the collaboration of Yale Human Resources, Yale Information Technology Services, and New Haven Public Schools, the program immerses students in a professional office environment and gives them a feel for careers in technology. Working closely with managers, high school interns make real contributions to the organization and the University. The program also includes career-building workshops and events introducing the students to the campus environment.

After a summer of dedicated work and learning, the interns are encouraged to continue to explore careers related to technology as well as to spread the information they have learned among their peers.

## Qualifications

This program is focused on communities in which Yale University has a presence. Students must meet the following qualifications:

* Students must reside in New Haven, West Haven or Orange, Conn.
* Students must attend a participating high school

Interested students should speak with their teachers or guidance counselors to find out if their schools are participating in the program.

## How to Apply

Students do not apply directly to the High School Internship Program. Representatives of schools participating in the program nominate high-achieving students. ITS managers conduct interviews and match students chosen to participate with positions that match their interests and goals.

Schools seeking more information should contact [ITEarlyCareers@yale.edu](mailto:ITEarlyCareers@yale.edu).
