# Teacher Summer Research Experience (RET)

#### The ASTERIX Summer Undergraduate Research Experience for Teachers at Florida International University (2021-2025)

#### ​

Two **teachers** were selected to participate in the summer RET program at the ASTERIX Consortium. Participants will gain experience under the guidance of an established research group by investigating a topic from a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines.

Teachers will learn about cutting edge techniques and tools used in advanced sensors development and engineering, conduct a research study, and design curricular materials to use in their classroom.
