# ExciTES Summer Institute

---

ExciTES encourages rising 3rd graders through 11th graders from the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez region to use their knowledge, imagination, and creativity to 1) become aware of the diverse fields and careers of engineering and computing, and 2) be encouraged to attend college, specifically, UTEP's College of Engineering.

During any sessions in the ExciTES Summer Institute, students will meet other students of similar age while engaged in inquiry-based and team-oriented projects and activities developed by faculty and facilitated by undergraduate students. The exploration of the various engineering fields and careers will connect to the [Bachelor of Science degrees](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/academic-programs/degrees-and-programs.html) offered through the UTEP College of Engineering.

## Application Process

Students, along with their parents, can apply online to the ExciTES Summer Institute starting April 1.
