**A:** Lunch is provided for all-day sessions, but each participant may bring their own lunch if they choose. Lunch is between 12:00pm and 12:45pm.

  

**Q:** How does ExciTES and ExciTES Challenge differ?

**A:** It is our intent to have completely different modules. ExciTES Challenge will have more technical and teaming challenges incorporated into the activities.

  

**Q:** What material will be covered in ExciTES?

**A:** Concepts in the various engineering and science fields will be covered throughout the week along with college content. Popular modules include the Cardboard Canoe where participants design a canoe using concepts of buoyancy learned during the week, build a canoe that will fit two team members, and ultimately test & race the canoe at the UTEP Swimming & Fitness Center.

  

**Q:** How many different fields of engineering/science will be covered?

**A:** Each session will have a different variety of modules and each session will have at least 14 modules.

  

**Q:** Can groups with over 25 participants be accommodated?

**A:** Yes, however fees will apply. Please contact us so that we may accommodate your group's needs and interest.

  

**Q:** How and when are notifications of acceptance into the ExciTES Summer Institute sent out?

**A:** Engineering Ambassadors will contact you through email. We make every effort to notify you by email by May 15, for those registering before then or within 72 hours after we receive the application.

  

**Q:** What will participants need to do to attend the program after being accepted?

**A:** Complete all forms and submit as directed. Payments (if applicable) should not be made until the first day of any session.

  

**Q:** What should I wear?

**A:** Wear comfortable closed-toed shoes (e.g. tennis shoes). Do not wear baggy clothing, tank tops, halter tops, spaghetti straps, flip-flops as you may work with tools and equipment. Clothing should also be cool as some activities require you to be physically active or may occur outdoors at the same time it is cool in the classrooms so a light jacket or sweater is recommended.

  

**Q:** Who coordinates the various ExciTES sessions?

**A:** Engineering Ambassadors and ExciTES Interns (both undergraduate engineering and computer science majors) coordinate and facilitate a most memorable and exciting experience. Below are video introductions of these fun-filled team members.
