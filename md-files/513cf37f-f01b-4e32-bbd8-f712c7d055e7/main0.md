## How to Apply

### Eligibility Requirements

Harvard’s Pre-College Program is designed for mature, academically motivated students who are interested in exploring a potential major or simply finding out what college is really like.

Our Pre-College Program is open to rising juniors and seniors. To be eligible for Summer 2026, you must meet both of the following criteria:

* Will graduate from high school and enter college in 2027 or 2028.
* Are at least 16 years old by June 20, 2026, and will not turn 19 years old before July 31, 2026.

[Apply](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/pre-college-program/admissions/)

## Program Activities

In the Harvard Pre-College Program, you have the opportunity to choose from dozens of co-curricular activities to participate in each week. These opportunities help ensure that you have a well-rounded experience.

## The Pre-College Advantage

**Non-Credit Classes**

Test your intellect without the pressure of letter grades. Classes are non-credit, so you can take a college-level course for learning's sake.

**Small Class Sizes**

You will be challenged by Ivy League scholars as you immerse yourself in one subject in an average class size of 15 students.

**Live a Balanced (College) Life**

When class is not in session, you'll participate in creative and social activities that stimulate your mind. And take time to have fun and get to know your peers.

**Discover Your Passions**

Whether you're undecided about potential areas of study or want to take a deeper dive into a subject you love, the Pre-College Program can help you find what really excites you.

Through the experience I was able to work with a Harvard Summer School instructor as a research assistant for him and I’ve been helping him with research. It really pushed me to see what’s out there even as a teenager, not even someone in college yet, there’s so many opportunities out there for us.

## FAQs

How Long is Harvard’s Pre-College Program?

View More

Harvard’s Pre-College Program is a two-week program during which you will live on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During these two weeks, you’ll experience what it’s like to live on a college campus, attending classes every day, studying, and participating in program activities. Each summer, we offer three two-week sessions so you can find the program that fits into your summer schedule.

What Will You Get Out of a Pre-College Program?

View More

At Harvard’s Pre-College Program for high school students, you’ll build advanced academic skills to help you succeed in college, such as note-taking, keeping up with readings, and participating in class — and create amazing memories — that will last a lifetime.

You’ll learn to live independently on a college campus and experience what it’s like to be a real college student. You’ll learn how to balance homework with attending program activities and hanging out with new friends from around the world. And with hard work and diligent study, you’ll expand your knowledge in an immersive college-level class.

These experiences will not only enrich your high school years. They will set you on the path to success as you move on to your college journey.

At the end of the program, you’ll receive a written evaluation from your instructor, as well as a Harvard transcript with a grade of AR or NM (“requirements met” or “requirements not met”). This is a great way to supplement your college application.

Can You Earn College Credit Through the Pre-College Program?

View More

You will not earn college credit through the Pre-College Program.

The Pre-College Program is designed to allow you to explore the expectations of college academics without the pressure of grades. You can explore a subject you think you may want to major in, or you can explore an interesting topic just for fun.

However, **[Pre-College Program courses](https://courses.dce.harvard.edu/?srcdb=202603&summer_school=summer_school_pre_college_program) are intensive**. Each day, you will be in class for three hours, and you should expect to have 2-4 hours of homework. To successfully complete the program, you’ll have to attend and participate in every class and complete all assignments.

Do Pre-College Programs Help with College Admissions?

View More

Participation in a Pre-College Program at Harvard can help with college admissions in several important ways.

Successfully completing a pre-college program demonstrates **your ability to succeed in a rigorous college course**. It also shows admissions committees that you are a motivated and dedicated student who is willing to put in the extra effort to succeed.

Most importantly, however, our Pre-College Program is designed to **offer you tools to navigate the college admissions process successfully**.

Our college readiness activities include workshops on how to write your college admissions essay, seminars on understanding the financial aid process, and panels on how to choose the right college. We even host a series of panels with admissions officers from colleges around the country.

So when you leave the Pre-College Program, you’ll be ready to jump right into the college admissions and application process.

Previous Harvard Summer School students have gone on to attend college at institutions such as Harvard College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, New York University, Boston University, and Brown University. In fact, 20 percent of respondents to a 2024 survey reported attending an Ivy League institution after attending Harvard Summer School.
