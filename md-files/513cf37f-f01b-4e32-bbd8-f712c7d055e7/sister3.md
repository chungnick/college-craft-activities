| **Summer 2026 Session I** | **Summer 2026 Session II** | **Summer 2026 Session III** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| June 20–July 2, 2026 | July 5–July 17, 2026 | July 19–31, 2026 |

## Eligibility For 2026

The admissions committee is looking for mature, academically motivated students who meet both of the following criteria:

* Will graduate from high school and enter college in 2027 or 2028.
* Are at least 16 years old by June 20, 2026, and will not turn 19 years old before July 31, 2026.

**The account must be created, and the application must be completed, by the prospective student and not by parents/guardians, agents, counselors, or anyone else.**

**Certain email domains have historically been difficult for our automated processes to reach (ex., @qq.com, @163.com). If you primarily use one of these email addresses, we request that you use an alternative email address to complete your application and in your correspondence with Harvard Summer School.**

## How to Apply

*Keep in mind that you may only apply for one program each summer, either the Pre-College Program or the Secondary School Program.*

Complete a program application and provide supplemental materials, including:

* The $75 nonrefundable application fee
* Counselor report: You can request a link be sent to your counselor in the application
* Transcripts from 9th grade through the current term (including fall 2025 grades): This can include progress reports, report cards, and educational summaries from your high school.
* Rules and Media Release online form: You can request a link be sent to your parent or legal guardian in the application
* If English is not your native language, submit scores from the [TOEFL iBT](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt.html), [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/en-us), or Duolingo language proficiency exam along with your application.

See the [Pre-College Calendar](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/pre-college-program/program-calendar/) for all important dates and deadlines.

### Application Tips

* **No fee is required to start your application.** You will be asked to pay the nonrefundable application fee only upon submitting the application.
* **Review expectations for TOEFL, IELTS, and Duolingo Academic tests (non-native English speakers only).**Successful students typically score above 103 on the TOEFL with a 25 or above on the writing section (or overall score of 5 with new grading system), 7.5 or above on the IELTS with a 7.0 or above on the writing section, and 135 or above on Duolingo. We do not accept Cambridge English Exam or TOEFL iTP test scores. Be sure to schedule your test appointment as early as possible, so that the test does not delay your application. You can also submit an interview and writing sample from InitialView to supplement your application, but these cannot replace the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo scores.
* **When you apply, choose your program thoughtfully.** You may apply to only one of Harvard Summer School’s college programs for high school students per year.
* **Use a desktop or laptop when completing your application.**You will be asked to write short essays as part of your application. This may be challenging to do on a mobile phone. Therefore, we advise using a desktop or laptop computer to complete your application.
* **Watch your inbox** — you’ll receive an email prompting you to log in to check your application status after you’ve completed your application.

Admissions decisions are only valid for the summer term in which you apply. You may not defer admission to the program to a subsequent summer term.

## Selection Process

We will evaluate all information submitted — including transcripts, current grades, counselor reports, and your short essays — when considering your application.

Harvard Summer School does not discriminate against applicants or students on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry or any other protected classification.

## International Students

According to [U.S. State Department guidelines](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html), international students participating in the Pre-College Program do not qualify for F-1 student visas as this is a non-degree program that requires less than 18 hours per week in the classroom.

Participants should apply for the B-2 tourist visa (citizens of some countries may not need visa stamps but will need pre-approval through the [ESTA system](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)) which allows for brief stays — usually less than six months — that may include participation in a short recreational course of study, not for credit toward a degree.

*Consult the U.S. embassy or consulate in your country if you have any questions about visas, country-specific policies, or the necessary documentation for your visit.*

Please visit the [U.S. Embassy](http://www.usembassy.gov/) website to locate the embassy in your country.
