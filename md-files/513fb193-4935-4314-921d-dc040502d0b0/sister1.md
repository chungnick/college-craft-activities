# USA Biolympiad

Image

[USABO Portal](https://www.usabo-trc.org/)

As the premier biology competition for high school students in the United States, the USA Biolympiad (USABO) enriches the life science education of nearly 12,000 talented students annually. The USABO is open to EVERY school in the USA. It provides your students with the motivation, curricular resources, and skills training to take them beyond their classroom experience to the level of international competitiveness. After two rounds of challenging exams, twenty Finalists are invited to a residential training program where they learn advanced biological concepts and exacting lab skills at the USABO National Finals. Ultimately, four students earn the right to represent the United States as the USA Biolympiad Team at the International Biology Olympiad (IBO), a worldwide competition involving student teams from over seventy countries.

Bio-magic happening at USABO

### How successful is the USA Biolympiad Team?

At the 2025 National Finals, Eric Liu, Cloris Shi, Ferris Li, and Kian Dhawan earned the right to represent the USA at the 2025 International Biology Olympiad (IBO) in Quezon City, Philippines, where they received 3 gold medals and one silver. Since CEE began administering the USABO in 2003, every member of the USA Biolympiad Team has medaled at the IBO! All four members of the team were awarded gold medals in years 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2024. The team also achieved the coveted Number 1 position in the world in 2007, 2011, 2013, and 2024 as well as the Number 1 student in the world in 2013 and 2023.  The 2026 International Biology Olympiad will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania in July 2026.
