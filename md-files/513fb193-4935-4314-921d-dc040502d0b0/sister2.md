## RSI Application FAQs

Please visit the RSI home page: <https://www.cee.org/programs/apply-rsi>

If you need to contact someone, please contact RSI program staff as indicated on the contact list, <https://www.cee.org/contact-us>.

### Eligibility

* **Who is eligible to apply for RSI?**

  RSI is open to high school students who have one year remaining before graduation. Students apply during their junior year of high school (11th grade). High school seniors are **not** eligible. Applicants must be 16 years of age by July 1 of the program year.

  Public, private and homeschool students are eligible to apply to RSI.

  U.S. citizens and permanent residents, as well as international students from participating countries, can apply. Internationals students please check with Maite Ballestero, Executive Vice President, Programs ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2654554f6645434308495441)) to learn if your country is participating.
* **What are the characteristics of students that RSI is seeking?**

  RSI students are selected based on their potential as future leaders in STEM. RSI students typically demonstrate superior academic achievement in math and science and a genuine passion for research. RSI students have taken rigorous STEM courses and participated in extracurricular activities like science competitions or independent research projects.
* **How important is prior research experience?**

  While prior research experience is helpful and can make your application stronger, it is not required. About 10% of RSI students do not have prior research experience. Students can show their passion and curiosity for scientific inquiry in their essays. It is important to demonstrate some sort of foundation in a field, such as classes or other experience, even if there is no prior research experience. Students whose research interests are purely aspirational are less likely to be selected.
* **What do you suggest for students who do not have much research experience?**

  Read research papers or articles in the areas that interest you and look at research websites to learn about what is being done at different labs. Ask friends about what they are doing; speak with your teachers or family about your interests.

  Demonstrate your curiosity and passion for a subject through your essays. Write about a specific topic that fascinates you, a challenging problem you have tried to solve, or a time you went beyond your school curriculum to learn something new. Show do not just tell: Give concrete examples of your self-motivated learning. For instance, describe a personal project you undertook, a difficult book you read, or an online course you completed that is related to your scientific interests. You can write about your participation in a school science or math club, a science fair, or even a part-time job.

  If you live in a STEM desert, mention this in your application. The RSI selection committee considers students in the context of the opportunities that are available to them.

### Application Process

* **When is the application deadline?**

  The application deadline is at 11:59 pm ET in early- to **mid-December**, typically on Wednesday of the second full week in December.

  It is best to submit your application at least a few days before the deadline. Do not wait until the last minute to submit your application. **Late applications are not considered**, regardless of the reason.
* **When are applicants notified of their status?**

  All applicants are notified of their admission status at the same time in **March**. There is no rolling admission for the program.
* **What are the key components of the application?**

  The application requires a completed online form, **essay responses** to questions about your STEM goals, **three letters of recommendation** from a math and science teacher, a research supervisor (if you worked with someone) or an endorsement from a person who can attest to your leadership.. In addition, your official high school transcript, standardized test scores, and a listing of honors and awards are required.

  It is wise to provide complete responses to the essay questions and to make sure you have provided all the requested information.

  You will add the names of the **recommenders** and the **school official** who will upload your transcript in **Section IV,** Transcript Upload and Recommendation Form. The registrar or school counselor is the **4th** slot in the section. You can add your test scores in the standardized scores section.
* **Are standardized test scores required?**

  Yes, all U.S. students are **required** to submit scores from the PSAT, SAT or ACT if they can take these tests.

  International students can share scores related to their countries if they cannot take the PSAT, SAT or ACT.

  While recommended scores can be quite high (e.g., PSAT Math 740+, SAT Math 750+, ACT Math 33+), the selection committee reviews applications holistically, so strong essays and recommendations and prior research experience can help compensate for slightly lower scores.
* **What type of background in STEM do students have when applying? Any tips before applying?**

  Students typically have taken the most rigorous STEM courses available to them in school and pursue activities and opportunities outside of school. Most students are leaders and are also giving back to their local community.
* **Is there an application fee?**

  Yes, there is a non-refundable application fee of $75.
* **Can I get the application fee waived?**

  Application fee waivers may be available to students with demonstrated financial need. Contact the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) directly to ask about the possibility of a fee waiver.
* **How competitive is the program?**

  RSI is very selective. The program receives over 2,500 U.S. applications and 600 international applications each year and accepts less than 2.5% of applicants.
* **What if my teachers or counselors do not receive the email from Slideroom?**

  The application system, Slideroom, sends emails to your recommenders and school officials. If they do not receive the email, they should contact Slideroom's support directly. You should also ensure you have entered their email addresses correctly in the application.
* **Will RSI accept applications from international students this year? If so, which countries? Do international students have a different application deadline?**

  RSI will accept international students. The specific countries depend on the sponsors working with CEE. If you are an international student, please contact Maite Ballestero, Executive VP of Programs, and she can let you know which countries are likely to sponsor students this year. The deadline for applications from international students is the same as for U.S. students unless there is a different process for a particular country.

### Program Details

* **What is the duration of the RSI program?**

  The program lasts for six weeks during the summer.
* **Where is RSI held?**

  The program is held in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
* **How much does RSI cost?**

  RSI is cost-free for all participants. All educational, housing and dining expenses are covered.
* **What are the key components of the RSI program?**

  RSI begins with a week of intensive STEM classes taught by accomplished professors. This is followed by a five-week research internship, where the students conduct individual research projects under the guidance of mentors who are experienced scientists and researchers. The program culminates in writing a research paper and giving a presentation at the RSI Symposium.

### Mentorship and Research

* **How are mentors and research projects assigned?**

  Mentors and projects are assigned based on a student's interests and background, as indicated in their application. Students are matched with a mentor who is a professor, scientist, or researcher in a relevant field.

  Students do not get to bring a research project of their choice to RSI. Continuation of a previous research project is not permitted.
* **Do you have to have a specific question or research idea in mind to apply?**

  No, you just share your passion for what you want to do! If selected, mentors work with students on a research topic.
* **What kind of research can I expect to do?**

  Students work on individual research projects in various STEM fields, including mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, computer science, robotics, and engineering. The projects are designed to be challenging and provide a genuine research experience.

### After the Application

* **When will I hear about my application status?**

  Notifications for acceptance are typically sent out in the spring, typically March.
* **Can I receive feedback on my application if I am not accepted?**

  Due to the high volume of applications, the program is unable to provide individual feedback.

### After RSI

* **How does the support program work after RSI? For example, if you wanted to reach out to a colleague, can you just email them and get in contact?**

  Typically, RSI students will ask Maite Ballestero, Executive VP of Programs, to recommend alumni to speak with in their research area. She will make introductions by email. RSI has a lively and engaged alumni community and there are alumni groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram for alumni to follow CEE and post information or ask questions.
* **In what other ways does RSI support its alumni?**

  The RSI Director writes college letters of recommendation for all the RSI students.

  RSI has a global network of over 3,000 alumni. This network is a valuable resource for career advice, mentorship, and professional connections. Many alumni hold leadership positions in academia, industry, and government.

  There is a critical mass of alumni at various colleges and universities, especially in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Washington, DC.

  RSI organizes virtual reunions for alumni by year and by research interests. There is an in-person reunion for all alumni every five years. There are also regional meetups, online webinars, trips, and other programs for alumni.

  Many RSI alumni return to the program as staff, counselors, tutors, nobodies, and guest speakers, reinforcing the sense of community and providing guidance to the next generation of students.
