# Democracy Scholars

## Discover Passions. Discuss Big Ideas. Prepare for College. Make Friends for Life.

NYU Democracy Scholars offers rising high school seniors in New York City a FREE residential opportunity to learn in a college environment, explore relevant topics in political philosophy and social justice, and develop confidence in their academic and leadership capabilities. Students reside at NYU's campus from July 6 - 26, and continue to meet as Democracy Scholars throughout the duration of their senior year of high school to work on civic engagement projects.

Over the summer, students participate in small discussion-based seminars led by NYU professors and gain experience in college-level reading, writing and critical thinking. Additionally, students receive mentoring and support throughout the college application process from professors and Democracy Scholar Writing Mentors. Preference for the Democracy Scholars program will be given to first generation student applicants attending public high school. Only NYC residents are eligible to apply for NYU Democracy Scholars at this time.

## Application Checklist

* We look for diversity in our cohort, including students from different countries and immigrant backgrounds. This information will remain confidential:

  + Your parents/guardians' highest level of education

#### 2. Attachments

* **Academic Transcript:**You can submit an unofficial transcript by uploading it to the “Academic History” page of your application or to your applicant portal after submission. Alternatively, you can have your high school counselor or school representative submit an official transcript by email to admissions.docs@nyu.edu.
* **Email Address of One Letter Recommender:** You will need to provide the email address of at least one person who can write a confidential letter of recommendation speaking to your intellectual curiosity, ability to work hard, commitment to academic growth and/or leadership capabilities. This could be a teacher, guidance counselor, principal, coach, religious/civic mentor, or professional leader.

#### 3. Long Answer Questions

You will be asked to answer each of the following questions in approximately 200-500 words:

* What is an issue you have a burning desire to know more about? Why?
* Choose **one** of the following texts and reflect on the extent to which you agree or disagree:
  1. "Where there is no common power, there is no law, where no law, no injustice. Force, and fraud, are in war the cardinal virtues. No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." - Hobbes, 1651
  2. “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” - Margaret Mead, 1978

**The Democracy Scholars Program must take the unfortunate step of pausing for Summer 2025 and the academic year. We hope to offer the program again the following year. Stay tuned for more updates!**

Summer 2025

## Summer 2025

#### Schedule

Students attend the summer residential program for three weeks from July 6 - 26, and may not be excused except for essential medical appointments. A typical day will include a morning seminar session led by NYU professors, an afternoon study session led by graduate student Democracy Writing Mentors, as well as any interactive activities and/or field trips. A sample daily schedule from 2024 is outlined below, and a more detailed itinerary will be provided upon program acceptance.

#### Dorms

Students will reside in Weinstein Hall from July 6 - 26. While the dorm is co-ed, students are assigned to single-gender, multi-bedroom suites where they share a common space and bathroom. 4 to 6 students live in each suite, but rooms are shared between 2 students.

#### COVID-19

Democracy Scholars will be offered in-person for summer 2025; however, we must remain flexible in our response to developments related to COVID-19. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff is our first priority. If we are unable to conduct the program on campus as planned, we will shift to remote instruction. Any changes to program format will be communicated promptly if and when they are confirmed.

COVID-19 Safety Requirements

## COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS & SAFETY MEASURES

**In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NYU has in place ongoing public health measures and requirements to ensure the safety of all University community members. As enrolled students in a summer program, all Democracy Scholar students coming to campus in person or participating in any in-person University-sponsored activities (whether on or off campus) must adhere to University guidelines and policies. Below are highlights of these policies as of February 2023.  More information, including updates as the pandemic evolves, can be found on the** [**NYU COVID-19 Information**](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information.html) **website.  Students will also receive COVID-19-related information via NYU email and at their program orientation.**

**Vaccination Requirement**

All students are required to be [fully vaccinated and boosted](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/covid-19-vaccine.html) with an FDA-authorized or WHO-listed vaccine and must [upload vaccination records](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-questions-and-support/proof-of-vaccination-upload-instructions.html) to the NYU Student Health Center portal before the start of their program.  Students who are not compliant with the vaccination requirement will not have access to campus buildings, facilities, or NYU-sponsored activities (both on and off campus), and may be de-enrolled from their program or face [other serious consequences](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/next-stop-health-requirements/immunization-requirements.html#compliance).

Students participating in an online program who will not be on campus in person or participate in any in-person University-sponsored activities (such as internships, practicums, field placements, immersion experiences, field trips, and events) at any time during the summer do not need to submit proof of vaccination.

Students may [request an exemption](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-requirement.html#exemption) from the vaccination requirement for medical or religious reasons. Review of exemption requests takes approximately ten business days, so please submit your request with adequate time for review before the start of a program.

**Other COVID-19 Protocols**

As of February 2023, there are a few protocols in place for the health and safety of the community.  These include the [Violet Go Pass](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/violet-go.html) to enter any campus building or University-sponsored activity, [optional masking](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/protective-equipment.html), and [reporting positive cases](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/symptoms-of-covid-19.html) and [isolating at home if ill or testing positive for COVID-19](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/symptoms-of-covid-19.html).  Up-to-date information on University campus health protocols can be found on the [NYU COVID-19 Information](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information.html) website.
