Ohio State is in the process of revising websites and program materials to accurately reflect compliance with the law. While this work occurs, language referencing protected class status or other activities prohibited by Ohio Senate Bill 1 may still appear in some places. However, all programs and activities are being administered in compliance with federal and state law.

# Department summer programming

Spend the summer with the College Arts and Sciences. The college offers a wide variety of campus programs for students of all ages. See below for some offerings from our departments.

## High school camp about philosophy and artificial intelligence

The first session of the [Philosophy and Critical Thinking (PACT) Summer Camp](https://philosophy.osu.edu/pact  ) for high school students will focus on Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence in summer 2024. We explore questions like: Can computer systems be intelligent or conscious? How can AI perpetuate bias and other forms of injustice? Does the potential for super-intelligent AI systems pose an existential threat to humanity?

## **Immersive experience in art education**

[This program](https://aaep.osu.edu/events/immersive-experience-art-education) offers high school students in grades 9-11 who are starting to think of where they'd like to go to college an opportunity to have a first glance at what it means to be in art education at Ohio State. This day-long program on June 10 offers opportunities for meaningful and insightful engagement with art education faculty, students and curriculum. The high school juniors who attend will also have a chance to learn about admissions, financial aid, scholarships, study abroad opportunities and other resources that are available at the university. 

## **Summer Linguistic Institute for Youth Scholars (SLIYS)**

The [Summer Linguistic Institute for Youth Scholars (SLIYS)](https://linguistics.osu.edu/undergrad/sliys) is a one- or two-week online summer program for high school students organized by the Department of Linguistics. SLIYS introduces students with an interest in foreign languages to the scientific study of language. Participants will explore how language works on many levels, as well as gain insight into the ways in which individual languages are similar to and different from each other. 

## **Humanities and Cognitive Sciences Summer Institute**

The annual [Humanities and Cognitive Sciences High School Summer Institute](https://cog.osu.edu/programs/humcog ) is a week-long summer camp that provides a critical thinking forum for high school students to explore the big questions at the intersection of the humanities and cognitive sciences. High school scholars will spend the mornings with world-renowned professors in lectures and afternoons in group discussions and hands-on activities. They'll get a glimpse of what it's like to be a university student while cultivating their passions and building a community of like-minded peers. 

## **Young Writers Workshop**

This is a week-long [summer program](https://english.osu.edu/grad/mfa/young-writers-workshop ) for high school students in Columbus City Schools, charter schools in the city of Columbus, and (this year, and possibly beyond) students in public schools across Ohio. Students live on campus and attend daily workshops and courses taught by Ohio State Department of English creative writing faculty, alumni of our graduate MFA program, and current MFA students. There are also readings, sessions with visiting writers in various fields, and other events, including an open mic reading of the participants’ own work, and (of course!) time for their own writing every day. 

## **Youth Summer Music Programs**

Each summer, the School of Music welcome hundreds of student musicians to campus where they participate in [programs](https://music.osu.edu/outreach/ysmp2024 ) specifically designed to further their skills, understanding of — and love for — music. Faculty craft diverse and rich activities that provide each student with a meaningful musical experience.

## **Ohio State Dance Summer Intensive for High School Students**

The [Ohio State Dance Summer Intensive](https://dance.osu.edu/prospective-students/ohio-state-dance-summer-intensive-high-school-students) is a one-week immersive dance experience. The Ohio State University Department of Dance is offering a daytime non-residential dance intensive for rising high school students entering grades 9-12 next autumn. The intensive will include five days of classes in movement practice, repertory and choreography, with additional sessions about dance in college.
