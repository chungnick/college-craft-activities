## Frequently asked questions

### Does the program cover travel?

Click to expand

SVB does not cover any travel costs, and it is the responsibility of the participant’s family to plan their travel to and from the University of Kansas.

### What should my student pack?

Click to expand

SVB participants spend majority of the day in Capitol Federal Hall, and it can get cold in the building, so be mindful to bring what you need to be comfortable and attentive during the day.

Temperatures in Kansas during June average between 80-90 degrees. Participants will be expected to walk campus to travel between buildings.

Linens, blankets and towels will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you would prefer. Participants are not required to bring any electronic devices (laptops, tablets, etc.) and if you do bring any of these items, you are encouraged to keep them locked in your residence hall room.

Suggested items to pack:

* Toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, sunscreen, etc.)
* Phone/phone charger
* Weather appropriate attire (shorts, T-shirts, light jacket, etc.)
* Jacket/sweatshirt to have in Capitol Federal Hall
* Comfortable shoes for walking
* Closed-toe, closed-heel shoes for industry tour
* Umbrella/rain jacket
* Medications (as necessary)

### Is there a cost associated with this program?

Click to expand

All students invited to attend will owe a $50 participation fee. Students who qualify for a need-based waiver will not have to pay that participation fee.

### Where will my student stay during the program? Do they need money to eat during the program?

Click to expand

All participants will be housed in a university residence hall located on KU's beautiful campus and near the School of Business. Students will be paired with a roommate of the same gender and live on the same floor of the residence hall with on-site housing staff.

Participants will eat at a campus dining facility close to their residence hall. Because students will walk between program sessions, comfortable shoes are recommended.
