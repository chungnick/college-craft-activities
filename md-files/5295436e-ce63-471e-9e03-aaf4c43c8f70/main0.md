# Medical Research: Clinical Trials Resulting in Medical Discoveries

Every vaccine, drug, and treatment used in medicine is the result of evidence-based research. For a cancer therapy to succeed, medical researchers have to ask a question. Will it work? In this course you will learn the process researchers use to formulate, conduct, and evaluate the evidence they gather. You will be tasked with developing your own study using professional methods. For any high schooler thinking about a future in STEM, medical research, pharmaceuticals or medical school, this course is for you.

## What Our Students Are Saying

> "I would recommend this course, especially as a freshman in high school because this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I was able to expand my knowledge and understanding of the world of medicine just in two weeks. I was able to learn how patient-doctor interaction is just as important as working in the lab. I was informed about clinical research and even the FDA. I also discovered there is a role to determine whether something is moral or not in the world of medicine. This was such an amazing turning point for me!"

Mane, medical research student from Calif.

> "I would highly recommend this course as it gives an extensive and clear overview of the medical research community. It explores career paths, how to conduct research, and the impact medical research has on the advancements of medicine."

Noelle, medical research student from N.J.
