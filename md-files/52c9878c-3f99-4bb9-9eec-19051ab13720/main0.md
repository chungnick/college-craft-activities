### What is RISE?

RISE is a 10-week summer research program designed for UCR continuing students and incoming UCR transfer students. Participants work under the supervision of a faculty mentor on a cutting-edge research project. The program features faculty mentoring, professional development opportunities, immersive experience in the UCR science community, and an undergraduate symposium. Through support from generous donors and institutional financial commitments to undergraduate research, the College of Natural & Agricultural Sciences pays CNAS undergraduate students in the Learning Communities CNAS Scholars program (continuing students, [CNAS Scholars](http://cnasscholars.ucr.edu/ "CNAS Scholars")) and the Summer Bridge to Research program (incoming transfer students, [CNAS Transfer Connections](https://stem.ucr.edu/ "CNAS Transfer Connections ")). This paid summer undergraduate research opportunity is hosted by CNAS and collaborates with different on-campus partners.

### Primary Objectives

### **RISE primary objectives are:**

1. #### **Shaping undergraduate students' research and professional identity.**
2. #### **Enhancing scientific communication and literacy.**
3. #### **Attaining foundational research skills and knowledge.**
4. #### **Developing a sense of belonging within UC Riverside.**
