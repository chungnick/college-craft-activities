### **RISE (Research in Science and Engineering)**

Participants work under the supervision of a faculty mentor on a cutting-edge research project. The program features faculty mentoring, professional development opportunities, immersive experience in the UCR science community, and an undergraduate symposium.

Through support from generous donors and institutional financial commitments to undergraduate research, the College of Natural & Agricultural Sciences pays CNAS undergraduate students in the Learning Communities CNAS Scholars program (continuing students, CNAS Scholars), and the Summer Bridge to Research program (incoming transfer students) a **$5,000 stipend** for the *10-week program*. This paid summer undergraduate research opportunity is hosted by CNAS and collaborates with different on-campus partners. The application will **re-open late-Winter 2025.**

RISE aims to increase the number of outstanding students from diverse backgrounds to become acquainted with one of the most essential traits of a scientific career: **research**.

It's primary objectives are:

1. *Shaping undergraduate students' research and professional identity.*
2. *Enhancing scientific communication and literacy.*
3. *Attaining foundational research skills & knowledge.*
4. *Developing a sense of belonging within UC Riverside.*

Participating in RISE clarified the connection between science and technology. It allowed me to see that inventing a new device or developing modern medicines starts in a laboratory setting. Being in this program made me realize that research is a continuous process of learning, which in itself is exciting. This, I believe, can help students embrace the world of research.

Tristan Carlo Rojo

Physics Major

Participating in RISE changed my perspective on research. I discovered many job opportunities in the research field and it changed my perspective on what research entails.

Lana Kamel

Neuroscience Major

I will take the knowledge I gained from RISE to further my professional career.

Satya Dhiresh Bandaru

Neuroscience Major

Research in RISE provides students with a unique and invaluable opportunity to gain in-lab experience while witnessing fascinating biological processes. Through my time in RISE, I was able to both nurture my passion for life sciences and learn from incredible researchers.

## CNAS Scholars

Students that successfully complete the *CNAS Learning Community program* or stay enrolled from Fall to Spring are encouraged to apply as a RISE CNAS Scholar for the summer following their first year. We will select students based on the general summer RISE application which will **reopen late-Winter 2025**. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.

RISE CNAS Scholars can find a list of faculty participating in RISE on the [https://rise.ucr.edu/programs/student-research-opportunities-summer](https://rise.ucr.edu/programs/student-research-opportunities-summer  "Student Research Summer Opportunities") page and reach out to faculty members they are interested in to express their desire to join their research lab for the internship. The application will inquire you to upload a *personal essay, transcript, resume, and a reference (no recommendation letter required)*. If accepted, students will complete professional development workshops and an engaging research project under the supervision of a CNAS faculty. RISE participants are funded with a **stipend of $5,000** over the summer. Topics vary and depend upon the discipline of your chosen faculty mentor.

For questions on this program & the application process, please contact [noelgras@ucr.edu](mailto:noelgras@ucr.edu).

## DG Scholars

Dynamic Genome Summer Scholars are first-year *students who have completed BIOL020*. In order to apply, the applicant must have taken BIOL020 because the majority of their experience will be an extension of BIOL020 coursework. If accepted, students will be placed into groups and taught how to manage their own research projects. A select group of participants will be assigned to a chosen faculty lab rather than a small group. Scholars will learn many beneficial techniques to assist them in locating lab positions post-RISE.

If you would like additional information on the program, please watch the video below. Or, feel free to contact the program coordinator **Dr. James Burnette** at [james.burnette@ucr.edu](mailto:james.burnette@ucr.edu).
