# Admissions

Applications from students who are first generation college and/or reside in a designated low-income and health professional shortage area, to the Schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine are reviewed by the Admissions Committee using the same criteria applied to all applications. Candidates for admission receive a full review and are selected on a competitive basis. Candidates invited for an interview meet with the associate dean, associate director, and/or assistant directors of the Health Career Opportunity Programs office, and medical or dental students who answer questions in an informal setting. The associate dean, associate director, and assistant directors are members of the Admissions Committee. Students also act as hosts for medical and dental school applicants.
