# Summer Academy for Math and Science

### Providing opportunities for students underrepresented in STEM-related fields.

## Program Overview

For over twenty-five years, the Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS) program has engaged students in a rigorous curriculum taught by faculty and staff who are deeply committed to student success. Led by the [Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion](https://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity/), SAMS allows students to develop a deeper understanding of STEM via traditional classroom instruction, through hands-on projects, and sustained engagement with world-renowned faculty and skilled staff mentors. In addition to their academic experiences, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and develop meaningful relationships with peers from across the country.  
  
 Through SAMS and other outreach initiatives, the university:

* **Develops**a diverse and supportive community of STEM Scholars interested in attending top-tier universities.
* **Strengthens**students’ commitment to pursuing STEM-related disciplines.
* **Broadens**students understanding and access to opportunities made available through study in STEM.
* **Equips**students with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to be successful STEM scholars.

## Curriculum

**The Summer Academy for Math and Science will consist of 3 parts:**

**PART 1:** Part one of the SAMS program occurs prior to the start of the residential program. This is a **required virtual Jumpstart** for participants, focusing on skill-building that is needed for the in-person program. We will be connecting virtually for portions of both June 15 & June 16, 2026, however students will not be needed for full days.

**PART 2:**Part two of the SAMS program is a 6-week, in-person, Pre-College program. SAMS Scholars will be in courses and meetings for full days during the time they are here. The academic portion of the program will conclude with the research symposium on the final Friday of the program.  Scholars are responsible for their travel to and from Pittsburgh. 

## Academic Experience

* Students will complete Quantitative and Computational Skill seminars that compose the academic core:

  + Math
  + Science
  + STEM-related research project that is advised by a STEM faculty and/or graduate student
* Students will participate in weekly writing workshops with a focus on college application preparation.
* Students will successfully complete “Student to Scholar,” which is a credit-bearing course designed to help students better understand who they are, who they want to be, and learn what it takes to get there. This research-based course assists students as they prepare for their transition from high school to college.
* Students will attend workshops led by alumni, students, university leaders, and local industry leaders. Topics include STEM-related research, career exploration, and presentations on college admission and financial aid.
* Students will meet in mentoring small groups facilitated by the Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion professional staff and/or campus partners.
* Students will apply collaborative learning strategies by engaging in group tutoring and academic coaching offered through the Student Academic Success Center.

## SAMS Research Symposium

* Students will showcase their STEM projects and celebrate their achievements at the Research Symposium. This capstone event includes student presentations and an awards ceremony, with options for families and caregivers to attend either in person or virtually.

## Testimonials

I learned so much during my SAMS experience, and I feel like it will really help me move forward as an educated scholar. ~Participant, SAMS 2025

I really enjoyed learning new things with a supportive environment and amazing group of people. ~Participant, SAMS 2025

I really enjoyed the community at SAMS. Although it is cliche to say, I really felt like I met people who I really connected with and felt supported by. I think I will forever remember the people here at SAMS as the first time I have felt like I was in a true community of people who had the same passion and support for others. ~Participant, SAMS 2025

I liked connecting with so many different people and seeing the paths that people took to get where they are and how unique and diverse their experiences were. ~Participant, SAMS 2025

**PART 3:** Part three of the SAMS program involves Sustaining Connections & Engagement Experiences.These connections will be ongoing and virtual.

* Students will have the opportunity to participate in on-going virtual enrichment sessions, such as FAFSA, college prep, budgeting, and info sessions on additional development opportunities. Families and caregivers will be invited to attend relevant sessions.
* Students will interact with current Carnegie Mellon community members to explore STEM majors and opportunities at CMU.

SAMS is a fully funded, merit-based program. There is no cost for scholars to participate beyond their travel to and from Pittsburgh, PA. We expect all SAMS Scholars to participate fully for the duration of the program. We understand that students may be applying to multiple summer opportunities, however if selected for SAMS, scholars will not be permitted to participate in any other programs (virtual or in person) if program dates conflict. If you have any questions, please reach out to [cmu-sams@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:cmu-sams@andrew.cmu.edu).

# Course Highlights

### **Math**

Alumnus, Dr. Michael Young, earning a M.S. and Ph.D in mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, serves as Associate Professor and Mellon College of Science Associate Dean of Community Engagement. He contributes to a number of summer and pre-college programs focused on advancing STEM.

Dr. Young, who has taught courses, such as, *Introduction to Game Theory*, makes it his mission to encourage attitudes of enthusiasm towards mathematics. 

In introduction to Game Theory, scholars learn a field of mathematics and economics that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers, and scholars learn how to model and analyze situations where individuals or groups make decisions that affect one another. Through a combination of theoretical concepts and practical applications, students explore how these choices can be analyzed and predicted.

In 2024, Dr. Young was named one of *New Pittsburgh Courier’s* Men of Excellence, an annual award honoring men in the Pittsburgh region who are making meaningful contributions to their communities and leading by example. Dr. Young leads the Mellon College of Science Summer Scholars Program, co-developed the Data Analytics for Science Immersion Experience, and serves as a mentor for Tartan Scholars.

*Dr. Michael Young*

According to SAMS’ scholars:

*Through SAMS and this summer, my previous love of mathematics has grown further. While I saw it as a sort of task and chore before, through the Game Theory course I’ve learned that mathematics is fun, sort of like, well a game.*~SAMS 2025 Scholar

*Being able to challenge myself and stay motivated was a special feeling and to be able to share that with my friends was a great thing to experience. I am so grateful for the opportunity to meet so many like-minded peers, and many great mentors…**~*SAMS 2025 Scholar

### **Biology**

**Biology** class in SAMS offers a series of experiments allowing students to explore areas of modern research in biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology. Techniques of DNA isolation (for applications in forensic science), protein analysis (from blood diseases), and Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (by transforming glow-in-the-dark bacteria from jellyfish) substantiates the course’s goal of helping students decide what they may want to study in college.

Dr. Carrie Doonan, Teaching Professor and Director of Undergraduate Laboratories, Biology

### **From Student to Scholar 99106: College Transition Course**

Who are you? What do you want to be in college and beyond? In 2024, SAMS introduced a college credit course grounded in these questions.

The **From Student to Scholar: College Transition Course**, is based on research in psychology, behavioral decision-making, and learning science. Through readings, podcasts, in-class lectures and discussions, students learn about theories of the self, including identity development, self-determination, self-regulated learning, and self-authorship. Each of these theories aligns with the key goals of the class: *to better understand who you are, decide who you want to be, and learn what it takes to get there.* Together, students and course instructor, Dr. Kevin Jarbo, *A*ssistant Professor of Social and Decision Sciences, navigate the question: “How do I get from the student I am today to the scholar I’m going to be in the future?"

### Chemistry

The SAMS **Chemistry** course overviews keystone analytical techniques used in research labs around the world: spectroscopy, chromatography, titrations, and more. It utilizes modern analytical instruments  - the UV-Visible and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry and the High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph - to collect and analyze real data. By learning the theoretical underpinning of these techniques, students leave this course understanding what the quantum world can teach us about the world we see and touch. Students gain an understanding of the theory and the process of experimental design, improve problem solving and analytical skills, as well as technical communication skills.

Dr. Gizelle Sherwood, Teaching Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies, Chemistry

### **Writing**

**Writing the College Application Essay**

SAMS offers a writing course to help students develop their Common App essays, recognizing that not having a strong draft can be a major barrier to starting the college application process. At SAMS, we aim to prepare students holistically as they begin their college application journey.

General concepts of composition are covered and practiced with scholars both analyzing and responding to Common Application Prompts and prompts from their target schools. This course offers a significant amount of peer review, so norms and expectations for interacting with classmates' work is explained, demonstrated, and enforced. The ultimate goal of the course is to help students produce application-ready drafts of their personal essays before the end of the program.

## Financial Need

Summer Academy for Math & Science utilizes a holistic application review and admissions process, looking at the full application and selecting program participants based on a combination of factors.  Part of the holistic evaluation includes a review of financial documentation.  There is no option for participants to pay out of pocket tuition fees for this program, and financial documentation is required for application submission.
