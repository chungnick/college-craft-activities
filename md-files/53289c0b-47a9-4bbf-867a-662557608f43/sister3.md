### Hear what our students and families say.

I would highly recommend CMU's Pre-College Programs to a friend or family member since I was able to experience a sample of college life for a summer, and experience how CMU operates and what it would feel like as an undergrad. It was a greatly beneficial simulation for college life in general, and gave me a good impression of CMU.

~ Madeline H., Summer Session 2025

Our daughter learned so much, and it really clarified for her that she is on the right path in pursuing a BFA in college.

~ Anonymous (Parent), Drama 2025

SAMS was an excellent program for my son. It satisfied all that we were looking for — six weeks, residential, science and math classes, college prep, student-driven recreation, and the ability to explore interests beyond the program scope.

~ Anonymous (Parent), SAMS 2025

It was an incredibly independent and enjoyable experience, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Every student should experience this before college.

~ Brogan C., NHSGA 2025

My daughter absolutely enjoyed the program. She learned so much in such a short period. I am sure she would be happy to apply to Carnegie Mellon University and continue her studies there next year.

~ Anonymous (Parent), Music 2025

I'd say overall, CMU Pre-College made this summer the greatest and most developmental summer I've ever had. It exposed me to a completely different environment and forced me to adapt and change and grow unlike any other experience I've ever had.

~ Kai D., NHSGA 2025

The whole experience was amazing for my son. He does plan to apply to CMU in the fall, as his first choice school.

~ Anonymous (Parent), Computational Biology, 2025

I enjoyed the variety of knowledge that I got from this program. It had so much to offer and was an opportunity I wouldn't miss.

~ Anonymous, Architecture 2025

It was overall such an amazing experience and gave me everything I’d hoped for and more.

~ Meiwen Z., Drama 2025

I enjoyed this immersive experience in learning design foundations and iterative methodology, taught directly by faculty members. It helped me connecting the dots from my own experiments to a more systematic way of thinking about design. I also gained hands-on experience working in the studio, where I was constantly challenged with new ideas. Collaborating with the TAs was also valuable as they were incredibly supportive. I’ve learned so much in just six weeks, and the program helped me develop a deeper passion for design.

~ Alan W., Design 2025

I had a great time on campus. I love the facilities, the professors were amazing, and I really liked the culture among the students I met. I also loved exploring Pittsburgh.

~ Anonymous, SAMS 2024

This program has definitely made me a better person, it’s changed my life in many ways. It solidified the fact that I want to do this for my life and I would really love to continue it with Carnegie Mellon.

~ Kaiya B., Drama 2024

The admissions process for Carnegie Mellon's Pre-College Programs was highly organized and transparent. The online application was easy to navigate allowing him to highlight his abilities. The university's dedication to treating every applicant uniquely was apparent ensuring a sense of fairness and completeness in the process.

~ Anonymous (Parent), AI Scholars 2024

This program showed me the incredible classes and professors at Carnegie Mellon and the work ethic I need to have to be successful here. I also got the full experience from being able to discover new areas of campus and what there is to do around the city.

~ Eliza M., Computational Biology 2024

This was one of the best experiences I have had. I feel I have accomplished a lot and that this program showed me my ability for success in college.

~ Liana J., NHSGA 2024

My experience at CMU's Pre-College Programs gave me a fantastic taste for what my experience could be like attending CMU for undergraduate studies, and solidified my decision to apply next year.

~ Erik S., Architecture 2024
