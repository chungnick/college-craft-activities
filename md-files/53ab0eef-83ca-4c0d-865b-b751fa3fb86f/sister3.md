# Summer Youth Academies FAQs

FAQ Pod May 15, 2020

### What are Summer Youth Academies?

Summer Youth Academies are noncredit courses for youth to explore
different academic disciplines and career pathways. This
collection of courses brings together the historical offerings
from both Academic Talent Search (ATS) and Summer Academies for
High School Students, which were youth programs offered through
Sacramento State in prior years. Summer Youth Academies brings
these two programs together under one umbrella in order to offer
diverse and enriching opportunities for youth.

### What youth courses are being offered at Sacramento State this summer through CCE?

We are offering a variety of courses in our Summer Youth
Academies series. Please see the [course schedule](/course-listing/course-offerings-1) for more
information.

### Who is eligible?

Summer Youth Academies are open to students entering 7th grade
through graduating 12th graders. We do not require placement
tests in order to enroll. Currently, instruction is in English
only; therefore, participants should be proficient in written and
oral English.

### Do you still offer Summer Youth Academies for 4th and 5th grade students?

We have offered summer youth programming in the past for 4th and
5th grade students. Currently, our Summer Youth Academies are for
students entering 7th grade through graduating 12th graders.

### Are the Academies online or in-person?

Some of the courses are online, and some are in-person.
Please see the [course schedule](/course-listing/course-offerings-1) for more
information.

### Do students need to wear face coverings to attend in-person courses? What about instructors?

All students who participate in the Summer Youth Academies should
follow their school district or organization’s COVID-19 policies
and regulations. Currently, students are not required to wear
face coverings while inside campus buildings and classrooms.
However, face coverings are recommended. More information can be
found at <https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/emergency-student-information/>.

### What equipment or resources do I need in order to participate in online courses?

Students will need a computer and an internet connection to
access the courses and participate in class activities. We are
unable to provide laptops or hotspots to students.

### How will online courses be delivered?

The instructors will use Zoom software for live classroom
instruction and interactive projects. In some classes, students
will work on projects at their own pace using Canvas or
Adobe Connect software. Specific software instructions will be
provided prior to each class.

### Who will be teaching the Academies?

Summer Youth Academies are taught by university professors,
community college faculty, industry professionals and other
educators.

### Is homework assigned?

Homework assignments vary by course. Please refer to individual
course listings.

### Where can I find the schedules and pricing?

All schedules and pricing information are on our webpage.

### Are scholarships available?

Yes! To apply for a scholarship, please fill out the [scholarship application](/sites/main/files/file-attachments/youth_programs_2025_scholarship_application.pdf).

### How do I register and enroll?

Please register for courses through our webpage. Registration
begins March 1.

### When is payment due?

Payment is due at the time of registration.

### If I need to cancel my registration, can I get a refund?

If your request is received at least two (2) weeks before the
first class, you may transfer the full amount of your paid fees
to another class or receive a full refund, minus a $10 processing
fee.

### Who do I contact for more information?

Liz Arellanes is the coordinator for the Summer Youth Academies.
[You can reach her
through the program contact form.](/contact-info-pod/contact-us-64)
