# Neubauer Phoenix STEM Summer Scholars

Course Status: Open

Pre-college applications are now open. Join us this coming summer!

## Course Description

From creating the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction to discovering the mathematical theory of black holes, the University of Chicago has long been a pioneer in groundbreaking STEM research. Our students and professors are fearless and creative problem solvers, who engage in interdisciplinary thinking, and who value diverse perspectives. Diversity is a fundamental driver of innovation and progress in STEM fields. By uniting diverse students and faculty for more than a century, UChicago has fostered one of the most unique—and decorated—intellectual communities in the world. The Neubauer Phoenix STEM Summer Program offers the opportunity for outstanding students of all backgrounds who value diversity of thought and experience with an interest in STEM-related areas to be exposed to UChicago’s distinctive approach and abundant research and academic opportunities in STEM fields.

Students selected for the Neubauer Phoenix STEM Summer Program will gain invaluable skills by participating in a hybrid program that combines a virtual mathematics course hosted by [schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world/), followed by spending one week on the UChicago campus. After successfully completing an online, virtual preparatory mathematics course, students will reside on campus for one week and explore the many resources and opportunities available to them at UChicago firsthand through a week of model classes and facility tours. During their week on campus, students will have the opportunity to hear from world-renowned UChicago faculty and alumni in molecular engineering, mathematics, computer science, and other fields, and will experience UChicago’s cutting-edge research facilities firsthand through day trips to locations such as [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/), the [Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering](https://pme.uchicago.edu/), and the [Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/).

The program will be hosted on-campus, and program participants must reside in campus housing for the residential portion of the program.
