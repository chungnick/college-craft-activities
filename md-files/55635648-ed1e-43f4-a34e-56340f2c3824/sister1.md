## UC Students

Only students who are currently enrolled in a degree program at a University of California campus, without academic sanctions, are eligible for the UC student rate.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Per Unit Charge | Campus Fee |
| UC Undergraduate | $436 | $469.05 |
| UC Graduate | $601 | $466.05 |

**Please note:** Figures for tuition and fees represent currently approved or proposed amounts and may not be final. Actual tuition and fees are subject to change by the University of California as determined to be necessary or appropriate. Final approved tuition and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.

Important: Fees are assessed immediately upon enrollment in [CalCentral](http://calcentral.berkeley.edu). UC students are not automatically dropped from classes for non-payment or non-attendance in the summer term. If you do not plan to attend, you must drop your class(es) before the refund deadlines, or you will be financially responsible for tuition and/or fees.

* Transit Fee: $114.50
* Document Management Fee: $73

* Course Materials and Services Fee: *varies per course*

## How to Calculate Cost

Select classes and note the unit value of each course:

MATH N16B: 3 units

ART 8: 4 units

Total units: 7

Calculate Total Undergraduate Tuition: $436 x 7 = $3,052

Add Campus Fee: $469.05

Total Due: $3,793.55\*

*\*This total does not include any cost of housing, living expenses, textbook costs, or Course Materials and Services Fee(s).*

## Campus Fee

This is a mandatory fee set by the referendum by the student body of the University. It applies to both in-person and online enrollments. Campus Fee becomes non-refundable once your first session begins.

## Transit Fee

Transit Fee provides free transportation on all [Alameda County buses](http://www.actransit.org/). The Transit Fee is assessed to any UC student not registered in the previous spring semester on the Berkeley campus. Transit Fee becomes non-refundable once your first session begins.

## Document Management Fee

The Document Management Fee is assessed one-time per status and degree level. For summer, new and returning students with a new status and degree level will be assessed the fee. Continuing and returning students in the same status and degree level will not be assessed this fee again. The Document Management Fee provides unlimited official transcripts sent through first-class mail or provided over the counter in person at [Cal Student Central](http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees).

This fee becomes non-refundable once your first session begins.

## Instructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee

The [Instructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees/instructional-resilience-and-enhancement-fee/) (IREF) is a course materials and services fee that supports tools, infrastructure and staff to support in-person and remote instruction. This $85 fee is assessed to any UC student not registered in the previous spring semester on the Berkeley campus.

## Course Materials and Services Fee

Some departments charge [Course Materials and Services Fee](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees/) for specific classes, such as those with science or computer labs, photography labs, art supplies, or similar costs. Classes with this fee should be noted in the [Class Schedule](http://classes.berkeley.edu/), although the amounts may not be known at the time of publication.

## Summer Tuition Credit

When a course is dropped after the refund deadline of the session, students receive Summer Tuition Credit, instead of refunds, that can be applied toward the tuition of a new subsequently added class in the same summer term. Summer Tuition Credits are not applied toward the tuition of the previously enrolled course(s). Review [this page](https://ssall.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058793414) for further information on Summer Tuition Credit.

---

There may be an additional fee(s) for special programs such as [Study Abroad programs](http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu) or professional school programs.

## Domestic Visitors

Domestic visitor fees apply to those who are not currently enrolled in a degree program at a University of California campus. This includes all U.S. college students, high school students (in the non-residential program), and non-students (general public).

|  | Per Unit Charge | Registration Fee | Document Management Fee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domestic Visitor | $635 | $585 | $73 |

**Please note:** Figures for tuition and fees represent currently approved or proposed amounts and may not be final. Actual tuition and fees are subject to change by the University of California as determined to be necessary or appropriate. Final approved tuition and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.

**Important**: Fees are assessed immediately upon enrollment in [CalCentral](http://calcentral.berkeley.edu) and due within 7 days.

## How to Calculate Cost

Select classes and note the unit value of each course:

MATH N16B: 3 units

ART 8: 4 units

Total units: 7

Calculate Total Undergraduate Tuition: $635 x 7 = $4,445

Add Registration Fee: $585

Add Document Management Fee: $73

Total Due: $5,103\*

*\*This total does not include the $25 Application Fee or any cost of housing, living expenses, travel/visa expenses, or Course Materials and Services Fee(s).*

## Drop for Non Payment Policy

All Summer Sessions fees must be paid in full within **seven days** from when you enroll in classes, or you may be dropped from all of your summer classes.

If fees are not paid in full within 7 days of enrollment, up until one week prior to the beginning of each session, you will be dropped from all of your summer courses. You will receive a warning via email approximately 2-3 days before you are dropped and another on the day you are dropped.

If students enroll in a course one week before their session start date (or later), they will not be dropped for non-payment. Adding or enrolling in a class before the class begins or during the first week of the session means you accept financial responsibility for all related fees.

How does this work?

* On March 1, you enroll in a Session C course, which starts in June, Your payment due date is March 8. If you have not paid in full by this date, you will be dropped from the course on March 9.
* On June 20, you enroll in a Session C course, which starts on June 22. Your payment due date is June 27. If you have not paid in full by this date, you will not be dropped from the course, but you will be financially liable whether or not you attend the course (unless you drop it before the [refund deadline](https://summer.berkeley.edu/registration/schedule#deadlines)).

**Note: Students are not dropped for non-attendance of a course. Students are solely responsible for dropping all their classes, including waitlisted classes, before the appropriate deadlines if they do not plan to attend.**

## Registration Fee

Registration Fee is not refundable once your first session begins.

## Application Fee

There is a $25 fee paid at the time of application (non-refundable).

## Document Management Fee

The Document Management Fee is assessed one-time per status and degree level. For summer, new and returning students with a new status and degree level will be assessed the fee. Continuing and returning students in the same status and degree level will not be assessed this fee again. The Document Management Fee provides unlimited official transcripts sent through first-class mail or provided over the counter in person at [Cal Student Central](http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees).

This fee becomes non-refundable once your first enrolled session begins.

## Course Materials and Services Fee

Some departments charge Course Materials and Services Fee for specific classes, such as those with science or computer labs, photography labs, art supplies, or similar costs. Courses with this fee should be noted in the Class Schedules, although the amounts may not be known at the time of publication.

## Summer Tuition Credit

When a course is dropped after the refund deadline of the session, students receive Summer Tuition Credit, instead of refunds, that can be applied toward the tuition of a new subsequently added class in the same summer term. Summer Tuition Credits are not applied toward the tuition of the previously enrolled course(s).
