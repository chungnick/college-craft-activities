## What is the Secondary School Program?

Harvard Summer School’s Secondary School Program (SSP) is a 4- or 7-week academic program for motivated high school students ready to excel in academically rigorous college courses for college credit.

Within the SSP, you will choose between taking one 4-week course while living on campus, or our more flexible 7-week option that offers residential, online, or commuting formats with the potential for one or two courses.

Over the summer, you’ll gain the confidence to do well in college that comes from successfully navigating a healthy balance between advanced coursework, extracurricular activities, and new friends.

## FAQs

How Long is Harvard’s Secondary School Program?

View More

Harvard’s Secondary School Program has both a 4-week and 7-week offering. The 7-week session starts in mid-June and runs through early August and the 4-week session starts in mid-July and runs through early August. See the [Academic Calendar](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/secondary-school-program/calendar/) for specific program dates and deadlines.

The Secondary School Program requires a full-time commitment throughout the program duration. If you choose to participate in SSP Residential, you’ll want to clear your calendar for the duration of the program. If you have other commitments during the summer, consider SSP Online where you can take one course from home, or our 2-week, non-credit Pre-College Program.

What Will You Get Out of Harvard’s Summer School Program?

View More

At Harvard’s Secondary School Program for high school students, you will expand your academic skills and demonstrate your ability to study at an Ivy League level. Upon successful completion of the program, you’ll receive a letter grade and can request a Harvard transcript that lists your course or courses.

You’ll also begin to build core life skills — such as time management, career planning, and living on your own—that will prepare you for success in college. You will be among a global student body to learn from and have fun with. And you’ll learn that you can thrive outside your comfort zone while making connections and memories that will last a lifetime.

Are Summer School Courses Difficult?

View More

Summer school classes at Harvard are college-level courses, and therefore academically rigorous. But it is the challenge of these courses that attracts our students to the Secondary School Program. You will be proud of all you have accomplished at the end of the summer.

At SSP, you’ll be enrolled in the same credit-bearing Harvard Summer School courses taken by college students and other adult learners. Courses are condensed and intensive, so the work will feel different from high school classes.

Faculty at Harvard Summer School expect a significant commitment of time outside of class for reading and assignments. On average, the work required outside of class time is 8-12 hours per week per four-credit course, but this varies by course and depending on the assignments for the week.

What Courses Should I Take in the Secondary School Program?

View More

There are a lot of great [courses available through the Secondary School Program](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/secondary-school-program/secondary-school-program-courses-and-subjects/), and choosing the right one or two for you can be tough. There are a variety of variables to consider, including your areas of interest and how they will enhance your college application.

When you apply, you will apply to either the 7-Week or 4-Week Secondary School Program, and if you’re accepted you will register for courses within that program length. The 7-week and 4-week programs have different courses, so make sure to look through [what courses are available](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/secondary-school-program/secondary-school-program-courses-and-subjects/) before you choose your program.

Do Secondary School Programs Help with College Admissions?

View More

Participation in Harvard’s Secondary School Program does not guarantee admission to Harvard College.

However, the Secondary School Program can help make your college application stronger, regardless of where you apply. Completion of the program shows that you can succeed in a rigorous college class and that you are a motivated and dedicated student who is ready for life on a college campus.

Previous Harvard Summer School students have gone on to attend college at institutions such as Harvard College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, New York University, Boston University, and Brown University. In fact, 20 percent of respondents to a 2024 survey reported attending an Ivy League institution after attending Harvard Summer School.

The Secondary School Program also offers activities designed to help you navigate the daunting college admissions process. You can meet admissions officers from a variety of US colleges and universities at our college fairs and visits, for example, as well as work on your essays and responses at our college readiness workshops.

When you complete the Secondary School Program, you’ll have an amazing experience to add to your application, and you’ll be ready to get your applications underway.
