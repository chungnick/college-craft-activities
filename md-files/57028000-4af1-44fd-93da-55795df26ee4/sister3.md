## Eligibility For 2026

The admissions committee is looking for mature, academically motivated students who meet both the following criteria:

* Will graduate from high school and enter college in 2026, 2027, or 2028.
* Are at least 16 years old by June 20, 2026, and will not turn 19 years old before July 31, 2026.

**The account must be created, and the application must be completed, by the prospective student and not by parents/guardians, agents, counselors, or anyone else.**

**Certain email domains have historically been difficult for our automated processes to reach (ex., @qq.com, @163.com). If you primarily use one of these email addresses, we request that you use an alternative email address to complete your application and in your correspondence with Harvard Summer School.**

## How to Apply

*Keep in mind that you may only apply for one program each summer, either the Secondary School Program or the Pre-College Program.*

Complete a program application and provide supplemental materials, including:

* The $75 nonrefundable application fee
* Counselor report: You can request a link be sent to your counselor in the application
* Transcripts from 9th grade through the current term (including fall 2025 grades): This can include progress reports, report cards, and educational summaries from your high school.
* Rules and Media Release online form: We require a link be sent to your parent or legal guardian in the application
* If English is not your native language, submit scores from the [TOEFL iBT](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt.html), [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/en-us), or Duolingo language proficiency exam along with your application.

### Application Tips

* **No fee is required to start your application.** You will be asked to pay the nonrefundable application fee only upon submitting the application.
* **Review expectations for TOEFL, IELTS, and Duolingo Academic tests (non-native English speakers only).**Successful students typically score above 103 on the TOEFL with a 25 or above on the writing section (or overall score of 5 with new grading system), 7.5 or above on the IELTS with a 7.0 or above on the writing section, and 135 or above on Duolingo. We do not accept Cambridge English Exam or TOEFL iTP test scores. Be sure to schedule your test appointment as early as possible, so that the test does not delay your application. You can also submit an interview and writing sample from InitialView to supplement your application, but these cannot replace the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo scores.
* **When you apply, choose your program thoughtfully.** You may apply to only one of Harvard Summer School’s college programs for high school students per year.
* **Use a desktop or laptop when completing your application.**You will be asked to write short essays as part of your application. This may be challenging to do on a mobile phone. Therefore, we advise using a desktop or laptop computer to complete your application.
* **Watch your inbox** — you’ll receive an email prompting you to log in to check your application status after you’ve completed your application.

## Selection Process

There will be two admissions deadlines — early application and regular application. After the regular application deadline there will be rolling admissions, if spots are still available in the program.

There is no minimum GPA requirement. We evaluate all information submitted — including transcripts, counselor reports, and your GPA — when considering your application. You are welcome to submit PSAT, SAT, or ACT test scores, but they are not required.

Harvard Summer School does not discriminate against applicants or students on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry or any other protected classification.

## FAQs

When is the early application period?

View More

The early application period is open from December 1, 2025 through January 7, 2026.

See the [Secondary School Program Academic Calendar](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/secondary-school-program/calendar/) for all important dates and deadlines.

Why apply early?

View More

There are several reasons why applying early is a good idea.

It’s less stressful for everyone when you apply early. You avoid the rush and anxiety of applying close to the deadline. You give your parents and other supporting adults more time to do what they need to do to assist you. This includes your counselor, who has a significant role in your application.

More financial aid is available in the early round, so scholarships tend to be larger.

When you apply and are admitted early, you leave yourself ample time to perform necessary post-admission tasks.

Once admitted, you’ll have all of February to call us for academic advising as you choose your courses.

Early admission means you’ll be ready to enroll in courses when registration begins. Registering early means you can reserve your spot in your first-choice classes, even those with limited capacity.

Does attending the Secondary School Program guarantee admission to Harvard?

View More

No. However, attending Harvard Summer School and performing well will strengthen your application to any college or university. Additionally, the Secondary School Program offers many opportunities designed to help you navigate the college application process, gain admission to the college of your choice, and enhance your performance in a college setting.

Is financial aid available?

View More

Yes. Scholarship amounts depend on variables such as family finances, availability of funds, and whether a student lives on campus, commutes, or attends online. Harvard Summer School staff cannot predict how much aid a student may be offered. Students are strongly encouraged to apply for admission to the Secondary School Program and complete the financial aid application by the deadline. All submitted material will be reviewed.

To be eligible:

* You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident

OR

* You must be granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status

AND

* You must complete the applications and all other requirements on time

See [Program Cost](https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/secondary-school-program/cost-and-financial-aid/) for more information.

May homeschooled students apply?

View More

Yes, we welcome applications from students who are being schooled at home. Adults in the student’s life, other than family, may submit a letter of recommendation. One or two letters are sufficient. The Counselor Report cannot be submitted by a family member. If you are unsure of who could complete the form, please email [Inquiry@Summer.Harvard.edu](mailto:inquiry@summer.harvard.edu) and we can help.

Can my family or guardians gain access to my application, records, and information?

View More

In accordance with our policy and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), we cannot release information such as a student’s grades or class schedule to family members or guardians. Except for information defined as “directory information,” no other information about Secondary School Program students is released outside the University — including to parents, guardians, or family members — without the student’s prior written consent, unless otherwise authorized or required by law.

We communicate by email directly with prospective and current students—not with parents or other third parties. Please be sure you check email daily to ensure you receive important communications from the Secondary School Program.

What policies related to conduct should I be aware of?

View More

You should read the Student Handbook and the policy section of the website once admitted, both of which outline student responsibilities in areas such as conduct, attendance, and academic integrity.

Are there exceptions to the minimum age to enroll?

View More

Due to Massachusetts state law and other governmental and University policies, Harvard Summer School has determined that all students enrolled in Harvard Summer School for Summer 2026 must be at least 16 years old by June 20, 2026. Secondary School Program students also can not turn 19 years old before July 31, 2026.
