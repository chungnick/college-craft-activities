Examples of workshop topics include programming with electronics, sensors and robotics, Python coding, and entrepreneurship engineering.

**Eligibility**  
Any High School student with strong interest in MATH is eligible to participate. The initial math level is determined by a placement test.

*MATH 1: Monday & Wednesday -* Lesson Time: 4:00pm- 6:00pm, *(October 15, 2025)*

The course is designed for 9th to 12th grade students and covers Algebra I and elements of Algebra II. Students are required to take a placement test.

**Register for Math 1 here**: *app.campdoc.com/register/psu/abkleinmath125*

****STEM II**** **Introduction to Electronics:** Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6-8 pm, January 20- March 5, 2026

The course is offered to students in grades 7 to 12, covering the basics of Electronics principles.  Students will learn about electricity and electric circuits. They will gain a hands-on understanding of electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, LEDs, transistors, potentiometers, thermistors, photoresistors and more.  Using breadboards, they will gain experience building circuits of varying complexity to create proof of concepts for their designs. They will also be introduced to the use of Computer Aided Electronic design using the Tinkercad website.  This course also includes a module on Solar Home Electrical systems and how the principles used for simple circuit design are applicable to larger systems that can power an entire home.

**STEM III** **Python Gaming:** Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6-8pm, March 10- April 30, 2026. 

The course is offered to students in grades 7 to 12 with the overall course providing the basics of Python programming language, as well as some techniques that could be used to develop games. This seven-week course will introduce programming with a fun twist.  Throughout the course, the students will learn various aspects of the internal representation of information within a computer.  This course covers Graphics, simple animation, and basic programming skills. The students will be able to write several fun game programs, including a dice game, tic-tac-toe, and an encryption code game.  The student exercises and learning experiences are through hands-on assignments as well as fun challenges with the exercises and lessons.   

Register Here: *app.campdoc.com/register/psu/abcestemmodule3intro3326*

****STEM I**** **Programming Electronics******:**** Tuesday and Thursday, October 21 - December 18, 2025

This course exposes the students to more complex circuits which they will build themselves using raw components, wires, breadboards, and an Arduino microcontroller. The student needs no prior programming experience. We will use kits which are designed to teach students how to build a series of projects that perform multiple functions using sensors (distance, motion, temperature, light, etc.) and actuators (motors, lights, sounds, displays). The students will become familiar with the C++ programming language by using and modifying example code provided by the vendors. The overall focus of this program is to immerse the students in the world of electronics all around them. Everything that we use in this high-tech world is a combination of components that are controlled through different processing means.  Students who complete this course will have a stronger understanding of how these parts really work.  If a student has taken a similar course with us before, he/she will have an opportunity to work on new and more interesting projects.  

**Times:** 6:00pm- 8:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays at KleinLife.
