## **CARPENTER SPORTS BUILDING (LIL BOB)**

The main recreation facility on campus is the Carpenter Sports Building, more commonly referred to as the "Lil Bob." The 167,000 square-foot building was named in honor of R.R.M. Carpenter Sr., a former member of the Board of Trustees and long-time benefactor and supporter of the University. The facility first opened in 1942 and was recently renovated and updated in 2013 with the construction of a three floor strength and cardio center and lobby. The facility also offers an indoor pool, small running track, rockwall, gymnasiums, CrossFit space, workout studios, racquetball courts, outdoor turf fields, locker rooms, academic classrooms, and more. The facility received the prestigious NIRSA Outstanding Sports Facility Award in 2014.
