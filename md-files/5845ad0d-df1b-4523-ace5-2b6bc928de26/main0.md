# Design Experience Summer Programs

The UH Design Experience Summer Programs are for high school, college, and degreed
professionals looking for a potential career in architecture, interior architecture,
and/or industrial design. *Design Experience* provides a culturally enriched, learning-by-doing introduction to the different design
disciplines available for undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of
Houston Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and Design.

No previous experience in architecture, industrial design, or other design fields
is required.

In addition to design projects, the architecture programs include lectures on architectural
history and technology, building case studies, and field trips to buildings of special
interest in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin.

*Design Experience* is taught by the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and Design faculty, giving
students the opportunity to participate in portfolio workshops in preparation for
the undergraduate or graduate application process.
