# SUMMER DESIGN EXPERIENCE

## The Idea Factory

A one-week summer program at the University of Houston for high school students wanting
to explore how products are designed and made.

**Session I: 2D to 3D**  
Monday, June 8, 2026–Friday, June 12, 2026  
9:00 a.m.–4:00 p.m.  
Tuition: $500

*Designing a cardboard stool or chair involves transforming flat sheets of cardboard
through precise cutting and folding. Employing effective joinery techniques ensures
secure assembly, while reinforcing corners adds stability. The primary goal is to
create seating that is not only comfortable but also structurally sound and functional.*

**Session II: CAST**  
Monday, June 15, 2026–Friday, June 19, 2026  
9:00 a.m.–4:00 p.m.  
Tuition: $500

*Designing a concrete lamp begins with understanding the concepts of negative and positive
space, as well as exploring the unique properties and casting techniques of concrete.
The result is a lamp that not only illuminates a space but also serves as a striking
decorative piece, showcasing the material's beauty and versatility in modern design.*

***Registration for summer 2026 opening soon!***

## Collaborative Learning

*The Idea Factory* introduces you to product design through fun, hands-on projects emphasizing form
and function, creativity, materials, and fabrication methods. Students work directly
with award-winning UH faculty members, designing and building product solutions in
many different product categories.

Each day is filled with lectures and problem-solving through sketching and building.
All activities expose students to industrial design and deepen their understanding
of how it fosters innovation.

All students need to bring is their natural curiosity and a desire to create something.
No prior design experience is necessary.

All materials and tools are provided.

Lunch is not provided.
