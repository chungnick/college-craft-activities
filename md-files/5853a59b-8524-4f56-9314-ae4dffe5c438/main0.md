# Clinical Anatomy Summer Program (CASP)

For High School Students Interested in Medical and Health Professions

The Clinical Anatomy Summer Program (CASP) at Stanford University offers high school students an immersive introduction to the study of human anatomy and related health professions, including medicine, surgery, dentistry, nursing, biomedical engineering, EMT/paramedics, and physical therapy.

This in-person, week-long program focuses on the anatomy of the human body and its clinical applications. Students will:

* Attend lectures on human anatomy presented by Stanford Medicine faculty
* Participate in hands-on anatomy lab activities and observe surgical demonstrations
* Take part in surgical skills workshops, including opportunities to practice dissection and suturing techniques on animal tissue
* Meet Stanford faculty guest speakers who will introduce students to various medical and health-related careers. *Please note that guest speakers and topics are subject to faculty availability, and typically only a few specialties will be represented each session.*

Throughout the week, anatomical instruction and surgical demonstrations will utilize real human anatomical specimens and cadavers. These educational experiences are made possible through the generosity of body donors, whose contributions are treated with the utmost respect, care, and professionalism.

Please note: This program provides an authentic exposure to medical anatomy and surgical practice. Some students may find aspects of the anatomy lab and surgical demonstrations sensitive or emotionally challenging. Applicants are encouraged to consider their comfort level before applying.
