# Clinical Anatomy Summer Program (CASP)

Frequently Asked Questions

Expand All

#### Who can apply for CASP?

CASP is meant to introduce motivated high school students to a multitude of anatomy topics. This is a great program for students who are considering higher education in medicine, bioengineering, or related fields in healthcare.

#### What is the minimum age for CASP?

Students must be at least 15 years old before the first day of their scheduled session.

#### What is the cost to attend CASP?

The total cost of CASP is $4,000.

A $1,000 non-refundable deposit must be made 7 days after acceptance. The remaining $3,000 tuition payment is due on May 9, 2025.

There are no additional fees associated with CASP. Lunch and supplies will be provided.

#### Where will lectures and activities be held?

Lectures will be held in various lecture-style rooms around the School of Medicine. These locations will be based on availability and may vary from day to day.

#### What is the agenda for CASP?

The Clinical Anatomy Summer Program focuses on teaching anatomy that has a clinical significance. Although our agenda may vary slightly from year to year, the basic format remains the same. Students will begin each day with an anatomy lecture from Clinical Anatomy faculty. After lunch, activities vary from campus tours, lab visits, learning from guest speakers, and participating in hands-on activities such as dissection, suturing, instrument handling, and more.

#### Is CASP a residential program?

CASP is a day program, not a residential program. Students will be responsible for daily transportation to and from campus each day.

#### Can students outside of the Bay Area participate in CASP?

We welcome students from all over the country and abroad. Though, please note that CASP is a non-residential summer program. Visiting students will need to plan housing and transportation accordingly.

The Division of Clinical Anatomy cannot sponsor any international visas for international students who are interested in attending CASP.

#### Do you provide housing or accomodations?

CASP is a day program and does not offer housing to our students. However, students participating in our summer program are eligible to stay at housing units on campus- based on availability.

High school students under 18 will require a parent or guardian to live with them on campus in keeping with the university's Protection of Minors policy.  There are a limited number of units available to families, as housing inventory is low and demand for summer housing for our students is quite high.

You will need to submit some forms and documentation to show proof of their Stanford affiliation. We can assist with providing those documents once the student is accepted to our program and their tuition is fully paid for.
