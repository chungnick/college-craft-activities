# Clinical Anatomy Summer Program (CASP) Curriculum

* The Clinical Anatomy Summer Program focuses on teaching anatomy that has a clinical significance. Although our agenda may vary slightly from year to year, the basic format remains the same. Students will begin each day with an anatomy lecture from Clinical Anatomy faculty. After lunch, activities vary from campus tours, lab visits, learn from guest speakers, and participate in hands-on activities such as dissection, suturing, instrument handling, and more.
