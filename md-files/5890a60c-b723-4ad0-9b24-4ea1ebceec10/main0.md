### Medical Clearance

Visiting summer students at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are allowed to register and will not be penalized for failure to meet the state-mandated pre-matriculation immunization requirements for full-time students.

This change of policy is supported by an interpretation of the law by a consultant with the Immunization Services Division of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health. Visiting summer students are advised that it is always prudent to be adequately protected from diseases that are preventable with available vaccines. For your information, the vaccines required for matriculating students in the State of North Carolina include DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis within the last 10 years), Polio, and MMR (Mumps, Measles Rubeola, and Rubella). In addition, the following vaccines are recommended: Hepatitis B series, Varicella (chicken pox), Meningococcal Meningitis, and a test for tuberculosis if coming from a country with high prevalence of disease. For your convenience, these vaccines are available at [Campus Health Services](http://campushealth.unc.edu/) by calling 919-966-2281 for an appointment. Costs are at or below community rates.

## After Acceptance

The Summer School will begin sending decision notifications and other information in March. Notifications and other information can be found on your application status page.

### Setting Up an Email Address

Once you are accepted as a Summer Visiting  Student, **you must create a UNC email address.**Information about how to create this email address will be sent to your application status page. More information about what must be done if you are accepted can be found in the [visiting student’s webinar.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abQPYWEjGM5myWmbkYQk_diMldWf68WaAM20p8skrhU/preview?rm=minimal#slide=id.p1)

### Course Load

Dual enrolled high school students should be aware that courses offered in summer are the same rigorous courses offered during the academic year but in a condensed format that requires diligence and commitment to assignments. Classes generally meet 90 minutes per day (or the equivalent of asynchronous activities) and can require up to 3 to 4 hours of additional out-of-class work **each day**.

The maximum credit hour load cannot exceed more than 4 credit hours in the Second Session for high school students.

The University defines full-time enrollment for the summer as 4 hours for undergraduate students and 3 hours for graduate students in one of the summer terms.

### Grades and Eligibility

All grades for Summer School Visitors become part of an academic transcript at UNC-Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill requires that even non degree-seeking students—including Summer School Visitors—maintain an acceptable GPA to continue to enroll. More eligibility information can be found on the [advising website.](https://studentsuccess.unc.edu/good-standing/)

### Auditing

Auditing of courses is permitted **only in lecture-based courses.** For information on the auditing process, please visit the [registrar’s website](https://registrar.unc.edu/auditing-a-course/).

Please note: dual-enrolled high school students cannot audit courses.

### Drop, Cancel, or Withdraw

**To drop a course**, please initiate the drop through Connect Carolina.

**To cancel** all your summer session courses (only done **BEFORE classes begin**), please contact Summer School at [summer\_school@unc.edu](mailto:summer_school@unc.edu).

**To withdraw** from your summer session courses (only done **AFTER classes begin**), follow the instructions on the [Registrar’s web page.](https://registrar.unc.edu/submit-your-term-withdrawal/)

Deadlines for these actions can be found on the [registrar’s page](https://registrar.unc.edu/).

### Attendance Policy

Regular class attendance is a student obligation, and a student is responsible for all the work, including tests and written work, of all class meetings. No right or privilege exists that permits a student to be absent from any given number of class meetings. Students should check with the instructor for attendance policies.
