## Financial Aid

New or continuing students in good academic standing in a program leading to a degree from UNC-Chapel Hill may be eligible for financial aid during the summer. Contact the Office of Scholarships and Student Aid, CB# 2300, 111 Pettigrew Hall, 919-962-8396, or online by student status:

* [Incoming Students](https://studentaid.unc.edu/incoming/what-aid-is-available/summer-aid/)
* [Current Students](https://studentaid.unc.edu/current/what-aid-is-available/summer-aid/)
* [Graduate Students](https://studentaid.unc.edu/graduate/what-aid-is-available/summer/)

Visiting students enrolled in summer courses are not eligible for financial aid from UNC-Chapel Hill. Check with your home institution for potential assistance.

### Financial assistance for summer graduation

Planning to graduate in the summer or thinking about it? You could be eligible for financial assistance through the summer degree completion program for undergraduates. This successful program has been in effect for five years and provides an opportunity for more students to graduate in August.

You become eligible for funding when you apply for summer graduation and enroll in all remaining degree requirements. No additional application is required. For information about applying for graduation, see <https://registrar.unc.edu/applying-for-graduation/>. You will receive a communication in ConnectCarolina from the Office of Scholarships and Student Aid when the award for degree completion funds has been made.

Funding is limited, and available funds will be distributed on a rolling basis. The amount awarded will cover your minimum degree requirements for graduation up to a maximum of 9 credit hours at either the resident or nonresident rate.

To apply for graduation, click [graduation](http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/graduation/).
