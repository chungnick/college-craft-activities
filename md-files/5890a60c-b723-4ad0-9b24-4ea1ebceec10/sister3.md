This course considers theories of peacebuilding and state-building, investigates the various challenges facing post-conflict states, and assesses the role that international actors play in this process. Case study based. War is hell, but trying to establish peace after years of bloody conflict and genocide can produce its own pain. What should war-torn countries do to promote reconciliation and healing? Is it possible to establish peace without politicizing the pain of a traumatized nation? What legal options are available to deter future atrocities? Can the victors hold the perpetrators accountable by putting them on trial without destabilizing the country or being accused of “victor’s justice”? This course examines the range of judicial and non-judicial mechanisms for dealing with a country’s large-scale abuses of human rights, as well as violations of international humanitarian law. These mechanisms are intended to transition a country from war to peace, and in many cases from authoritarian to democratic forms of government. The goal is to rebuild a society based on the rule of law, but this process is often fraught with controversy, as the road to peace is seldom easy. By analyzing examples since World War II, students will understand why a one-size-fits-all approach to transitional justice is deeply flawed and why context is the key to securing lasting tranquility between warring factions.
