Academic Life

##### **Intermediate Immersive Spanish**

Intermediate Spanish offers an engaging opportunity to deepen your proficiency and gain confidence using the language in everyday situations. Beyond traditional grammar and syntax practice, class sessions will explore diverse aspects of Spanish and Catalan social and artistic life, fostering thoughtful and dynamic discussion. Throughout the course, you will expand your vocabulary and develop greater fluency through meaningful communication. In the final stage of the program, you will complete projects that encourage connection with the local community and reflection on your observations and experiences in Barcelona.

At least 3 years of Spanish is required. Ability to communicate proficiently in Spanish; both in writing and orally.

##### **Barcelona in Ten Buildings**

An intriguing overview of the history of Barcelona through the analysis of ten iconic buildings, representative of the social, economic and political evolution of the city. These architectural sites represent a showcase of the evolution of European and International architecture through time. The ten buildings; Temple of Augustus, Santa Maria del Mar, Parlament de Catalunya, Mercat de la Boqueria, Palau de la Música, Parc del Laberint or Parc Güell, Pabellon Mies Van der Rohe, Nou Camp Stadium and Museu del Barca, Sagrada Familia and Torre Agbar are each located in a specific neighborhood, so that the tour through the history of the city also introduces the territorial aspect in the analysis of Barcelona. The selection of the buildings also offers different types of functions of architecture from religious, to political or industrial.

* **Temple of Augustus and the Roman remains:**Barcelona was founded by the Romans in the first century AD in times of Emperor Augustus. The remains of the Roman past are an example of a small Roman Colony.
* **Santa Maria del Mar:** Considered the most beloved church in Barcelona and a fine example of the Gothic Architecture of Barcelona. Located in the Born district, Santa Maria del Mar represents the expansion of the city during the Middle Ages and the important role of the church during those times.

* **Palau de la Música:**An important example of the Modernist Movement in Barcelona. A magnificent auditorium represents the puissance of the new industrial bourgeoisie.
* **Parc del Laberint or Parc Güell:** As the new industrial bourgeoisie created a new city outside of the main city,  their summer mansions in the foothills of Collserola were designed to showcase the social position of each of these wealthy families.
* **Pabellon Mies Van der Rohe:** Barcelona has a long tradition of hosting international events such as the Universal Exposition of 1888 and the International Exposition of 1929 or the Olympic Games in 1992 that were held at this site.
* **Nou Camp Stadium and Museu del Barça:**Barcelona football team is one of the most recognizable trademarks of the city. The newly remodeled stadium  “Nou Camp” will strengthen this urban icon.
