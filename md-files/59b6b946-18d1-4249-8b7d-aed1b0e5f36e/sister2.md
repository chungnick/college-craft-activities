GENIUS Science provides understanding and solutions to environmental problems using scientific knowledge. Students are expected to present a solution using scientific methods for a problem which fits in one of the following categories.

Each GENIUS Science project **can be prepared and presented by up to two students**. Presentation of the models is highly encouraged, but not required. However, a research description paper (with data, graphics, photos, and drawings of the design concept) is required as part of the application and presentation.

###### SCIENCE | Environmental Quality

The category of Environmental Quality encompasses the study of assessing, analyzing, and providing solutions to the problems of environmental pollution-such as air, water, soil, and noise pollution- and their potential effects on the health of all organisms, including humans. The world around us changes all the time. How is our quality of life affected by the environment?

GENIUS Olympiad seeks solutions to problems related to indoor and outdoor air quality; the health effects of air, water, soil, radiation, and noise pollution; pollution management (e.g., systems for early warning or control of polluting incidents); the measurement of pollution; waste water treatment and remediation; solid waste treatment and remediation; the effects of radiation; and more.

###### SCIENCE | Ecology and Biodiversity

The category of Ecology and Biodiversity encompasses the study of plant and animal populations, plant and animal communities, the network of relations among organisms. How do organisms relate to their environment and food sources, at both large and small scales?

GENIUS Olympiad seeks solutions to problems related to the movement of food, resources, and energy through living communities; the assessment of the value of the local ecosystems; the effects of populations on ecosystems (e.g., excessive fishing, excessive farming); the destruction of habitat and its effects on the health of living organisms, including humans; genetic pollution and hybridization and their effects on food security and biodiversity; the effects of climate change on biodiversity; the distribution and abundance of organisms; and more.

###### SCIENCE | Resource and Energy

The category of Resources and Energy encompasses the study of energy sources, such as mineral, water, wood, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, wind, sun, and soil sources, including efforts to increase their efficiency in producing energy and to reduce the impact of their use on the environment. How do we use these resources? How can we do it better?

GENIUS Olympiad seeks solutions to problems related to responsible use of non-renewable natural resources; efficient use of non-renewable natural sources (e.g., in energy and goods production); the contribution of non-renewable natural sources to global warming; the efficient use of renewable natural sources (e.g., in energy and goods production); soil degradation, erosion, and remediation; the efficient use of water resources, and more.

###### SCIENCE | Human Ecology and Social Sciences

The category of Human Ecology and Social Sciences encompass the study of the dynamic relationships between humans and their natural, social, and built environments, drawing on perspectives from anthropology, behavioral economics, and psychology to understand how cultures, incentives, and individual decision-making shape these interactions. Environmental changes influence human behavior, values, and social structures, while human actions—guided by economic choices, cultural norms, and psychological perceptions—profoundly affect the environment in return. The world of humans is inextricably connected with the environment, raising critical questions about how human interactions are changing over time and how those changes both respond to and reshape ecological systems.

GENIUS Olympiad seeks solutions to problems related to society and its knowledge about sustainability; socials changes that affect the environment; social justice in regard to food and water supplies; social justice in regard to access to education and quality of life; education about the environment and sustainability; the business and economy of sustainability; sustainable engineering and construction; society and energy usage; developing a sustainable low-waste society; social behavior involving recycling, reuse, and waste reduction programs; social views about environmental regulations, policies and programs; and more.

###### SCIENCE | Innovation

Innovation is defined as creating new or different tangible products or processes as a result of a novel idea or a method to make our lives better, healthier, and environmentally friendly.

GENIUS Olympiad seeks engineering and design solutions for a specific use, such as new or different tools and equipment used in life, such as kitchens, schools, office space etc. to make process faster or more effective (reducing waste, etc), or more user friendly and healthier.

GENIUS Entrepreneurship raises awareness of environmental values in the business world, from bringing green products and services to market to developing a social responsibility plan for any business aiming to have a positive relationship to the society and the environment in which it operates.

Each GENIUS Entrepreneurship project **can be prepared and presented by up to two students**. Participants must prepare and present a business idea and plan to judges as though they were making a pitch for funding for their business plan, also known as an investment proposal. At GENIUS Olympiad, presentations will be made in formal business attire and should include a Powerpoint/Prezi (or similar) presentation of no more than 10 minutes before QandA.

The Entrepreneurship category challenges students to develop innovative business solutions that reduce human impact on the environment. Participants may propose a new product or technology, enhance an existing one to make it more sustainable, or create a social responsibility plan aimed at helping existing businesses or industries become greener.

Each project must be supported by a comprehensive business plan and a visual presentation (PowerPoint, Prezi, or similar) that clearly explains both the environmental and market value of the proposed solution. The business plan should begin with an analysis of the current market or industry landscape, including potential buyers, suppliers, existing and future competitors, substitute technologies, and cultural or market dynamics relevant to the product or proposal.

**For product- or technology-based entries**, the plan must describe the solution in detail, define the target market, propose pricing and promotional strategies, and explain how the product will be delivered to the customer. **For social responsibility projects**, the plan should assess the current environmental impact of a specific business or industry, outline proposed changes, and evaluate how these changes will affect environmental performance, customer experience, pricing, and the company’s market position.

All entries should also address the financial cost of implementation, expected environmental outcomes, potential challenges to delivery, and competitive advantage.

Genius Robotics is a student-centric competition that enables students to understand the role of engineering and research in environmental issues. Genius Robotics encourages students to discover novel solutions to known environmental problems by requiring them to design, build, test, and control their unique robots. It provides students with a lifetime experience and an opportunity to enhance their life skills, such as being a team member, researching, and problem-solving.

Each GENIUS Robotics project **can be prepared and presented by a team of up to three students.** . Schools may apply with multiple teams. However, each student may be part of only one team. There can be only one robot for each team, which cannot be shared among teams. Only team members participating in the Olympiad will be recognized for the awards and announcements.

**##### ROBOTICS | 2026 Game - Genie Firefighter**
Genie Firefighter is designed to measure the performance of the robots and the teams in cleaning land by removing debris and putting off fire by
throwing water on fire. The field has a shared warehouse with stored water cubes. The mission is to clean debris to create a safe zone and using water
cubes, put off the fire within fire zone without damaging homes.

**Robot Type and categories:** The applications will be accepted only in one category (e.g. REV, TETRIX, VEX-Exp, VEX-V5, VEX-Pro or kits or self-developed robots with similar motor power using less than 12V). Any other robot development kit or self-developed robots can be used only if it is approved by the Genius Olympiad. Consult the committee before building your robot by [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you want to use any robot development kit
other than the one listed above, with motor power information and kit name.

**Mission:** The robots compete in a field, which will be divided into two identical subfields and a shared area (shared water warehouse). The subfields will be separated by blue and green lines, and teams will have their own region to complete the tasks. All zones are marked with color tape.

1st Task is to collect the debris items (tennis balls) from the safe zone and move them into the debris bins placed on the floor outside the field.

2nd Task is to collect water cubes (2.2 inches gel cubes) from the shared water warehouse to putt of fire at the fire zone without getting into smoked damaged area and touching house (buckets).

There will be at least three rounds for each team, and the team may compete on either the blue or red side of the field; different rounds may be held in different fields.

**Mission Details**  

For collecting debris items, 1st  task, Genie Firefighter is responsible for picking debris items (tennis balls) from the safe zone and transporting them into the debris bin, located outside of the field. Robots can collect multiple debris items at once. Robots can pick up debris items from smoke damaged area or within their land, if they drop them. Robots can NOT collect debris from the fire zone. Debris from safe zone must be cleared completely before starting second task.

For putting off fire, 2nd  task, Genie Firefighter is responsible for collecting water cubes (picking up gel cubes from the shared warehouse) and transporting them into the fire zone. For this task, Genie Firefighter can carry maximum 5 cubes at a time. They need to throw/place the water cubes into the fire zone without getting into smoked damaged area and touching houses (buckets). For this task, robots can NOT enter smoked damaged area. Genie Firefighter is not allowed to pass the border of their subfield but is allowed to enter the shared warehouse zone. The robot will start from the robot lot, and teams are allowed to make modifications to the robot, such as adding or removing attachments or changing the code during the competition round ONLY within the robot lot. Any other interference is not allowed during the rounds.

**Placement of water gel cubes:** There will be **20 water gel cubes**, they will be randomly distributed within the shared water warehouse.

**Placement of tennis balls (debris):** There will be **10 tennis balls** as debris and they will be randomly distributed within the safe zone for each team.

**Placement of buckets (houses):** There will be **3 buckets** as houses and they will be randomly distributed within the smoked damaged zone for each team.

**Time and round limits:** The total time given for a single round is 3 minutes. There will be at least three rounds for each team, and the team may compete on either the blue or green side of the field; different rounds may be held in different fields.

**Scoring**  

* 20 points for each debris item (tennis ball) transported into the debris collection bin.
* 20 points for each water gel cube placed within fire zone (the line will count as part of fire zone).
* 100 additional points if all 10 debris items (tennis balls) placed in debris bin.
* 100 additional points for each set of five cubes placed within fire zone.
* No penalty if tennis balls left on team’s undesignated subfield.
* No penalty if the robot gets into smoked damaged area to pick up balls without touching (damaging) house (buckets).
* 20 points penalty for each tennis ball left at safe zone, fire zone, or smoked damaged area.
* 10 points penalty for each time robot touches the buckets while picking up tennis balls.
* 20 points penalty for each water cubes left at smoked damaged area or safe zone.
* 20 points penalty for each water cubes left at undesignated subfield of the team.
* 300 points penalty if the team moves more than five water cubes at a time.
* 300 points penalty if the team moves second set of cubes before using them to place at fire zone.
* 300 points penalty if the team crosses the line into smoked damaged zone (it can touch the line but cannot cross over).
* 50 points penalty for each case if the robot passes to the other side of the field.
* 50 points penalty for each time the team interferes with the robot outside the robot lot.
* When the game ends, if there are any items on the robot, they will be considered as left at teams undesignated subfield.
* If teams violate any fair play rules, like destroying or blocking the opponent team’s robot intentionally, preventing the other team from achieving the tasks by swiping items to their subfield, the team will lose 300 points. In addition to these penalties, teams violating fair play rules can be subject to disqualification from the competition by the referee's decision.

   please refer the corresponding guidelines.
3. Is it allowed to use VEX IQ kits and components for building the competition robot?  
   Yes.
4. Is there a restriction on controlling the robot?  
   Only wireless communication is allowed for driving robots.
5. What if my robot is not ready before the application deadline, can I still apply?  
   Yes you can apply. Your final version of the robot does NOT have to be ready during application. However, you must have a robot in hand to provide a video showing your capabilities and early version of the robot.
6. Can I use Makeblock kits?  
   The answer is yes, but you need to let us know what type (starter or mbots).
7. Can I use Meet Edison with other Lego parts?  
   Yes, you can use Meet Edison along with Lego kit and register under Lego category.
8. When the mission is considered completed for a team to go back to robot lot and earn bonus points?  
   All tasks are considered completed when all recycled items are collected into the recycle bins, all water samples are collected in to the lab and all stray animals are transported to the ocean.
9. When the round ends, if robot has some balls or cubes on it and could not place them on time, is there any penalty?  
   It depends on the last location of the robot. i.e. If there is a stray animal on the robot and robot is at the coastline, it gets penalty. If it is still on the island, there is no penalty.
10. Can we have more than one controllers/operators acting simultaneously?  
    You can have up to two controllers, controling one single robot.- Can we start with a single robot which can divide into seperate robots on the field?  
      You can have only one single robot operating on the field.
    - Is there any restriction on orientation of robot in robot zone to start the game?  
      Robot zone is the free area that you can do anything including changing the starting direction of the robot.
    - How much time is provided to calibrate and setup robot before each rounds?  
      There is no certain time but the competition rounds will take around 5 hours total (2.5 hours each session) and each team will have about 4-5 rounds. So you can think of one round at every 30 minutes. It may change based on our competition scheduler software.
    - what will happen if a team misses its competition?  
      team may be disqualified, therefore students must be at their designated desk at all times when they are not competiting and also should be near their field as their time comes up according to th provided schedule.
    - What if the robot interferes or destroys an opponent’s robot intentionally or due to lack of control?  
      This is against fair play rules and the team would be disqualified from Genius Robotics if it were intentional. If it were due to lack of control, team would lose lots of points each time it interferes the opponent robot.
    - Can we collect many recycled items and transport them together?  
      You cannot collect multiple recycled items at once.
    - Is there any difference on touching/detecting and crossing the opponent’s border?  
      You can touch the border (3 inches) to detect the opposite side but crossing the border is not allowed (penalty points).
    - Is it allowed crossing the border by extended part of the robot, not with the original size?  
      No.
    - How much time is allocated for the mission?  
      3 minutes.
    - Can robots carry recycled items and debris item at the same time?  
      No. There is a penalty for that.
    - Are robots allowed to throw the recycled items to the recyle bin?  
      Yes, you can throw the recycled items.
    - Are robots allowed to throw the debris item into the debris bin?

GENIUS Art raises public awareness to take action on global environmental problems and solutions.  
Each GENIUS Art project **can be prepared and presented by only one student**.

###### ART | Photography

Photojournalistic, documentary, experimental, or expressive, photography in all of its machinations can be used to inspire, inform, motivate, and otherwise provide the viewer with a distinct experience related to environmental issues. GENIUS photography encompasses a wide variety of artwork which uses the environment and all its many aspects, including human impacts on nature, which is a lot more realistic and more in accordance to what we see around us, as their subject.

Turning your lens toward a scene of decay, pollution and photographing it in a way that induces an emotional reaction in the viewer can probably do more to help protect the wilderness than a photograph of a pristine landscape will. By supporting the power of photographic storytelling, we motivate society to make a positive change to raise awareness about endangered cultures, threatened environments and social concerns through photography.

GENIUS photography should (but not limited to) express the way natural systems respond and do not respond with the environmental issues, express a sense of frustration about the world we live in, express changes society made through construction, pollution, and land-management policies, and express actions of moments within cities, human environment, and nature to raise awareness. Sometimes, simple photos, such as green coming out of a concrete wall or road can be an inspiration.

###### ART | Poster Design

A GENIUS poster should motivate to think differently about the things that people may be learning or doing about environment, should aim to create a behavioral change regarding environmental problems (local or global) such as global warming, water (pollution or usage), air pollution or quality, waste management (reduce, reuse, and recycle), energy, etc. It can be created digitally or any form of painting (including pencil). 90% or more of the artwork must be created by the student artist. For professional examples, please visit "[Environmental Awareness Posters](http://cargocollective.com/alicexian/Environmental-Awareness-Posters)" or "[environment awareness campaign](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/142215300703078850/)" or "[others](https://www.uprinting.com/blog/16-environmental-awareness-posters-advertisements/)"

###### ART | Mixed Media

Mixed media art refers to a visual art form that combines a variety of media in a single artwork. For example, if you draw with ink, then paint over it with watercolors, then add some highlights in colored pencil, and these drawing can be enhanced with addition of collage of photos/recycled papers which can also be colored or penciled over, and cotton balls, and tree branches, or any material including recycled material can be glued to give a 3-D look for the artwork- that's mixed media!

A GENIUS Mixed Media should transform your life experiences to create a unique and quirky artwork to showcase an environmental focus. GENIUS Mixed Media artwork should be in 3-D form, and including glued colored papercuts incorporated into art would be enough to give a 3-D look for the artwork. Students are highly encouraged to use recycled materials, including paper, old postcards, newspapers, cans, fabric, etc to provide a 3-D mixed media work. Also, make sure that your artwork backing is strong enough to carry your artwork. The depth of the artwork should not be more than 8" (12 cm).

GENIUS Music heightens public concern for environmental problems and offers solutions by pulling at the auditory heartstrings through performance (as a performer). GENIUS Music allows the student artists to influence public at the level of the heart. From the time of Homer until the present day, musical creators have presented ideas to the public in new ways, reaching them in ways that no others could, and calling people to action.

Performances may be in any style, but must exhibit a high degree of performance acumen, rehearsal, care, and thought. All projects must include a tie-in to the environment.

Performers may use an already-written composition that was created with reference to the environment. You may choose to use a piece in your language, but explain how that piece connects listener with environment. You will read your Artist Statement prior to the performance, which will allow the audience to understand why you chose this piece.

###### Music | Solo Performance
