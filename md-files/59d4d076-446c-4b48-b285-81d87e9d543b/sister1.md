## THE ASPIRING SCHOLARS DIRECTED RESEARCH PROGRAM

#### Unlock your potential

#### Applying to ASDRP

[RSVP for future applicant webinar](https://www.asdrp.org/rsvp)

Every year, ASDRP reviews thousands of applications from highly-qualified high school students from around the Bay Area, California, and even from other states. Applications can be submitted three times a year for student researchers in the summer, fall, and spring. Because ASDRP receives far more applicants than there are positions available, applications are competitive and late applications will not be considered under any circumstances. Please see the schedule below for application deadlines. Questions about an application status should be directed to [admissions@asdrp.org](mailto:admissions@asdrp.org). 

​

What is the Acceptance Rate for ASDRP?

* Acceptance rates vary from term to term.
* ASDRP admits as many applicants are there are open research positions.
* The number of open research position changes when researchers graduate or leave ASDRP.
* Most researchers stay in ASDRP year-round, and for multiple years, the number of admitted researchers each term is very limited.
* Every year, ASDRP receives several times more applicants as there are research positions available.

​

Historical acceptance rates from the last year -

Summer 2025: 31% [Early 1]; 12% [Early 2]; 3% [Regular]

Spring 2025: 75% [Early]; 25% [Regular]

​

I am Currently Doing Research at ASDRP, Do I Need to Re-apply?

* Researchers who leave ASDRP for a term will need to re-apply to come back to ASDRP.
* Continuing researchers do not need to re-apply to continue research each term.
* Most researchers at ASDRP stay here year-round, and for multiple years. Some move around between research groups to explore different fields, and others stay in one research group for their entire time at ASDRP.

​

Do I need prior research experience to apply for ASDRP?

* No. While prior research experience is always a plus, ASDRP does not require prerequisite research experience.
* We only require an appetite to learn and desire to be a scientist. A willingness to learn a lot very quickly is critical for success in research.

​

Does ASDRP require letters of recommendation?

* No, admissions decisions at ASDRP are made purely on the basis of application quality rather than based on external letters of recommendation, and therefore letters of recommendation are not required to apply for ASDRP. However, if the applicant so chooses, a supplementary letter of recommendation may be submitted to [admissions@asdrp.org](mailto:admissions@asdrp.org). The Admissions Committee typically does not use letters of recommendation for admissions decisions.

Do I need to be a resident of the Bay Area to apply for ASDRP?

* No. ASDRP receives dozens of applications each year from individuals around California, the United States, and Europe/North America.
* Individuals who are from outside of the Bay Area may work remotely.

​

Who is eligible to apply for ASDRP?

* All high school students who are:
* Currently enrolled in or entering 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grade

​

Undergraduates who are interested in doing research at ASDRP should email a resume to the appropriate Department Chair.

​

What are the criteria for admissions to ASDRP?

* ASDRP values diversity, rigor, and passion in its student researchers, and we firmly believe in accessibility to opportunities in STEM for all.
* Test scores, grade point averages, and involvement in academic competitions are not defining criteria for admissions.
* We encourage all high schoolers interested in doing something meaningful with their time in the summer or after hours during the school year to apply.

​

What do I do if my application is rejected?

* Unfortunately, given the large volume of applications received on a daily basis, and the limited number of openings across research groups at ASDRP, a significant number of applicants are not offered admissions in any given cycle.
* If you are not admitted to ASDRP, we welcome you to apply again in the next admissions cycle.

Each year, ASDRP awards several partial and full scholarships for students from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue STEM research. We firmly believe that finances should never be a barrier in STEM opportunities, so all applicants are encouraged to apply, and to apply specifically for financial aid where there is need.

We believe keeping a minimal operational cost is consistent with the spirit and vision of ASDRP. The above cost does not reflect the actual cost of taking on a student researcher. In fact, program costs account for less than half of the resources and funding required to take on a research student. This would not be made possible without the generous support of our corporate and community sponsors, research grants, and other sources  of funding.
