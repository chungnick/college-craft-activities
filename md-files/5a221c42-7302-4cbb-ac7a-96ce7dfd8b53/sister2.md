# The MOTER Program

The MOTER program is an outreach initiative designed to give high school teachers the tools necessary to teach their students the fundamentals of cancer biology using model-based learning and group activities. We collaborate with teachers to provide hands-on activities that reinforce national NGSS and state bioscience standards.

Many of our cancer-related educational activities involve hands-on modeling kits that make learning about genetics colorful, engaging, and fun. Kits are given to high school teachers and their students work in small groups to explore the impact of mutation on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.

The goal is to support and empower the communities of southern Arizona to grow their own cancer practitioners and researchers. We are dedicated to helping build a diverse workforce that effectively serves the cancer-related needs of all communities in the region.

## Topics include:

* The Central Dogma (replication, transcription & translation)
* Mutations, gene expression, & tumor suppression
* Protein structure and function
* Experimental techniques (DNA sequencing, PCR, & enzyme restriction)

If you are a high school teacher interested in learning more about the MOTER program or to receive lesson kits for your classroom, contact the Cancer Research Education and Training Coordination (CRTEC) team at [**uacc-crtec@arizona.edu**](mailto:uacc-crtec@arizona.edu "mailto:uacc-crtec@arizona.edu").
