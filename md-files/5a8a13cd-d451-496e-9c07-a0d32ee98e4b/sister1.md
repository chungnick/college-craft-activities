### **Penn GEMS Activities**

The activities listed below are subject to change, and not all participants will experience every activity. Students will be divided into groups and take part in a variety of experiences. While we are still finalizing this year’s program, here are some examples of activities from past years:

**GLOW IN THE DARK SCIENCE**  
What does a cell in your body look like up close? Through hands-on labs, you’ll learn how cells travel throughout your body and how engineers are actually making body cells that fight disease!

**MECHANICAL ENGINEERING IN ACTION!**  
Mechanical Engineers create everything from cell phones and toys to medical devices and cars. Explore the physics of force, energy transfer, and mechanical advantage as you work in teams to design, build, and test a launching catapult. Apply the engineering design process, experimenting with variables and refining your prototype, to achieve maximum distance and compete for top honors!

**CENTRAL DOGMA IN ACTION**  
Discover how your body makes proteins by following the path from DNA to RNA to protein! You’ll extract DNA from fruit, see how much you can get, and explore glowing RNA and proteins to learn how scientists study how our cells work.

**SHAKE IT UP: EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING**Can your tower survive the shake test? In this hands-on workshop, you’ll explore how engineers design strong buildings, then work in a team to build your own balsa wood tower and test it in an earthquake simulator!

**IT’S A ROBOT**  
What do NASA’s Mars Rover and Honda’s ASIMO need to do interact and react in their environments? Learn the basic electro-mechanical principles behind robotics technology and more when you get to play with your own robot.

**WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE?**  
Computers, iPods, cell phones, websites, video games, animated movies, and robots are just a few things created by computer scientists. Learn how to think like a computer scientist and maybe even create a few things of your own!

**IMAGINATION TO ANIMATION**  
Love animated movies and video games? You’ll learn some basic computer programming skills that any animation or game maker needs and leave with something to show your friends and family.

**BIOENGINEERING ETHICS 101**  
Just because we *can* build it—*should* we? In this interactive session, you’ll dive into real-world examples like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and AI bias to explore how engineers make decisions that impact our world. Through debates and case studies, you’ll learn why ethics and responsibility matter in STEM.

##### “Thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity. All the staff were so kind, I learnt so much, and made many wonderful friends. The experience was phenomenal and my expectations were exceeded.”

###### *Shubi, 9th Grade Camper*

##### “This program helped my children with confidence and inspired their love for learning. They developed new skills, made lasting friendships, and gained valuable teamwork experience. It truly helped them both grow academically and personally.”

###### *Megha, 2025 Camp Parent*
