The camp fee was $650 per participant in 2025. The fee for 2026 has yet to be determined. Each participant will receive a certificate of completion, a GEMS t-shirt, daily lunch, and families are invited to attend the closing reception at the end of the week. A limited amount of need-based financial assistance is available. Contact the Camp Director for more information.
