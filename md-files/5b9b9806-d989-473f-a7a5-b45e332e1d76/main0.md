**What Do Nashers Say About It?**

## “SNLP helped me find myself. There are people that want to listen to me here. I came to America from Nigeria last April, and people accept me for who I am here. I used to be afraid that I would be laughed at for my accent, but Nashers compliment me on it and ask me to teach it to them. Sadie Nash is a place for me.” — Nasher, Summer Institute
