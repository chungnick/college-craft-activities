# International Student FAQ 🌍

Each summer, students from around the world join us in New York City to explore their academic passions, build lifelong connections, and experience the vibrant culture of Barnard and the city that never sleeps.

This page is designed to answer your questions about eligibility, visas, program details, and life on campus. Whether you're wondering about application requirements or how we’ll support you during your time here, we’ve got you covered.

## General

### Am I eligible to apply to the program as an international student?

Yes, international students are eligible to apply, provided they meet the age and academic requirements of the program.

### Will I need a student visa to attend the Pre-College Programs?

**No.**International students in our non-credited programs are not required to hold a student visa in order to attend the Pre-College Program at Barnard. Since Pre-College students are only in class for up to 18 hours a week, and the program is less than 90 days, a student visa is not necessary.

**International students are not eligible to apply for the credit-bearing Pre-Baccalaureate program at this time.**

### If I don't need a student visa, what kind of visa would I need?

A visitor visa is required of international students in order to enter the country and participate in our exploratory programs. As published by the [U.S. Department of State,](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) a visitor visa (B-2) is required of any individual who takes a non-credit course in which classes are held for a short period of time.

It is recommended to apply for your visa as soon as you receive your acceptance letter and any supporting documentation from our office, as processing times can vary.

### Can the program assist me in obtaining a visa?

Our office can provide an official acceptance letter and other documentation if needed for your visa application, but you must handle the visa process yourself.

### Are there any exceptions to getting a visa?

**Yes.** If a student is traveling to the Pre-College Program from a visa waiver eligible country, they *may be* eligible to enroll in the Visa Waiver Program. **Please refer to the U.S. Department of State's page on [Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) for more information.**
