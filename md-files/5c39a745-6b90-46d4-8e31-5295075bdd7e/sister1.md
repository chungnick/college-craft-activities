# **Summer Scholars Program**

The UCI Blum Center Summer Scholars Program is open to high school students interested in gaining research skills in the fields of engineering and social ecology. Students will be guided by expert faculty to develop skills in plotting, visualization, trend analysis, programming, and spatial analysis with a specific focus on Orange County beaches, climate change and social impact.

This program will provide training relevant to admissions into engineering programs, including an introduction to MATLAB. Students will collect data, engage with experts in the field, and assemble their findings into dynamic, shareable portfolios.

For an example of student work, visit [OC Beaches](https://sites.google.com/iusd.org/ocbeaches/) – a dataset and report on how beaches have changed in Orange County over the past 20 years.
