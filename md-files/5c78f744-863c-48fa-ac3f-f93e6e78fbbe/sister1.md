#### **Application Period**

Thank you to our wonderful students and teachers for a fantastic 2024-25 academic year!

**Applications for the 2025-26 academic year have now** [**closed**](https://connect.nyu.edu/register/?id=93cd3688-8e2a-4078-97a8-d82acc9f955a)**.

#### **About the High School Law Institute**

The New York University High School Law Institute (“HSLI”) is a student-run organization that serves talented and motivated high school students throughout New York City. We offer free, yearlong academic programming in constitutional law, criminal law, and speech and debate on Saturdays from 10 AM to 1 PM.

Ideal HSLI students are those who recognize the impact of the legal system, wish to learn more about how it concretely impacts society, and are preparing themselves to serve and advocate for others. While there is no expectation that our students apply to law school or pursue a legal career, we do expect that they apply themselves diligently to their studies in high school and beyond.

Courses are taught by teams of current NYU Law students. Teachers receive thorough training prior to class and receive ongoing support throughout the year. They are also provided with detailed curricula created by veteran HSLI instructors and board members that are scaffolded to support high school student understanding. Each lesson contains discussion questions, background information, classroom activities, and homework assignments that can be tailored to fit each student’s interests. Our classes are discussion-driven and aimed at fostering independent thought. At HSLI, students are encouraged to think well, advocate well, and work collaboratively; they are also taught to evaluate arguments based on analytical rigor and strength of evidence.

Classes are held each Saturday from 10 AM to 1 PM. Dates for the **2025-26** fall and spring semesters can be found below:
