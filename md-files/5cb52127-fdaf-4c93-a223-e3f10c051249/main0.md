CORD offers three summer research experiences for high school students who are in their freshman, sophomore, junior or senior year. **The Summer Science Institute**(SSI), is a multi-summer program with a focus to build the next generation of scientists, SSI is sponsored by:

* UAB Center for Community OutReach Development (CORD)
* Birmingham City Schools (BCS)
* Private Donors

Summer Science Institute is a multi-summer research experience for high school students interested in learning what it is like to do “real” science. During the first summer in Fundamentals of Cellular and Molecular Biology (formerly Student BioTeach), students are offered a “smorgasbord” of short, 2-3 day, introductory molecular biology experiments. The following summer in Advanced Principles of Biology and Neurobiology (formerly ChemTeach) these same students are invited back to participate in extended, 5-6 day, more focused biochemical investigations on different aspects of a specific, biologically important protein. Finally, during the last summer as Student Research Interns, students are placed in a research laboratory to work on their own original project under the supervision of premier UAB faculty and staff.
