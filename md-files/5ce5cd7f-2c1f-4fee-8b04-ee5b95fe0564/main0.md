## Eligibility

In order to determine if VSA’s accelerated courses are a good fit, all students are required to submit qualifying documentation as part of their application.

**There are two eligibility documentation options. Below is a description of each option.**

Both options are considered equally when determining admission placements. Therefore, selecting one option over the other will not help or hurt a student’s chances of placement. All complete applications will be reviewed based on VSA’s admissions process and placement. Please carefully review the eligibility information below along with information about VSA’s admissions process and placement.

Please note, VSA does not compare one student to another in the admissions process. We review a student’s application in its entirety to ensure that the program will be a good academic fit for the student. Incomplete applications will not be considered in first-round reviews. If a student has participated in PTY programs before, a review of the student’s past academic performance and conduct while attending a program will be considered when determining placement.

| Eligibility Options Summary | **Applying with Test Scores** | **Applying with Portfolio** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test Scores | YES | - |
| Two Educator Recommendations | - | YES |
| Transcript | YES | YES |
| Resume | - | YES |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

### Eligibility Documentation Options

* Option 1: Submission of Test Scores

  Students applying to Vanderbilt Summer Academy who select this option should submit qualifying documentation at the time of application. Please note that test scores in the 90th percentile and above for age group in one or more sections on an advanced achievement assessment (ACT, SAT, PSAT) OR any other nationally normed standardized assessment (such as state testing, MAP/NWEA testing, ITBS, or ERB) suggests that VSA would be a good fit academically for a student. We also accept cognitive measures (i.e., WISC-V, CogAT, Otis Lennon, Stanford-Binet) and out-of-level test scores (i.e., ACT in 7th grade). Individual ability and/or achievement assessments from psychologists are also accepted. All pages of the individual evaluation and assessment need to be included. Test scores should be less than three years old.

  When reviewing scores and assessment reports, we look specifically at strengths and accelerated achievement in the content area(s) for selected course(s) of interest. For example, if a student is applying to a humanities course, the VSA team is looking at reading/writing/ELA test scores to determine fit. While PTY does not have cutoffs for standardized test scores in order to apply to the program, scores around the 90th percentile or above have the best chance of immediate placement if there is course availability. At the same time, please note that scores above the 90th percentile do not automatically guarantee admission into the program based on VSA’s priority window and randomized admissions process.

  *We ask that all students submit a transcript in addition to their test scores. This additional information can be useful when determining fit for the program when test scores are below the 90th percentile. We also ask that all students who apply for classes with prerequisites make sure that the transcript reflects the prerequisite qualifications. Transcripts can be submitted as a picture or screenshot of a student’s unofficial record but must include the student’s name and show grades for the 2024-2025 school year and the fall 2025 school year.\*\**

  If a student’s test scores fall significantly below the 90th percentile in the area of VSA course interest, students should select the portfolio option as this option provides additional information for VSA staff to use when determining if placement in the program would be a good academic fit.

  Students may submit a screenshot or picture of an assessment as long as the student’s name is visible on the test results. Please contact us at vsa.pty@vanderbilt.edu if you have questions concerning your test scores.
* Option 2: Portfolio

  At this time, VSA is currently allowing for an option that does not require test score submission to determine program eligibility.

  Please note, although selecting the portfolio option does not hurt a student’s chances of admission, VSA strongly encourages students to submit test scores (option 1).

  *Required Portfolio Components (3 Components):*

  **1. Transcript:** Grades of As and Bs in the academically advanced courses typically suggest that the VSA program would be a good academic fit. Through the transcript review process, we are looking for students who are highly motivated. PTY also understands that extenuating circumstances might impact a student’s grades or course options. Students should make sure to provide annotation if their grades or course options do not accurately demonstrate their ability and motivation to participate in an accelerated academic environment.

  *Transcripts can be submitted as a picture or screenshot of a student’s unofficial record but must include the student’s name and show grades for at least the 2024-2025 school year and the fall 2025 school year.*

  **2. Two Educator Recommendations:** Students should request recommendations from two educators (content area teachers or academic advisor) who can speak to the student’s academic ability well. Students should send their recommender the link below to complete the recommendation. When a student’s recommenders complete the form, the completed form will be automatically emailed to PTY. Please do not request that your recommenders write a letter or submit a recommendation in any method other than the following form. The form takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

  [https://pty.vanderbilt.edu/PTY\_educator\_recommendation/](https://redcap.vumc.org/surveys/?s=TALNPKKL79YHLA94)

  An application will not be considered complete, even though it may be marked as 100% in our application portal, until PTY receives two educator recommendations. It is the student’s responsibility to follow up with recommenders to confirm completion.

  *Can I request educators submit recommendations before a program application opens?*

  Educator recommendations can be submitted at any time. Before requesting educators complete the recommendation form, please create a SchoolDoc account (free) by visiting https://app.schooldoc.com/register/vanderbiltpty. As your educators submit recommendation forms, they will be internally associated with your account.

  *If I submitted educator recommendations for a previous PTY program application, do I need submit new recommendations for future PTY program applications?*

  You are not required to submit new recommendations if PTY has recommendations on file from the previous school year. We ask that you submit new recommendations if your previous submission is older than the previous school year. If we have current recommendations on file, you are welcome to request additional recommendations from educators who may be able to provide more recent assessments of your academic performance. Our admissions team may reach out to request additional recommendations depending on the content area of your top-ranked course or the date of your previous recommendations.

  **3. Resume:** Submit a one-page resume as part of your application, so the VSA admissions team has a better understanding of your interests and extracurricular activities. Knowing more about you helps VSA staff determine if this program is a good fit. The resume should include extracurricular activities, work/volunteer experience, awards, and honors, etc.

  The three portfolio components are reviewed together to determine whether VSA would be a good fit for a student. PTY will employ a holistic, context-aware review process to determine a student’s likely academic fit at VSA. Therefore, PTY recommends that students are thoughtful with their resume submission. Additionally, please be aware, all components of the portfolio, including educator recommendations, must be submitted for an application to be considered complete.

## Financial Assistance

Vanderbilt Programs for Talented Youth is committed to making programs available to academically gifted students regardless of a family’s ability to pay the full tuition. Therefore, need-based financial aid is available based on income. The VSA application review process is need-blind and does not consider financial status. More information on PTY’s financial assistance application can be found on the **[Tuition and Financial Assistance page](/pty/students/vsa/tuition/)**.
