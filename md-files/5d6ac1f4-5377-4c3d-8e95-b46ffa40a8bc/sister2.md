Teachers and counselors can send them directly to [academicconnections@ucsd.edu](mailto:academicconnections@ucsd.edu) or they can give them to the student to upload to their application. The application is incomplete without all of the required materials.

**Is there a minimum GPA that I need to be accepted into Academic Connections?** To be considered for admission to Academic Connections, students must have achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or better. While grades are one of the elements reviewed, students with a lower GPA will be considered based on their Teacher/Counselor Recommendation and/or extenuating circumstances.

**What is the curriculum like at Academic Connections?** Academic Connections offers classes that span many disciplines. Whether students are interested in Marine Biology, Journalism, Political Science, Engineering, Creative Writing, or Economics, to name just a few, there are classes offered that will match many interests.

**What is a typical day at Academic Connections like?** Academic Connections strives to balance a demanding academic schedule with engaging materials that go beyong just lectures. Classes are held 5 hours per day, Monday – Friday. On a typical day, Academic Connections students attend course lectures in the morning 9-11:30 AM, break for lunch, and participate in laboratories and study sessions in the afternoon 1:30-4:00 PM. Special activities include, but are not limited to: supervised field trips, SAT training (for an additional fee), and social events planned during the lunch breaks throuhgout the 3-week period.

**Are students permitted to be temporarily checked out of the program?**

The Academic Connections program is intense and offers a taste of the college experience. Not only will students be participating in classes and labs, but will also enjoy opportunities to participate in evening and weekend recreational activities. We expect interaction with other stu dents, Academic Connections instructors, RAs, and staff will prove to be rewarding both academically and socially. To help students fully enjoy all the educational and interpersonal opportunities at Academic Connections **visitation and checking students out will NOT be allowed**. We understand that students may have other academic, recreational, and religious commitments outside of Academic Connections, however students will only benefit by participating in the program in its entirety. No exceptions to this policy will be made.  
Parent(s)/guardian(s) who need to check-out their students for an emergency (e.g. death in family) need to email academicconecctions@ucsd.edu in advance and only those listed on authorization forms may check-out and check in students. All guests will need to show valid Government Issue ID.

**Who are the Academic Connections faculty and staff?** Academic Connections Research Studies faculty members are typically UC San Diego doctoral students who design and instruct their own courses. Class enrollment is limited to 25 and all classes with an enrollment of 12 or greater have the option of hiring a teaching assistant. The Academic Connections staff includes a Program Director, 2 Program Managers, and Program Assistant. 

**Can I get high school or college credit for Academic Connections attendance?** Each student who completes the program will earn six units of UC San Diego Extended Studies Pre-College credit. A transcript will be available on-line once the course is completed and grades received. An 'official' transcript to send for college applications can be ordered for an additional fee. Although most colleges will accept appropriate UC San Diego Extended Studies credits, the decision to accept the transfer of credits rests solely with the college you attend. Similarly, the decision to accept the units as part of a high school curriculum depends on each individual high school.

**What grading option should I select?**At UC San Diego Extended Studies, you have the option to choose how you want your course(s) graded.  Please note that Academic Connection courses are not part of a certificate program but the description for each still follows. 

* **Letter Grade:**A grade between A+ and F reflects your performance in the course and is included in your grade point average (GPA) calculation. A passing grade counts toward your earned credit hours or the required number of units for your certificate.

* **Pass/No Pass:** A grade of P or NP reflects whether you have passed the course, but does not otherwise indicate your performance. These grades are not included in your GPA calculation; however a P (passing) grade counts toward your earned credit hours or the required number of units for your certificate.
* **Not for Credit:** A grade of “NFC” reflects that you were enrolled in the course but does not indicate your performance. This grade appears on your transcript, but is not included in your GPA calculation and is not counted toward your earned credit hours or the required number of units for your certificate.

You will have the opportunity to select your grading option when you enroll in your course

The costs associated with these referrals are the responsibility of the student's family.
