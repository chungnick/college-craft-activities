SUMMER DEBATE PROGRAM

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the Yale Summer Debate Program?

The Yale Summer Debate Program is Yale's largest debate program held during the summer, and is open to middle school and high school students. Most students are from New Haven and surrounding areas, though we have welcomed students from across the country and world in recent years.

This five-day program offers students a rigorous, rewarding, and relevant debate experience. YSDP is built on the philosophy that debate is not just an activity, but is a set of skills students can use to critically engage with the world, no matter their interests, helping them to become better speakers, students, and most importantly, thinkers.

Our program is open to all students entering grades 6-12 of all levels; students with no prior experience to advanced debaters will find the program tailored but challenging. We work to accommodate all students, from middle school beginners to national debate champions.

​

### How can I join the program?

### Students must apply and be accepted to the Yale Summer Debate Program. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, and our application form can be found in the link below!

### ​

### What are the dates and times for this camp?

The Yale Summer Debate Program is tentatively scheduled to run the week of August 18-22, 2025. 

​

### When should I apply? When will I hear back?​

The deadline to apply is June 1, 2025. However, applications are accepted on a rolling basis, so students' applications will be evaluated as they are received. This means the camp could reach capacity before the June 1st deadline if there is exceptional demand. Therefore, students are encouraged to apply as soon as they are able, so they can ensure they receive a spot.

### 

### How much does this camp cost?

Students who attend New Haven Public Schools (or have an UDL program at their school) can attend YSDP at no cost. All other students can attend for $599. ​If this is a problem for any family, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRDdGI36JfBxji28ciu1og2Gwyy2ltZv5C4l6z1VZfDjMSr8Ay4cDMLsDAMu6r1vSOysmu78JAqAdSP/pub#h.yu151hl4tow) for more information on our generous financial aid policies.

​

### How old does my child need to be?

Students should be entering grades 6-12 in Fall 2025.

​

### What debate curriculum is taught?

We train in the parliamentary debate style, the most popular in the world (and the one used by top Connecticut tournaments like the Yale Invitational and Yale Osterweis tournaments). Even if students debate in other formats, such as Public Forum or Lincoln Douglas, they will still benefit from learning this method of debate, and becoming stronger speakers in the process. Our curriculum focuses on both parliamentary debate itself and the skills of research and argumentation that are universal among all debate formats.

Classes are taught by experienced Yale students, who often have significant experience coaching students during the school year. Students have the opportunity to form deep connections in small classes with 8:1 student-coach ratios.

​

### Should my student join this camp if they are new to debate? What if they’re a debate champion?

The Yale Summer Debate Program teaches students at all skill levels, from beginner to advanced. Students are separated into different classrooms based on their skill, so this program is a good fit for any student — of any debate background — interested in developing and challenging their speaking and debating skills. Our small student-coach ratio (historically 8:1 or less) means coaches have the freedom to work with students on an individual basis, offering feedback and advice, to improve in whatever areas they’d like. Students do not need any prior experience, just a willingness to learn and grow.

​

### I want to work on learning about X this summer? Will it be covered?

The Yale Summer Debate Program continuously changes its curriculum every year to focus on what students are interested in learning more about. If students indicate they want to focus more on a specific topic or skill while completing their application, please be sure to indicate such (there is a question on the application that pertains to this), and we will make sure we try to cover it during the week.

Students also have several opportunities to choose what they would like to learn about during the program as well. We offer multiple electives for students to choose from throughout the day, so students can customize what they’re learning about on an even deeper level.

​

### Is this camp offered online or in-person?

This camp is expected to be online for 2025.

​

### What if I cannot afford the price of camp?

The Yale Summer Debate Program is proud to offer a generous financial aid policy. All students at New Haven Public Schools and any school with a UDL program can attend the program for free. While the price of the program is $599 for all other students, please email [yalesummerdebateprogram@gmail.com](mailto:yalesummerdebateprogram@gmail.com) to apply for financial aid if this poses a challenge. Attending this program should place no burden on any family. Both full and partial financial aid is available depending on the situation.
