# H2O to Go Residential Summer Research Institutes

**FAU Pine Jog Environmental Education Center**
 has partnered with a select group of university, state, federal, and local agencies to offer unique, week-long, residential research institutes for high school students.

These programs introduce students to scientists who are working in the field of environmental research. Students work with research scientists and develop an understanding of the interconnectedness and complexity of South Florida water systems and the environmental issues facing them. Students are exposed to research tools engineered by FAU that are currently being tested as solutions to Florida’s environmental challenges. This program is designed to give students a professional experience not easily obtained by the general population and will provide a competitive edge, particularly to students interested in life science, engineering, oceanography, and research. Most importantly, students are guaranteed to have fun! Recreational activities such as boating, hiking, canoeing and netting are integrated throughout the learning activities.
