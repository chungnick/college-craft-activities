**Applications Due: March 21, 2026**

FAU Pine Jog Center is once again partnering with **FAU’s John D. MacArthur Campus at Jupiter, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute**, and **Riverwoods Field Laboratory** to offer a unique, week-long, residential research and field studies institute **for curent students in grades 9-11.** This institute, called **H2O to Go! Connections,** introduces students to scientists who are working in the field of environmental research. Students work with scientists and educators to develop an understanding of the interconnectedness and complexity of South Florida water systems and the environmental issues facing them. Students are exposed to research tools engineered by FAU that are currently being tested as solutions to Florida’s environmental challenges. This program is designed to give students a professional experience not easily obtained by the general population and will provide a competitive edge, particularly to students interested in life science, engineering, oceanography, and research. Outdoor and indoor recreational activities are integrated throughout the learning activities.

Students need to complete pre- and post-institute assignments during FAU’s summer session if they wish to receive dual enrollment credits for South Florida Hydrological Systems (SCE 4843) or a certificate of completion.

> "Enhancing the year round academic experience with a rigorous residential component offered by FAU, a local state university, is a replicable model for all states. It provides high school students their “next step” in understanding the opportunities to grow as a professional in a field and serves as an inspiration for learning."
>
> *-Mr. Christopher Hill, FAU Pine Jog Associate Director*
