## Transition School to Early Entrance

The Transition School (TS) is a distinctive one-year college preparatory program at the University of Washington. Designed for students who engage with learning at an advanced level, TS provides a pathway for early entry into the University as fully matriculated undergraduates through the Early Entrance Program. Students apply during their 8th grade year and participate in the Transition School during what would otherwise be their 9th grade year.

TS provides a rigorous and immersive academic environment designed for learners prepared to go beyond conventional educational pathways and frameworks. The curriculum emphasizes advanced critical thinking, interdisciplinary exploration, and deep conceptual engagement, encouraging students to synthesize ideas across fields and develop intellectual independence. Learning at TS is not just about mastery of content but about cultivating the ability to question, analyze, and innovate in ways that prepare students for success at the university level and beyond.

In addition to rigorous coursework, TS fosters a supportive learning community that helps students navigate the academic, social, and personal transitions of early university entry. The program values diversity and actively supports exceptional students from a wide range of backgrounds and communities, ensuring access to the resources and environment necessary to thrive in a rigorous academic setting.

### Recommendation for Transition School

"I love how TS provides a learning space with incredible instructors and staff, a rigorous yet supportive learning environment, and a group of passionate peers who feel more like family than classmates. It has allowed me to push what I had perceived as my academic limits and opened doors to opportunities I’ve never dreamed of before."

- Alexandra, TS Student
