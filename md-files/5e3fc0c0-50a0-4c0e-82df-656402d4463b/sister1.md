Started in 1977 and officially founded in 1980, Transition School provides a small cohort of high school aged students an opportunity to pursue an accelerated academic path.

The Transition School is a rigorous one-year college preparatory program that paves the way for the Early Entrance Program at the University of Washington. It focuses on developing the academic knowledge and personal skills essential for college success. Within a supportive community, students collaborate to advance their academic and personal goals, fostering both intellectual and personal growth.

Students apply during their 8th grade year and participate in the Transition School during what would otherwise be their 9th grade year.

Upon successfully completing the Transition School, students advance to become fully matriculated first year students at the University of Washington, accessing its extensive academic and student-life opportunities. Robinson Center students typically remain at the University for the entirety of their undergraduate studies.

#### "Transition School has created such a loving and welcoming classroom that supports every learner. There are countless resources here that you can't find anywhere else, all here to help you succeed; I truly feel part of a family that will always be here as I step into UW."

#### -Lizzy, TS Student
