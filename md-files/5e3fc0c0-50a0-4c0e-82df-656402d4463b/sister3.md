    * FAQs

#### How do I apply?

To apply, a student applicant first creates a profile in MyRC on the Robinson Center website and follows the prompts provided. Applications open Nov 14 and close Jan 15.

Please note the application is divided in two parts: 1) the student profile section which should be submitted immediately upon completion to officially open the application. This section can be completed in multiple sessions but cannot be edited once submitted and 2) the uploads section which includes middle school grade reports, ACT scores, and teacher e-recommendations which be continuously added to until the deadline. All required application components must be completed by the deadline: January 15, 5pm.

#### How many students apply and are accepted to Transition School?

Transition School receives a number applications each year.  After careful review of all completed applications, TS notifies those qualified to schedule an interview, accompanied by family, and a campus visit. If selected to interview, TS provides an additional writing prompt for the student applicant to complete and may conduct conversations by phone with one or more of the teachers who completed recommendations as a part of the application process. Ultimately, TS invites approximately 20 students to participate each year, and on average, 16-18 students accept and enroll.

#### What makes Transition School different from a traditional school experience?

Transition School is designed to serve young students who learn at an accelerated and advanced level. Accepted students enter the year-long Transition School program after completion of 8th grade to prepare for entrance into the University the following academic year. Throughout TS, students are expected to possess and demonstrate increasing capacity to be self-motivated, independent, and engaged scholars who are prepared to make the most of the University experience. The TS curriculum is not intended to replace the standard high school curriculum, nor does it bear much resemblance to AP or IB coursework. The focus is to prepare TS students to be strong scholars at the University.

#### How does Transition School lead to Early Entrance at UW?

Based on progress made during Transition School, TS leadership and instructors make recommendations for admission into the University as full-time undergraduates. No additional entrance exams are required. Following admission to the UW, Transition School students become Early Entrance Program students.

For current 10th grade students interested in early admission to UW without first attending Transition School, please visit the Robinson Center website for more information about the UW Academy program.

#### How are students supported during Transition School?

A variety of supports have been thoughtfully designed to guide students throughout their Transition School experience. In addition to coursework in math, science, English, and history, students participate in health and wellness class, attend instructional office hours, weekly whole group community meeting, and individual and small group tutorials. Each of these supports provide opportunities to identify and discuss social, emotional, and physical needs that contribute to a positive academic experience in the unique learning atmosphere afforded by TS.

#### What does a typical day at Transition School look like?

Admitted students attend classes at the Robinson Center on the University of Washington campus Monday – Friday. Class schedules vary some by quarter and the daily schedule is 8:30am-3:30pm. Students also attend an advisory meeting with an Instructor in which they discuss and develop study skills and habits. On a typical day, a student may attend class for three or four different subjects per day, as well as a combination of scheduled Office Hours, advisory, and/or meetings that occur throughout the week. 

The curriculum is fast-paced and in-depth, and classroom teaching emphasizes discussion over lecture. TS Instructors are experts in their fields, with advanced degrees and years of teaching experience. Teachers emphasize collaborative learning; it is vital to the success of the students that they develop a community among themselves and work together throughout the year. Social activities are also organized throughout the year to assist the students in developing and maintaining a close learning community.

#### What type of learner thrives at Transition School and in Early Entrance?

Students who benefit from Transition School and Early Entrance must be self-motivated, responsible, active learners, and collaborative peers. Although there are strong systems of support in TS, students must be able to make difficult decisions about their coursework and their academic career at a very early age. Other notable skills and dispositions include: intellectual curiosity of multiple subjects, consistently high achievement, strong organization and time management, demonstrated need for academic challenge, social maturity and aptitude, and ability to successfully navigate competing needs and deadlines.

#### What happens if a student does not advance from Transition School to the Early Entrance Program?

In the unusual circumstance that a student does not advance to Early Entrance from Transition School, TS guides the student and family in following the Academic Success Plan created during the application process and the student returns to the public, private, or homeschool program of choice.

#### Can I live in the dorms or participate in UW Clubs if I am admitted to Transition School?

No. Transition School is a  program offered to young scholars and located on the University of Washington Seattle campus. During Transition School, students are not considered fully matriculated University of Washington students and therefore are not permitted to participate in UW student activities, clubs, residential living, undergraduate research, or other extracurricular programs.

Upon successful completion of Transition School and admission to UW via the Early Entrance Program, a student is considered a traditional UW first-year and encouraged to explore the many sponsored campus activities and clubs available, with some exception pertaining to on-campus housing due to the young age of the student.

#### How much does Transition School cost?

Tuition for the 2026-2027 academic year will be $28,512. Tuition directly supports the individualized learning needs of Transition School students.

#### Are there scholarships available?

Yes. The Robinson Center is committed to ensuring that financial need is not a barrier to participation in Transition School. The RC offers financial assistance to students and families with a demonstrated need. Families who wish to apply for financial assistance must do so at the time of acceptance into the program. This requires a FAFSA be completed and submitted to the University of Washington’s Office of Financial Aid, with a copy sent to the Robinson Center. If a family is eligible for the Federal Free/Reduced Lunch Program, they may instead submit their most recent tax return and verification of eligibility for school meal program. A financial assistance committee, including the Director and selected Robinson Center staff, in consultation with the UW Financial Aid Office, will determine financial need and award amounts for each student. We encourage students for whom the costs entailed by application to Transition School (including the ACT and application fee) might represent a major impediment to contact the Robinson Center to inquire about exemption or financial assistance for these costs.

#### What are scholarly skills?

The curriculum of Transition School has been developed with several related goals in mind. First and foremost, the Robinson Center prepares TS students to be successful undergraduate students at the University of Washington. This requires not only providing a curriculum rich in content, but one that addresses the scholarly skills students will need to make the most of their University experience.  Scholarly skills include: a) consistently conducting oneself respectfully as a member of the learning community, b) demonstrating responsibility and preparation for one’s own learning, c) communicating effectively with peers and adults in multiple contexts across TS, and d) maintaining a growth mindset and willingness to receive feedback for improvement.

#### Is the ACT required?

No. ACT tests are just one of the criteria that can be submitted. Please see the full requirements [here](https://robinsoncenter.uw.edu/programs/transition-school/apply/).  The ACT contains multiple-choice tests in four areas: English, mathematics, and reading. The writing portion of the ACT is not required for the Transition School application. The science portion is optional but recommended. Given the age of Transition School applicants and the absence of a complete high school transcript, the ACT is used to assist in building a picture of an applicant’s academic readiness for college-level work. It is not expected that applicants prepare extensively for the ACT exam. At most, a student may wish to read through the practice test and become familiar with the test format. If Transition School is the right educational fit, most students are able to take the exam with little preparation. Scores in the 85th percentile or higher show potential readiness for college-level work. However, the Transition School Admissions Committee reviews applications with a holistic lens, so students applying with ACT scores below the 85th percentile are still encouraged to submit all materials for consideration. 

#### We are **committed to increasing access** and fostering student potential among students historically marginalized and excluded from advanced learning opportunities.

**Code:**When asked for a school code for the Transition School, enter either **481174** (if asked for a 6-digit code) or **9899** (if asked for a 4-digit code). The Transition School test code is different from the UW Seattle test code.

#### When should I take the ACT?

Students considering applying to Transition School can schedule their ACT over the summer after 7th grade or Fall of 8th grade. Test dates and registration information can be found [here](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration.html).

The September, October, and December test dates are highly recommended.

#### How can I request my academic history report (transcript)?

A written request from the TS student or parent is required for the release of a TS Academic History Report (transcript). Please allow up to 10 working days for processing your request.

#### What if I participate in home-based instruction (homeschool)? Can I still apply to TS? ?

Absolutely. Several homeschool students have successfully participated in Transition School and the Early Entrance Program.

Most all sections of the TS application remain applicable to a student who is currently participating in homeschool during 8th grade (the year they apply to TS). There is some adaption necessary when it comes to providing academic records and teacher recommendations; however, applications are welcome from all current 8th grade students.

**Students participating in home-based instruction (homeschool) should include the following document uploads in your TS application**:

1. A copy of your signed declaration of intent to homeschool for the current school year
2. Annual academic progress assessments for 6th, 7th, and 8th grades and any test scores (if applicable)
3. Three teacher recommendations

RCW 28A.225.010(4) defines instruction as home-based if it consists of planned and supervised instructional and related educational activities, including curriculum and instruction in the basic skills of occupational education, science, mathematics, language, social studies, history, health, reading, writing, spelling, and the development of an appreciation of art and music provided for a number of hours per grade level established for approved private schools and if such activities are provided by a qualified parent.

Chapter 28A.200 RCW states that each parent who is providing home-based instruction must:

1. File annually a signed declaration of intent that he or she is planning to cause his or her child to receive home-based instruction.
2. Ensure that test scores or annual academic progress assessment and immunization records, together with any other records that are kept relating to the instructional and educational activities provided, are forwarded to any other public or private school to which the child transfers.
3. Ensure that a standardized achievement test, approved by the State Board of Education, is administered annually to the child by a qualified individual or that an annual assessment of the student’s academic progress is written by a certificated person who is currently working in the field of education. The results of the standardized test or the annual academic progress assessment shall be made a part of the child’s permanent records. If, as a result of the annual test or assessment, it is determined that the child is not making reasonable progress consistent with his or her age or stage of development, the parent shall make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiency.

**What about submitting Academic Records or Progress Reports?**

1. If home-based instruction is provided by a parent per letter 'a' below 28A.225.010(4), please include letter grade or narrative documentation from the certificated person that details the learning objectives basic skills of occupational education, science, mathematics, language, social studies, history, health, reading, writing, spelling, and the development of an appreciation of art and music and how the student progressed in relation to the objectives and expected outcomes in these subjects in 6th and 7th grades, as well as progress to date in 8th grade.
2. If home-based instruction is provided by a parent per letter 'b' below 28A.225.010(4), please include letter grade report or narrative documentation from the parent (acting as teacher) that details the learning objectives basic skills of occupational education, science, mathematics, language, social studies, history, health, reading, writing, spelling, and the development of an appreciation of art and music and how the student progressed in relation to the objectives and expected outcomes in these subjects in 6th and 7th grades, as well as progress to date in 8th grade and documentation the parent as teacher meets the criteria of having either earned 45 college-level credit hours or the equivalent in semester hours or has completed a course in home-based instruction at postsecondary institution or a vocational-technical institute.
3. If home-based instruction is provided by a parent per letter 'c' below 28A.225.010(4), please include letter grade report or narrative documentation from the parent (acting as teacher) that details the learning objectives basic skills of occupational education, science, mathematics, language, social studies, history, health, reading, writing, spelling, and the development of an appreciation of art and music and how the student progressed in relation to the objectives and expected outcomes in these subjects in 6th and 7th grades, as well as progress to date in 8th grade and documentation the parent has been deemed sufficiently qualified to provide home-based instruction by the superintendent of the local school district in which the child resides.

RCW 28A.225.010(4) requires that the instructional and educational activities be:

1. Provided by a parent who is instructing his or her child only and is supervised by a person certificated under Chapter 28A.410 RCW. The supervision consists of and includes planning of objectives by the certificated person and the parent, a minimum each month of an average of one contact hour per week with the child being supervised by the certificated person, and evaluation of such child’s progress by the certificated person. The number of children supervised by the certificated person shall not exceed 30.
2. Provided by a parent who is instructing his or her child only and who has either earned 45 college-level credit hours or the equivalent in semester hours or has completed a course in home-based instruction at postsecondary institution or a vocational-technical institute.
3. Provided by a parent who is deemed sufficiently qualified to provide home-based instruction by the superintendent of the local school district in which the child resides

**What about Teacher Recommendations?**

A parent may complete a teacher recommendation while acting as the applicant's teacher. Many students who participate in home-based instruction also participate in cooperative learning groups, some in affiliation with a local public district. It is advisable that the second teacher recommendation be submitted by a non-parent who serves in a teacher role. The third recommendation already provides flexibility to be submitted by a non-family adult who supervises the students in an on-going capacity which may exceed the scope of traditional school subjects.

#### When do I select my UW classes and apply to a major?

It depends on the area of interest; however, typically at the end of the first or second year of UW but never during TS.

After a student is recommended for advancement from Transition School to the Early Entrance Program, the EEP Staff at the Robinson Center begins supporting newly admitted students to prepare for Advising & Orientation which happens during the summer after TS. During A & O, students will receive guidance in selecting classes for their first fall academic quarter.

Once enrolled as a matriculated student, students begin working with an Academic Advisor at the Robinson Center to follow the timelines and guidelines established independently by each academic program for admission to a particular [major](https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/). The University of Washington offers open majors (no requirements), minimum requirement majors, and capacity constrained majors. Being a Robinson Center student does not exclude students from being selected for admission to capacity constrained majors.
