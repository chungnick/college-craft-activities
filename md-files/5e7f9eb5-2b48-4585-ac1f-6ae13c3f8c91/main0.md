#### UCSF Fresno Summer Biomedical Internship

The Summer Biomedical Internship Program was established in 1988 to provide a quality biomedical research experience for high school students—the first of its kind in the San Joaquin Valley. The program matches high school students, in the summer between their junior and senior year of high school, with faculty members who have or are developing a research project. In the last twenty-seven years, over two hundred students have participated in the SBI program and many of them are finishing their medical residencies, are working in the biomedicine or biotechnical industries, or are in medical school or doctorate programs at various universities. Must meet eligibility requirements to apply.

#### SJV PRIME+ BS to MD Pathway

The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) PRIME + BS/MD program opportunity is an 8-year educational pathway partnership between UC Merced, UCSF Fresno, and UCSF. This critical pathway will educate and support the SJV’s future physicians in advancing health equity and the health of communities in the SJV. SJV PRIME+ is a 15-student cohort workforce development model for newly incoming, first-time freshman to become a doctor for the San Joaquin Valley of California. An SJV PRIME+ scholar completing this medical education pathway receives their medical degree (MD) from UCSF School of Medicine, after obtaining a Bachelor of Science from UC Merced and finishing medical training at UCSF Fresno. Students must apply during the Fall of their senior year of high school.

#### Raices (Roots) in the SJV (San Joaquin Valley)

Raices in the SJV is a grant-funded initiative by the Fresno-Madera K-16 Collaborative Project, designed to enhance educational and technical support in health pathways. Drawing on 25 years of experience, strong partnerships, and best practices, it aims to boost the healthcare workforce’s supply, diversity, and distribution. By addressing Social Determinants of Health—such as poverty, housing insecurity, limited access to higher education, and psychosocial challenges—it supports young people in the Central San Joaquin Valley in pursuing careers in healthcare.

#### Fresno County Health Youth Corps

The Health Youth Corps, launched in 2019 by UCSF Fresno, Fresno County Public Health, and the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools, empowers historically marginalized youth to be health champions in their communities. Students learn about social determinants of health, develop advocacy skills, and gain positive life experiences. Over two semesters, teams of high school students from across the county explore health and mental health topics, build resilience, and create community health projects. They present their work at an annual showcase for local leaders and can mentor the next cohort of students.
