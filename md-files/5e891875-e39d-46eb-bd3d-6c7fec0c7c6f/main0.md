# SpHERES High School Research Program

### Sparking High Schoolers' Excitement for Research in Engineering & Science (SpHERES)

SpHERES Scholars will work together with a research faculty member and mentors to complete a research project. In addition to this research experience, SpHERES Scholars will also gain more information about preparing for a career in medicine.

**Applications for the 2025 period are now closed.**

SpHERES is part of the [Young Scholars Summer STEMM Research Programs through the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering Program | UIUC (illinois.edu)](https://wyse.grainger.illinois.edu/summer-programs/young-scholars-summer-research).

## The SpHERES Program

**Please note the following** **Summer 2025 Young Scholars Dates:**

* In-person Orientation: June 17-18, 2025
* In-person Research Begins: June 20, 2025
* In-person Final Symposium: August 1, 2025

**Program Goals**

* Introduce students to clinically-focused research and promote health career opportunities
* Help students gain knowledge in a variety of STEM applications, innovation, entrepreneurship and holistic inclusive care
* Help students gain an understanding of the intersection of medicine, science, and engineering

**Student Benefits**

* Exposure to health career related research, clinical skills, innovation and entrepreneurship
* Pursue higher education goals
* Build your resume
* Get a taste of college life
* Gain professional development skills
* $2,400 summer stipend!

## As a SpHERES student, you will:

* Participate in an authentic research experience at a world-class research university using methods to make learning virtually come to life.
* Participate in weekly seminars on various topics including research projects, college readiness, innovation, entrepreneurship, holistic inclusive care and clinical skills.
* Become acclimated to a university setting and gain confidence in attending college.
* Receive multiple layers of mentorship, through faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students as well as medical students and physicians.

## What is the difference between the various summer high school programs? (SpHERES, GEnYuS)

All programs have the same goals and program structure. The difference is the research you will be doing in each program.

* SpHERES: If you are interested in a future healthcare career and engineering, innovation and or entrepreneurship, then the SPHERES program may be right for you!  You will be able to participate in research from departments across campus that include but are not limited to: Sociology, Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Neuroscience, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Bioengineering, Human Development and Family studies, Kinesiology,  and Micro & Nanotechnology Laboratory.
* GEnYuS – This program focuses on physics research. If you are interested in dark matter, lasers, or materials, then the GEnYuS program may be right for you.

Regardless of the program in which you are interested, you will be applying through the same application system. In your essay, you can discuss which program you prefer to attend. Be sure to mention “SpHERES” if you would like to be considered for our summer high school program.
