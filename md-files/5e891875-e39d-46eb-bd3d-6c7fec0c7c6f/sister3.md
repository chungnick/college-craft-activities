# Tuition, Fees + Scholarships

### BOT-approved Tuition + Fees

For more information on Board-of-Trustees-approved cost of attendance, please visit: [registrar.illinois.edu (See the Graduate and Professional information.)](https://registrar.illinois.edu/tuition-fees/tuition-fee-rates/tf-rates-term/)

### Scholarships

Carle Illinois uses funding from institutional sources and philanthropic support to provide scholarship funding to a limited number of matriculating students to help defray the cost of medical school.

The Scholarship Subcommittee of the Admissions Committee is charged with determining the metrics used to select and award scholarship funding to the incoming class of Carle Illinois students, on an annual basis.

The Subcommittee uses a holistic review that looks at various factors. There is not a single defining characteristic that makes someone eligible for scholarships as the guidance and needs of Carle Illinois, Carle Health, and the Champaign-Urbana community change yearly.

All students are considered for scholarship funding.

To be eligible for other forms of aid, such as federal financial aid, students must complete the [Free Application for Federal Student AID (FASFA)](http://www.fafsa.gov), using our school code of 001775, as well. Additional information regarding the financial aid process is available below.

## FAQ

[How much does a medical education cost at your school?](#panel_24594_0)

Tuition and fees are typically approved by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees at their January meeting. The Office of Student Financial Aid uses this information to determine the Cost of Attendance for all Illinois students. Cost of attendance information is available at [cost.illinois.edu](https://cost.illinois.edu).

[Is a supplemental financial aid application required at this school?](#panel_24594_2)

No, the Free Application for [Federal Student AID (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) is the only application required.

[Do you require parental information to determine a financial aid award package?](#panel_24594_3)

No, only student information is required on the FAFSA.

[What scholarships and grants are available and when can I apply for them?](#panel_24594_4)

All admitted students are automatically considered for merit scholarships–no application required! To be considered for all other financial aid, students must complete the [Free Application for Federal Student AID (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa).

[If I get a scholarship for one year, will it continue to be offered in subsequent years?](#panel_24594_5)

Yes. All scholarships offered to incoming students are automatically renewed for a total of four years as long as you remain in good academic standing.

[Does your school offer institutional loans? If you do, what are the terms and conditions of my yearly cost will they cover? Are they awarded each year?](#panel_24594_6)

No, institutional loans are not available to students in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Students who file the FAFSA will be considered for Federal Unsubsidized and Grad Plus loan options. Students have the option of securing loans through private sources if additional funding is needed. Additional information is available at [osfa.illinois.edu](https://osfa.illinois.edu/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans/alternative-educational-loans/).

[How can I cut down on my yearly expenses, costs, and borrowing?](#panel_24594_7)

Take advantage of Illinois Human Resources money management resources and [Financial Wellness Programming](https://humanresources.illinois.edu/campus-wellbeing-services/Partners/Financial-Wellness-Pro.html) offered through University of Illinois Extension.

[Do students who are awarded the AAMC’s Fee Assistance Program qualify for any additional financial aid benefits at your school?](#panel_24594_8)

No, no additional benefits are offered through the Office of Student Financial Aid.

[Can medical students work part-time while attending your school?](#panel_24594_9)

Our medical school program will demand a significant amount of your time. As such, a part time job is strongly discouraged.

[Does the cost of attendance increase annually?](#panel_24594_10)

Carle Illinois College of Medicine does not offer fixed-rate tuition. As such, students may experience a slight increase in cost over the duration of their studies. Tuition and fees are approved annually by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees, typically at their January meeting. For students who have received Carle Illinois scholarships, the Scholarship Committee reserves the right to increase scholarships accordingly.
