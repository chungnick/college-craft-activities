# Young Scholars

Consistent with Clarkson's overall focus on interdisciplinary education, you will be given a problem to examine and solve from multiple perspectives including technical feasibility, the implications of health care and larger social implications. Students will work with faculty from a number of disciplines including engineering, business, applied math and education.

Working individually and in small groups, you conduct research and make a final presentation. Your families are also encouraged to attend the final presentation.  This unique program sparks intellectual development and requires you to exercise strong communication skills and cooperative problem solving.
