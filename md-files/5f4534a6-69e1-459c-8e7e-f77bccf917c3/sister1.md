# ABOUT

Research Scholars– Marine Science, offered through the Education and Community Outreach Department (ECO) at UC San Diego, Division of Extended Studies (DES), provides a streamlined opportunity for high school students to learn about the marine environment. We currently offer online and in-person courses at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at Ted and Jean Scripps Marine Conservation and Technology Facility (MCTF) in partnership with the Aburto Lab. This program is unique because it gives high school students the foundation and tools to conduct real science in the field, empower students to create public facing projects, be advocates for their communities, and connect with peers from all over the world. It is our hope to prepare students in areas of real-world problem-solving skills, increase equity in STEM fields, and inspire the next generation of ocean stewards.

## Marine Science Education

#### Youth Experiences

We offer pre-college credit in-person and online courses for high school youth and recent graduates on topics that range from thermal ecology to the molecular biology of marine life.

## Active Research

#### Youth Experiences

We engage in active research and collaborate with current Scripps Institution of Oceanography graduate students and alumni to design and participate in unique projects.

## Outreach and Communication

#### Youth Experiences

Youth that participate in our in-person programs engage with the public at Birch Aquarium and Cabrillo National Monument, sharing their research and projects to a wide audience ranging from Pre-K all the way to adults.

## PROGRAM GOALS

1. Increase interest in marine science careers through authentic, place-based research experiences
2. Connect Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) graduate students, professors, research affiliates, and alumni to mentorship and community engagement opportunities with research scholar students
3. Inspire and support the next generation of ocean stewards and advocates for their community by engaging in science communication
4. Increase diversity and representation in STEM fields by providing access to ECO Pre-College Programs through scholarships to support high school from low income, first-generation and foster youth backgrounds in San Diego Region

# PARTNERS

## CENTER FOR MARINE BIODIVERSITY & CONSERVATION

The Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation (CMBC) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego is a hub for interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and protecting our planet. We are part of the **[Sustainable Seafood Initiative (SSI)](https://cmbc.ucsd.edu/sustainable-seafood-initiative/)** that focuses on the intersection of sustainable fisheries management with seafood supply systems. We partner with the SSI at CMBC to bring seafood sustainability education to Research Scholars, Marine Science youth.

## ABURTO LAB

Octavio Aburto is a professor and research scientist at Scripps Instution of Oceanography (SIO), National Geographic Explorer, and a professional photographer associate with the International League of Conservation Photographers (iLCP). In-person courses are held at the Aburto Lab in the Marine Conservation and Technology Facility (MCTF).

## CONSERVATION LEADERSHIP

The [Conservation Leadership Program](https://liderazgoenconservacion.org/) aims to empower young people in coastal communities to lead collective actions for *sustainable prosperity* and the *conservation of natural resources*. Led by Dr. Octavio Aburto, the Program reflects Walter Munk’s ***vision of community-driven conservation***, inspired by the success of Cabo Pulmo’s reef restoration efforts. With a network of seasoned practitioners from Mexico and the U.S., this initiative brings together diverse expertise to foster cross-border collaboration in marine conservation.
