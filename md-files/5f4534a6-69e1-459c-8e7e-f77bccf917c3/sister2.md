# Transcripts

## Grade Reports

To view and print a copy of your enrollment confirmation or unofficial grade report, log into [MyExtension](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/) and navigate to the “My Documents” tab.

## Transcript Requests

**Order your transcript online:**  

We are proud to partner with Parchment to offer you a secure way to order your transcript online. It's quick, easy to use, and available 24/7.   
  
[ORDER YOUR TRANSCRIPT](https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/26942956/account)  
  
If you've never ordered transcripts through Parchment before, you will need to register for a Parchment account. Just follow the link above and then click "create account". Please note: if you have created an account with us prior to 10/27/2022, due to a system upgrade, you will need to create a new account.   
  
All transcript orders that are submitted to Parchment will be automatically marked as "on hold"  in the system because they must be manually processed by our staff. Unless you select the "hold for grades" option or you are contacted by our office about the hold specifically, your transcript will be processed in the order that it was received in accordance with our standard processing times.

### Professional Development Institute:

If you are a PDI student and have completed a course within the past 3 weeks, please check your MyExtension before placing your order to make sure your enrollment information is up to date. Transcripts will be printed with all coursework that is listed in your MyExtension at the time of ordering. If you have purchased university credit and do not see your course, please contact [unex-pdi@ucsd.edu](mailto:unex-pdi@ucsd.edu). 

**Other Ordering Options**  
For check payments only: submit a Transcript Request Form, along with full payment:

* In person or by mail to either [Student Services location](/about-us/locations)

A transcript held for pick up will be held for 60 days after you have been notified that it is available for pick up. If not picked up within that 60 day window, the transcript will be mailed to the address on file in your student record.

If you need a replacement for a transcript not successfully delivered or not picked up after the 60 day window, you will be  
required to submit a new transcript request and pay any associated transcript fees.

## Lived Name

In compliance with UC Gender Recognition and Lived Name initiative, UC San Diego Extended Studies offers students the ability to list their lived name via their MyExtension student portal. In doing so, only your lived name will be available to non-specialized staff and instructors. While your lived name will be used for all forward-facing documentation, your transcript of record with Extended Studies will display your *legal name*. UC San Diego Division of Extended Studies may also disclose your legal name for consented 3rd party verifications or where legal names are required by law, industry standard or legitimate business needs.
