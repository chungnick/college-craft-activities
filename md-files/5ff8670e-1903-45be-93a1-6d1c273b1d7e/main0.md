# Discovering Engineering

Spend a week on campus working in our engineering facilities and learning more about the amazing things you can do as a Maryland Engineer!

# Please stay tuned for Discovering Engineering Summer Program 2026 updates coming in February!

## The Academic Program

During the week, you will have an opportunity to explore Maryland Engineering!  You will participate in a variety of activities including laboratory work and demonstrations, lectures, discussions, computer instruction, and a team design project. You will visit each of the eight engineering departments to learn more about the specific [degree programs](/eng.umd.edu/degree-programs), majors, and minors. Within the network of support provided by the instructors, program advisors, and peers, you will have the opportunity to build self-confidence in applying your math, science, and engineering skills.
