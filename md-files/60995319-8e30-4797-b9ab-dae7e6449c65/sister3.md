# International Students

[Pre-College Summer Residential Program](/admission-aid/pre-college-programs/summer-residential-program) / International Students

### **Welcome. Καλωσόρισμα. 欢迎. Bienvenido. 환영. hoan nghênh.**

Interested in spending the summer studying in the United States on a college campus overlooking the New York City skyline?  Then come to a Pre-College Program at Stevens! Offering programs in Engineering, Science, Technology, Business, Society & the Arts, all of our programs are carefully designed by our faculty to be creative, project-driven, hands-on immersions that give you not just real college experience, but real world experience too. By night you’ll live in the residence halls with other international and American students, and by day you’ll visit major corporations, work on a tangible projects and learn alongside experts.

## Program Pairing

Many of our international students choose to participate in more than one program during the summer, to make the most of their time here in the United States.  We offer 1-week and 2-week programs over the course of 4 weeks each summer – pair as many programs as you like as long as the program dates don’t overlap! If you need assistance building out your stay at Stevens, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea999f87878f98aa999e8f9c8f8499c48f8e9f).

## Application Documents

* Complete the Stevens Summer Application Online.
* Upload a 500-word personal statement. Help us get to know you and explain why you are interested in attending the pre-college program you’ve selected. \*Mandatory if you are applying for financial aid\*
* Upload your high school transcript.
* Upload a letter of recommendation from a teacher. \*If applying to the ECOES program, the letter of recommendation must come from a science or math teacher.\*
* Upload a copy of your TOEFL, IELTS, PSAT or SAT scores, if possible

## Language Proficiency

If English is not your first language, we do not require the TOEFL as part of your application; however, students who participate in our Pre-College programs must have full proficiency in English – listening, speaking, writing and reading – in order to be successful in our programs. To get a better idea, if you decide to apply to Stevens for Undergraduate study, you are required to demonstrate English proficiency with one of the following:

* IELTS (minimum 6 overall)
* SAT I Critical Reading (minimum 550)

## Visa

Stevens Institute of Technology does not issue Form I-20 for the purpose of attaining F-1 visa status to summer program participants.  Students wishing to participate in the summer program may either attain a B-2 tourist visa to participate in a short course of study which is recreational, and less than 18 hours per week, or be a citizen or national of a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).  Please note that under the Visa Waiver Program, you must first have a valid Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval before you travel.  Citizens of Canada and Bermuda generally do not need tourist visas to enter the U.S.  To help facilitate the B-2 visa application process, you may contact the Office of Pre-College Programs at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e695938b8b8394a695928390838895c8838293) to request a program information letter to accompany your application for a B-2 visa.

## Travel

Students are responsible for covering their own travel costs.  However, for students traveling by air to Newark Liberty International Airport, a staff member from Stevens Institute will be waiting at the airport to greet you and provide transportation to Stevens at no additional cost to you!
