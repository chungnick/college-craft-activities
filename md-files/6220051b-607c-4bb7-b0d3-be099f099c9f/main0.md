In the application portal, you must list and upload unofficial transcripts for all post-secondary institutions you have attended full-time for at least one term.

Upon submission, before your application can be considered complete and ready for evaluation, you must submit **official transcripts** from your institution. For Indian universities, this includes all semester mark sheets. If your university provides transcripts in a language other than English, both the original language document and English translation are required.

Admissions staff will carefully review these official translations for accuracy and authenticity, and investigate any credentials that seem suspect if a student is being considered for admission. 

All applicants must submit certified and secure electronic transcripts directly from their institution or via the vendor that provides that service for their institution to transcripts [[at]] sps [[dot]] columbia [[dot]] edu. Documents can take at least 7–10 business days to verify for an application record. 

If your institution does not issue electronic transcripts, please submit all post-secondary coursework and credentials (undergraduate and graduate, if applicable) to [World Education Services, Inc.
