### Visiting Students FAQ

Expand All

### Are there online classes?

Courses will note modality once finalized by the academic department.

### Where can I find a list of available courses?

[Courses open to Summer Visiting students can be found here](https://summer.sps.columbia.edu/academics/find-courses-interest). Students in the Arts in the Summer program [can find available courses here](https://summer.sps.columbia.edu/academics/arts-summer).

### Does admission mean I have a spot in the class?

No. Upon admittance into a Summer Session program, **you must****first accept your offer.** **Then you must** complete the necessary Next Steps in order to register. Failure to complete the Next Steps (i.e., activate UNI, submit admissions verification documentation, etc.) will prevent students from adding courses to their schedule.

### What is the difference between Arts in the Summer and the general Visiting program?

Students admitted to the Arts in the Summer program can enroll in film, theater, writing, and visual arts classes. Students also interested in taking a course outside these four subjects should apply to the Visiting Student program, pending eligibility.

### I only applied for Session A. Can I continue taking courses in Session B?

Students in Session A can continue taking courses in Session B. Please connect with your advisor to learn more. A new application is not needed.

### Can I continue to take courses in the fall after my summer term ends?

Visiting students are permitted for a maximum of three terms (continuation into the next term is contingent upon successful completion of the previous term and advising approval). Please connect with your advisor to learn more. A new application is not needed.

### Do Summer Session Visiting Students have access to the same resources as academic year Columbia students?

Visiting students have access to the same resources as all CU Student ID holders, such as University libraries, on-campus events, and, if applicable, dining halls and dormitories.

### How do I know if I need a visa?

People admitted to study at Columbia University who are not United States citizens or permanent residents must be a full-time student at Columbia—registered for at least 6 points of credit-bearing courses in a 7-week session or 12 points of credit-bearing courses in the entire 14-week summer period—in order to be eligible for a student (F-1) visa.

### If I am already on a student visa, do I still have to meet the point requirements for international students?

If you are on a student visa with another U.S. institution, you should check with that institution’s International Student Services Office to confirm the requirements.

### Are there non-credit options for classes? / Can I take a non-credit class to forgo the visa requirement?

There are a few non-credit courses in the summer; however, the majority of classes are for-credit. Please review the course pages to check the course credits. Students on a Columbia sponsored visa cannot take a non-credit class to forgo the 6-point visa requirement.
