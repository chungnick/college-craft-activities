# Quantum School for Young Students

Discover how mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering and more combine into one of the most exciting topics in modern science – quantum information – at the Quantum School for Young Students (QSYS).

The Quantum School for Young Students (formerly the Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students) is a unique enrichment program for high-school students hosted by the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo.

QSYS offers a blend of expert lectures, group discussions, problem-solving, mentoring and networking with world-leading quantum researchers.

Join hundreds of like-minded students to explore the quantum future! At QSYS, you will:

* Learn how the world works at the quantum level
* Understand phenomena like quantum superposition and entanglement
* Discover how quantum technology will transform computing and cryptography
* Connect with a network of motivated students

[*→* Hear QSYS alumni share their experience](#alumni)

[*→*Read recap stories from QSYS 2025 and 2024](#news)

QSYS 2026 will take place online from **August 4 to 13, 2026**, with an optional in-person lab day for students from the Waterloo region on **Monday, August 17, 2026**.

## What's QSYS like? - Hear from alumni

I think the best thing is the amount of exposure you get to both the theoretical and experimental sides of quantum physics. You really get to work with the mathematics and explore all the technology that's hopefully going to become more commonplace soon.
Jaedon Thileepan

My favourite part of QCSYS was attending the ask-a-researcher sessions where we got to learn about what is currently being researched in the field of quantum technology and interact with the people behind it that are revolutionizing our future.
Mia Isakovic

I think my favorite part about QCSYS was the problem sets. I got to do math that I wouldn't have otherwise had the chance to do and the lectures were absolutely wonderful, so informational and so much fun.
Madi Schuetze

We got the chance to ask researchers about their work to better familiarize ourselves with it, which really brought these topics to life and made me even more interested and inspired by their passion.
Mia Isakovic

My favorite part was observing different types of polarizers and lasers. I enjoyed working with other talented individuals from around the world plus being able to understand what quantum cryptography is and how it can be applied in real life situations.
Karissa Sonoo

I've been interested in quantum computing and quantum technologies for awhile but I haven't found this resource as good as QCSYS to really teach me all the concepts. The lecturers, organizers, and all the students were all really helpful in my journey.
Angeline Lafleur

I was amazed by the awesome community. They were so engaged, smart, funny, and everything in between. I would definitely recommend this program if you want a fun challenge.
Adriana Ceric

It was fascinating to explore topics such as quantum key distribution and the quantum eraser, and I was able to ask my questions to lead researchers and experts in the field. This is also an epic way to meet new friends with similar interests.
Elena Yang

You will be exposed to a lot of topics that you didn't even know existed.QCSYS gives you enough knowledge on each topic that you can self study in the future.
