# QSYS Frequently asked questions

The [Quantum School for Young Students (QSYS)](/institute-for-quantum-computing/outreach/qsys), previously  known as the Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students (QCSYS), will run virtually in 2025 and is open to students across Canada. An in-person lab day for students in the Waterloo region will be held in addition.

Have questions? You will find the answers below. If you have further questions, please email [iqc.qsys@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:iqc.qsys@uwaterloo.ca)

## Application

Expand all
Collapse all

## WHAT IS THE DEADLINE FOR APPLYING?

Applications are due Sunday, June 8 2025 at 11:59 p.m. ET.

## WHAT DO I NEED TO INCLUDE ON MY APPLICATION?

In addition to information about yourself, you will need to submit a short essay (1 page maximum) describing why you are an ideal candidate for QSYS.

## HOW ARE THE QSYS APPLICATIONS RANKED?

QSYS applications are ranked in a variety of categories, including the quality of your reference, scientific and scholarly interests, extracurriculars, leadership, enthusiasm, and motivation.

## I FOUND OUT ABOUT QSYS AFTER THE DEADLINE, CAN I STILL APPLY?

Unfortunately no. Applications are required to be on time in order to be considered.

## CAN I LOG IN AND CHANGE INFORMATION ON MY APPLICATION?

No. Once your application is submitted you cannot change it. Please be sure to review your application before you submit.

## Admissions

Collapse all

## CAN I STILL APPLY IF I AM CURRENTLY IN GRADE 12?

Yes. If you are currently in Grade 12 and you are attending university or college in the fall 2025 you are still eligible to attend the Quantum School for Young Students (QSYS). Students in a pre-university program, such as CÉGEP in Quebec, are also eligible.

## CAN INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ATTEND QSYS?

The live sessions of QSYS 2025 are only available to students within Canada. Interested participants from outside Canada can [fill out the online form](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/form/qsys-2024-virtual-lectures) to receive recordings and materials from QSYS 2025 after the program concludes.

## HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED INTO THE PROGRAM?

Approximately 200 students will be accepted to the online program.

## WHEN WILL I HEAR IF I HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED?

We will email the results by Tuesday, July 8, 2025. We will contact all applicants to let them know if their application was successful or not.

## CAN I REQUEST FEEDBACK ON MY APPLICATION IF I DIDN'T GET ACCEPTED?

Unfortunately, due to the volume of QSYS applications we receive each year, we are unable to provide individual feedback on any application. Each year, we receive many very strong applications, but due to the limited number of open spaces in the program, we are unable to accept every qualified applicant. This means that your application may still have been strong, despite not being accepted.

We encourage you to continue being curious and learning about quantum information. [Sign up for our mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/c0abe3c1efcb/jojlku4blh) to learn about our next upcoming quantum learning opportunities.

## Financial

## IS THERE A COST TO ATTEND QSYS?

There is no registration fee for QSYS 2025. Lunch will be provided for the in-person lab day, but students are responsible for their own transit costs.

## Scheduling conflict

## I HAVE A SCHEDULING CONFLICT. CAN I MISS A DAY OF QSYS?

Virtual sessions will be recorded and posted online within 24 hours. To obtain a certificate of participation, students must attend at least 75% of the live sessions.

## In-person lab day

* What is the in-person lab day?
  + The in-person lab day is a full day of hands-on activities where students can work with real quantum equipment. It will take place Monday August 18.
* Can I travel to attend the in-person lab day?
  + The in-person lab day is only open to students within the Waterloo Region. No overnight accommodations are available for students.
* Can I attend the in-person activities remotely?
  + The in-person activities will not be remotely accessible or live-streamed in any way.
* How many students will be accepted for the in-person day?
  + Up to 25 students will be invited to attend the in-person lab day. Acceptance to the virtual sessions does not guarantee acceptance to the in-person day.
* Where will the in-person day take place?
  + The in-person lab day will take place on-campus at the University of Waterloo. More information will be sent to successful applicants.
* Do I need to be 18 to attend the in-person activity?
  + If you are under 18, you will require permission forms signed by your parent or legal guardian to attend the in-person day.
* Are there costs for the in-person day?
  + You are responsible for your own transit to the University of Waterloo campus. There are no fees and we will provide lunch for the day.

The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the [Office of Indigenous Relations](https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous).
