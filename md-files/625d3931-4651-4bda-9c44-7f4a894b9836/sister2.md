# Quantum School for Young Students 2026

Tuesday, August 4, 2026
-
Thursday, August 13, 2026
(all day)

[iCal](/institute-for-quantum-computing/events/ical/4008)

Discover how mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering and more combine into one of the most exciting topics in modern science – quantum information – at the Quantum School for Young Students (QSYS).

QSYS is a free enrichment program for high-school students that offers a blend of expert lectures, group discussions, problem solving, mentoring, and networking with world-leading quantum researchers.

Join hundreds of motivated students to explore the quantum future!

## At QSYS, you will:

* Learn how the world works at the quantum level
* Understand phenomena like quantum superposition and entanglement
* Discover how quantum technology will transform computing and cryptography
* Connect with a network of motivated students

Students in the Waterloo region are invited to apply for an in-person lab day on **Monday, August 17**. Enter the Quantum Exploration Space, meet active quantum researchers, and work with real quantum equipment like entangled photon sources, spin qubits and interferometers. Space for the in-person lab day is limited.

Applications for QSYS are due Friday, May 1, 2026.

## Sessions

* **Monday, August 4** - **Thursday, August 13**
  + QSYS 2026's eight live online sessions will be held every day.
* **Monday, August 17**
  + The in-person lab day will be hosted on the University of Waterloo campus at the [Research Advancement Centre](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/join-the-quantum-journey/iqc-locations-directions-and-parking) (RAC) for participants in the Waterloo region.

## Eligibility

You are an ideal candidate, if you are:

* a Grade 11 or 12 student in Canada  (e.g., Secondary V and CÉGEP in Québec),
* curious and interested in exploring scientific concepts,
* have enrolled in or completed Grade 11 mathematics (Grade 11 physics is recommended), and
* fluent in English.

Experience with quantum physics is not required, just curiosity and interest in exploring new scientific concepts. Exceptional Grade 10 students may be accepted, space permitting.

Due to high demand, we are only able to offer admission to the live sessions to students within Canada. 

## Cost

There is no registration fee for QSYS 2026. Lunch will be provided for the in-person lab day, but students are responsible for their own transit costs.

## Location

QSYS 2026 will be hosted online and can be accessed from anywhere in Canada. Successful applicants will need to ensure they have a reliable internet connection.

The in-person lab day will be hosted on the University of Waterloo campus for participants in the Waterloo region.

The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the [Office of Indigenous Relations](https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous).
