### Health and Safety

To address issues of health and safety, and the guidelines set by the Governor, the OHA, and OSU, we have created [protocols that will be put into place for our camp program](https://stemacademy.oregonstate.edu/policies-and-procedures). If the Oregon Health Authority or OSU issues different guidelines as the spring and summer progress, we will adjust our camp protocols accordingly.
