## Policies and Procedures

### STEM Academy Camp Protocols and Requirements

Our program activities, measures, and protocols are subject to change based on executive order, other legal requirements, health authority guidance, or local conditions. As always, our office follows university guidelines and policies. The university, and our Precollege Programs office, will be ready to adjust measures and operations when doing so could yield improved outcomes.

### Grade Level Designation

If registering for a school-year program, grade level designation is for the grade in which your child is currently enrolled. For summer, it will be the grade your child will be in the fall.

For example: If it is May and your child is currently in 6th grade, the summer  
grade level would be 7th grade.

### Emergency Contacts and Additional Pick-Ups

Individuals listed in the the registration system as Emergency Contacts or authorized individuals listed as Additional Pick-Ups must be 18 years or older. Minors are not allow to fulfill these functions for any STEM Academy activity.

### Accommodations Requests

If your participation in a STEM Academy activity requires an accommodation related to a disability, please contact the STEM Academy office at least three weeks (21 days) before the date of the activity. While many accommodations do not need much lead time to implement, some require weeks of lead time so we can fully prepare and train our staff. We will make every attempt reasonable to provide accommodations requested after this deadline, but cannot guarantee they will be in place by the start of the activity.

### Online Registration System

To register for any camps, [please use our online system](http://apps.ideal-logic.com/stemacademy). To finalize the registration process, you must click on the green submit button. The payment is due when you register.  You may pay online with credit/debit card or mail a payable check to STEM Academy at OSU. We will provide two weeks for the check to arrive in our office, after which we reserve the right to cancel the registration and open the spot to the next participant.

**Our mailing address is:**

### Tuition Assistance

STEM Academy is committed to making it possible for any interested student to participate in camps regardless of his or her financial situation. Up to $320 per term is awarded to qualifying students on a sliding scale, based on family income and circumstances. The application is simple and confidential.

A copy of the tuition assistance form is available to print from the online registration system or by clicking the link below. You are required to submit the form to us via e-mail or through the postal system with the documentation required within two weeks of registering for an activity. Once we process your request, we will contact you with information on how much tuition assistance we can provide to the student.  If you agree to the amount of the scholarship, we will apply it to the registration and the remaining amount to be paid by your family will become due at that time.  When we apply the final payment, you will receive an e-mail receipt.

### Payment Plans

Should you be experiencing financial difficulties, but are not eligible for the Tuition Assistance, we may be able to set up a payment plan on a case by case basis.  Please contact our office at (541)737-8139 or at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5d6d1c0c88bc4c6c4c1c0c8dce5cad7c0c2cacbd6d1c4d1c08bc0c1d0) if you need to discuss this option.

### Required Attendance

It is expected that those receiving tuition assistance will attend all sessions of the program they are registered for.  Scholarship money is very limited and we need to ensure that it is being used effectively.  Should a scholarship recipient miss sessions of a program, it may effect their ability to receive additional scholarships in the future.

### Program Expectations

STEM Academy programs are open to everyone. Participants come with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and relevant experience. Our programs are for all interested and motivated students who are willing and able to participate in class. Please let us know in advance if your student has special learning needs. Our instructors make every attempt to provide a successful learning experience for all students. Disruptive students or students who are unwilling to participate in class will be withdrawn from class and no refund will be given.

### Cell Phone Use Policy:

* Participants should not have phones out during camp activities, unless specifically asked to do so by camp staff. Cell phone use during breaks is permitted. An exception to this policy is if access to a personal cell phone is part of the participant's accommodation plan.
* Staff should not use cell phones during camp for non-camp purposes, unless it is an emergency. Staff should keep cell phones available so that camp staff can connect when needed.
