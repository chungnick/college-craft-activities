## Lab Techniques in Biotechnology

Our goal in this program is to introduce motivated high school students to the techniques
and equipment used in modern biotechnology research to establish a strong foundation
for future research endeavors.

| **Dates:** | July 13-17, 2026 |
| **Application Deadline:** | May 1, 2026 |
| **Application Instructions:** | Student fills out Applicaton Form (see below).  Teachers fill out Recommendation Forms (see below).  Students need to share the link to this page with the teachers who need to fill out their recommendation forms. |
| **Cost:** | $700 |
| **Eligibility:** | A background in biology is required (i.e. completion of NYS Living Environment curriculum) and chemistry is suggested. Students must complete ninth grade by the start of the program. |
| **Lab Hours:** | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Monday - Thursday | 9:00am - 3:00pm | | Friday | 9:00am - 2:00pm | |
| **Instructors:** | Rob Bolen and Kevin Richards |

Program Format: Students will work in cooperative groups to explore various techniques plausible for
high school level research. Students will be introduced to various model systems,
such as E. coli, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster. Students will learn specific techniques that can be utilized with these organisms,
such as bacterial transformations, gel electrophoresis, plasmid engineering, PCR analysis,
DNA/RNA extraction, and RT-PCR analysis.
