# NYC Residential Summer

For a truly immersive college experience, students who are 15 years of age or older are eligible to reside on our Morningside Campus: a serene academic community where they will always be mere steps away from classrooms, libraries, amenities—and New York City.

*Please Note: Students who are 15 years of age must turn 16 by December 31 of the year they attend the NYC Residential Summer program.*

## Academics

Students will choose from over 70 courses in a dozen subject areas, spending about four hours in class every weekday with a two-hour midday break. Classes are taught by expert instructors who will challenge students to think independently, critically, and creatively, with both open-mindedness and precision.

> It's really been three weeks of absolute bliss, rigorous academic challenges, and meeting different like-minded people from all across the world, all the while living in the bustling city of New York on one of the most beautiful campuses in the world.”

### Credentials

Upon successful completion, students will earn a Columbia University Certification of Participation and an evaluation letter reflecting their performance in the program to further set them apart in the college application process.

## The Residential Program

Residential students enjoy the convenience of being steps away from class and campus resources alike, and can easily attend a wide variety of daily activities and events—like lectures by our prestigious faculty, college prep workshops, community-building activities, and health & wellness programs.  

More than half of students choose to live on Morningside Campus, where they can enjoy the excitement of New York City just as readily as any of the resources on our 36-acre campus.

### Residential Life

Residential students live in Columbia's residence halls, just steps away from classrooms, the dining hall, libraries, the gym, and Health Services. Live-in Resident Advisors supervise students living on campus and are devoted to looking after their safety and well-being.

### Living on Campus

When your backyard is New York City, you get to have once-in-a-lifetime experiences a little more often. No matter what interests you, New York is sure to have it.

## Daily Schedule

Classes meet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, separated by a 2-hr midday break. All residential students are welcome to join the various activities, outings, and workshops available throughout the day, as well as weekly special events Friday and Saturday.   
  
Because students self-register in order to choose the course that works best for their schedule, details will vary for each student. [Visit the course pages](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/programs/explore-courses?interests=All&term=All&format=All&status=All&related_program=11871) for more information.
