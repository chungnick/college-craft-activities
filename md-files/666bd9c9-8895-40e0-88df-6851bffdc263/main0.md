As part of a cohort, you will participate in a series of workshops for personal and professional development, mentoring, and networking opportunities.

Our rotational internship model provides you the opportunity to work in 2-3 different departments throughout your summer experience. This helps you gain a broader perspective of the many people, skills and roles that come together in the care of patients in our community and the opportunity to explore different environments first-hand.
