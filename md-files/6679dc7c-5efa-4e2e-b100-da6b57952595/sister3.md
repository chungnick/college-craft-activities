# Program Description

### **Research Experience for High School Students**

This is an intensive seven week program for gifted high school students which combines
formal instruction with independent research and allows students to design original
research projects with guidance from Garcia Center faculty, students, and staff. Students
can continue during the academic year in the Mentor Program, which allows them to
plan a research schedule with a faculty mentor throughout the year. Pre-arranged transportation
and class schedules are coordinated with local school boards to enable students from
a large geographical area to enroll in the program. Almost three hundred high school
students have participated in the mentor program since its inception.

The students have consistently won recognition for their research through national
competitions ([LISEF](http://www.lisef.org/), [NYCSEF](http://collegenow.cuny.edu/sciencefair/), [NYSSEF](http://nyssef.org/), [ISEF](http://www.societyforscience.org/ISEF/)), published in refereed journals, been awarded patents, inducted into the National
Young Inventor's Hall of Fame, and been accepted to universities or professional programs
of their choice.

### **Research Experience for Undergraduates**

The Garcia Program hosts a research program for college undergraduate and rising seniors.
The REU program is a seven week summer program where undergraduate students work in
teams with high school students,high school teachers, graduate students and post docs
on specific research projects of their interest. Many of the REU participants were
former high school students who returned for multiple summers. Some students prefer
to continue working on the same project, with the goal of eventual publication, while
others opt to sample different projects and gain experience in diverse fields.

### **Research Experience for High School Teachers**

The Garcia Center for Polymers, funded by the National Science Foundation for research
and education on Polymer Engineering has four openings in the Research Experience
for High School Teachers (RET) summer program. The summer program lasts 7 weeks, starting
the last week of June and pays a stipend. Candidates can work independently or join
existing research groups doing research on polymer blends, composite materials, polymer/inorganic
surfaces and interfaces, protein and DNA surface interactions, polymer recycling,
polymer materials engineering, theoretical modeling, x-ray and neutron scattering
at Brookhaven National Laboratory, electron, x-ray and scanning force microscopy,
Infrared spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Candidates will publish
in refereed research journals and attend professional conferences.
