Ohio State is in the process of revising websites and program materials to accurately reflect compliance with the law. While this work occurs, language referencing protected class status or other activities prohibited by Ohio Senate Bill 1 may still appear in some places. However, all programs and activities are being administered in compliance with federal and state law.

# Arts and Sciences Summer Exploration Program

The Arts and Sciences Summer Exploration Program offers middle and high school students one-week intensive academic enrichment courses intended to introduce them to new areas of study or allow them to engage in content they may already have an interest in. In-person classes meet from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and are taught by Ohio State faculty, staff, and graduate students. Teaching is active, hands-on and encourages participants to engage with the instructional team and their fellow participants. These courses are not for grade or credit and are designed for self-motivated learners.

Eligibility is based on a participant’s grade level for the 2025-2026 school year. Students entering 7th - 9th grades in the fall of 2025 are eligible for middle school courses. Students entering 10th - 12th grade in the fall of 2025 are eligible for high school courses.

If you have questions about this program, please contact [ExploreASC@osu.edu](mailto:ExploreASC@osu.edu) or call Andre Brown at 614-247-1618.

We are no longer accepting applications for the summer 2025 program. The application deadline was May 1st, 2025.

## 2025 Course Offerings for Middle School Students

The Science of Seeing - June 2-6 - FULL

### The Science of Seeing

**Dates**: June 2-6

**Eligibility**: Middle School (rising 7th - 9th graders)

**Description**: Dive into the fascinating world of vision, focusing on how we perceive and interpret the world through our eyes. Throughout this course, participants will uncover the intricacies of eye anatomy, explore how visual information is processed by the brain, and discover various vision disorders and their impacts on perception. Using a combination of lectures, hands-on experiments, and interactive activities, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of eye physiology and the neurological aspects of seeing. They will see firsthand the anatomy of the eye using animal tissues prepared for participant dissection and participate in activities that measure visual accuracy and illustrate common visual phenomena such as blind spots, color blindness, and optical illusions.

By exploring vision disorders and simulating different visual impairments, participants will develop empathy and a deeper appreciation for the challenges faced by those with sensory disabilities. participants will foster critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills by investigating how our brains interpret conflicting information from vision and other senses. This course aims to encourage participants to reflect on the essential role vision plays in our lives and how it shapes our interaction with the world. During this course, participants will observe and investigate a cow eye that has been prepared for dissection.

**Prerequisites:**Previous experience with the subject matter is not required for this course.

Eco-Printmaking: Sustainable Art for People and the Planet - June 9-13

### Eco-Printmaking: Sustainable Art for People and the Planet

**Dates**: June 9-13

**Eligibility**: Middle School (rising 7th - 9th graders)

**Description**: Calling all artists and creatives!

Ready to level up your art but want to keep it eco-friendly and non-toxic? Discover the process of eco-printmaking with a hands-on workshop. You will learn special techniques such as screen printing, relief printing, monoprinting, and risography. Work in a real Ohio State printmaking studio, watch live art demos and hear from guest artists who will inspire your creativity. During this course participants will use sharp tools and operate printmaking equipment. Participants will be supervised and provided with personal safety training for every technique, but there is an inherent risk of injury.

**Prerequisites:**Previous studio art experience is not required. A general interest in creative thinking and artmaking is beneficial.

**Course Specific Requirements:**

* Close-toe shoes are recommended
* Clothing may get art materials on them. Participants should dress accordingly

## 2025 Course Offerings for High School Students

Developing Adaptable STEM Skills - June 9-13

**Dates:** June 9-13

**Eligibility**: High School (rising 10th - 12th graders)

**Description:** STEM skills are needed regardless of whether participants pursue STEM careers or majors. These next-generation skills are rapidly evolving in the context of artificial intelligence, so we must develop adaptable skills for a changing workforce climate. Many industries require participants to ‘think like a scientist'. Who identifies as a scientist and how science is conducted is evolving. The skills commonly attributed to scientists are being applied across many industries, and focusing on STEM skills as something only for scientists limits for whom and how these skills are applied.

This course aims to introduce participants to nationally recognized science practices and imbue participants with transferable skills that will prepare them for a dynamic workforce. Participants will engage in the scientific process by asking questions, designing small-scale experiments, collecting and analyzing data, constructing explanations, and engaging in argumentation using evidence. This will culminate in a final project presentation in which participants will employ science communication skills. This authentic research experience will help participants develop critical thinking skills to prepare for their coursework, careers, and citizenship beyond the classroom. Participants can select project topics ranging from health, biological, and physical sciences.

**Prerequisites:** Previous experience with the subject matter is not required for this course.

**Specific Course Requirements:**

* Personal laptop and charger
  + Contact [ExploreASC@osu.edu](mailto:ExploreASC@osu.edu) if lack of access to a personal computer would limit participation

Leadership: What It Is and How to Get It - June 9-13

**Dates:** June 9-13

**Eligibility**: High School (rising 10th - 12th graders)

**Description:** Ready. Set. Lead!

Think leaders are just CEOs, presidents, or team captains? No matter your experience, age, or personality, we all have the power to lead.

This summer, join us for an unforgettable journey into leadership. You learn about leadership styles and theories, learn what makes history’s greatest leaders stand out, and meet inspiring professionals and leaders from different industries. Register today to learn the secrets of impactful leadership. Let’s go!

**Prerequisites:** Previous experience with the subject matter is not required for this course.

Sensational Science: Exploring Human Perception - June 23-27

**Dates:** June 23-27

**Eligibility**: High School (rising 10th - 12th graders)

**Description:** Discover the wonders and mysteries of how we perceive the world around us. Participants will explore not only the traditional five senses—sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch—but also examine proprioception, nociception, balance, and the complex neural networks that integrate sensory information. Through a dynamic blend of lectures, hands-on experiments, interactive activities, and group discussions, participants will learn the science behind how we perceive our environment and ourselves as well as enhance critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills by investigating how our brains interpret conflicting sensory information.

Each section will begin with an introduction to the anatomy and physiology of relevant organs and areas of the brain, which includes dissection of animal tissues prepared for participant use. This course also goes beyond the basics to uncover the fascinating spectrum of sensory and perception disorders. From the challenges of navigating the world with color blindness or anosmia to the extraordinary experiences of synesthesia, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse the human experience of the world can be.

During this course, participants will observe and investigate a cow eye that has been prepared for dissection.

**Prerequisites:** Previous experience with the subject matter is not required for this course.
