## Application Announcement

#### 2026 Application Window Opens December 1st!

#### A Special Summer Program for High School Students

In 2026, the School of Engineering at Santa Clara University will host its 37th Annual Summer Engineering Seminar (SES) program. This award winning program has been named as an **Inspiring Program in STEM** from the [*INSIGHT Into Academia*](https://www.insightintodiversity.com/) magazine for the last four consecutive years ([2022](https://www.scu.edu/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/august-2022/scu-summer-engineering-seminar-receives-insight-into-diversity-award.html), [2023 (page 64)](https://www.insightintodiversity.com/wp-content/media/digitalissues/september2023/index.html), [2024,](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/news--events/press-releases/scu-summer-engineering-seminar-receives-insight-into-diversity-award-for-third-consecutive-year.html) and in [2025](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/news--events/press-releases/scu-summer-engineering-seminar-receives-insight-into-diversity-award-for-fourth-consecutive-year.html)). Which is now the last FREE residential pre-college engineering program in the nation.   

This outstanding, FREE, five-day immersive summer experience is for current high school sophomores and juniors, who are interested in exploring the field of engineering. Offering specially designed introductory workshops taught by our engineering faculty and undergraduate students. Presented as a mix of lecture and interactive work, spanning several fields of engineering. Getting a taste of academic expectations and projects possible in college. Participants will also get a taste of university life. Living in the dorms during the program, and interacting with our faculty, undergraduates, and other members of the SCU community throughout their stay. 

In 2026, the SES program was offered three times over the course of the summer. With the first two session being our "introduction program" for new participants. Priority going to Sophomores, with limited space available to Juniors. With a focus on introducing the field of engineering and high school to college transition. While our third session being our advanced "Year-Two program". Open only to returning SES participants who participated in the summer of 2025. With a focus on diving deeper into engineering around humanitarian engineering, and the roles of various engineering majors around humanitarian efforts. Thus, allowing us to offer SES as a two-year program for some participants from the introductory program who want to come back during the summer of 2027 to dive deeper into the majors they are interested in. 

You can apply to attend one of the following two introductory session options:

SES Introduction (Year-One):

* Session One: July 12-16
* Session Two: July 19-23

SES Advanced (Year-Two) Returning Participants: **Past participants will receive a separate application invitation (Not open to general applicant pool)**

* Session Three: July 26- 30

Sponsors Confirmed for 2026: [SCU Inclusive Excellence Division](https://www.scu.edu/inclusive-excellence-division/), [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/innovation-labs), and [Inspector Planet](https://inspectorplanet.com/).

[The Program](#accordion-panel-85627)

The SES program is designed to **motivate** young people to pursue science and engineering majors in college so they can ultimately participate in the scientific and technical workforce. It provides participants with a chance to **explore** the many possibilities of engineering as a career. Participants attend special workshops, complete their own engineering projects, and experience outside-of-class aspects of Santa Clara University through afternoon and evening recreational activities. 

During the week participants attend introductory level workshops spanning several disciplines of engineering that are facilitated by our engineering faculty. Topics will include: Bioengineering; Civil, Sustainable and Environmental Engineering; Computer Science and Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering; and Mechanical Engineering. Participants attend all core workshops for a broad exposure to the various disciplines and careers within the field of engineering. Workshops will be held by the School of Engineering, the focal point for engineering education at Santa Clara University.

  (Santa Clara, Calif., June 16, 2025)— Santa Clara University and the Summer Engineering Seminar (SES) program received the 2025 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from Insight Into Academia magazine, the largest and oldest academic excellence and belonging publication in higher education.

* [Inspiring Access: SES Wins STEM Award for Fourth Year](/engineering/stories/inspiring-access-ses-wins-stem-award-for-fourth-year.html)

  Santa Clara University's Summer Engineering Seminar (SES) has once again received national recognition, as it has been selected for the 2025 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award by Insight Into Academia magazine for the fourth consecutive year. SCU will be featured in the magazine’s June edition alongside 51 other institutions working to expand access and excellence in science, technology, engineering, and math. The award highlights SES’s ongoing efforts to support underrepresented students. From historic underrepresented communities in STEM. From a mix of low-income, first-generation women and non-binary individuals, and various ethnic backgrounds. For SES alum Caitlyn Gonzalez, the honor comes as no surprise.
