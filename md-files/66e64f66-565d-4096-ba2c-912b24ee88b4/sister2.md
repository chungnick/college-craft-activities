4. Outreach

Our students and faculty are actively involved with outreach to the community.

Our outreach efforts touch more than 10,000 K-12 youth annually. The School of Engineering engages with school children and industry partners alike, sharing our enthusiasm, knowledge, and research capabilities with a broad range of constituents.

We also invite high school students to apply for one of our intensive experiences. The [Summer Engineering Seminar (SES)](/engineering/beyond-the-classroom/outreach/summer-engineering-seminar-ses/) affords the opportunity to come and live on campus for a week, eat in the dining hall, attend workshops, recreational activities, and experience university life as a Bronco engineer. For local high school students, [Spring Engineering Education Days (SEEDs)](/engineering/beyond-the-classroom/outreach/spring-engineering-education-days-seeds/) offers the chance to come to campus on three Sundays in the Spring to attend workshops providing an introduction to various engineering disciplines.
