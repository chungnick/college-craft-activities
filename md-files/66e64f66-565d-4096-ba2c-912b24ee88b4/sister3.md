## SCU Summer Engineering Seminar Receives INSIGHT Into Diversity Award for Third Consecutive Year

(Santa Clara, Calif., October 4, 2024)— Santa Clara University and the Summer Engineering Seminar (SES) program, for the third consecutive year received the 2024 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the largest and oldest diversity and inclusion publication in higher education.

**(Santa Clara, Calif., October 4, 2024)**— Santa Clara University and the Summer Engineering Seminar (SES) program, for the third consecutive year received the 2024 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the largest and oldest diversity and inclusion publication in higher education. The Inspiring Programs in STEM Award honors colleges and universities that encourage and assist students from underrepresented groups to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Santa Clara University will be featured, along with 82 other recipients, in the September 2024 issue of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine.

Inspiring Programs in STEM Award winners were selected by INSIGHT Into Diversity based on efforts to inspire and encourage a new generation of young people to consider careers in STEM through mentoring, teaching, research, and successful programs and initiatives.

“SES is committed to exposing underrepresented youth interested in STEM to the idea that not only is college possible, but they also deserve a spot. With the commitment from the School of Engineering, SES has been able to stick around for 35 years now, having introduced a second-year program in 2023. It is with sponsor support from the [SCU Ignatian Center: McCormick Fund,](https://www.scu.edu/ic/) [Verizon,](https://www.verizon.com/) [Southwest,](https://www.southwest.com/) [Honda,](https://www.honda.com/) [NVIDIA,](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) [Samsung Semiconductor,](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/) [One Workplace,](https://www.oneworkplace.com/) and [Inspector Planet](https://inspectorplanet.com/) that we can grow the program’s reach and relevance to youth,” said Ricardo Padilla, Jr., Programs Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in STEM.

INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine selected Santa Clara University and the Summer Engineering Seminar program because of their efforts to provide underrepresented high school students access to engineering courses and programs through a five-day on-campus immersion summer experience. The program offers participants an opportunity to delve into the diverse prospects of a career in engineering. Participants engage in special workshops, complete their own engineering projects, and immerse themselves in outside-of-class aspects of Santa Clara University through afternoon and evening recreational activities.

“We know that many STEM programs are not always recognized for their success, dedication, and mentorship for underrepresented students,” says Lenore Pearlstein, owner and publisher of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. “We want to honor the schools and organizations that have created programs that inspire and encourage young people who may currently be in or are interested in a future career in STEM. We are proud to honor these programs as role models to other institutions of higher education and beyond.”

A call for nominations for this award was announced in April 2024.
