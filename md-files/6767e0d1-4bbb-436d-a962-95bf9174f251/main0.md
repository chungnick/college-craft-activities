# Young Innovators: Climate & Energy

Course Status: Open

Pre-college applications are now open. Join us this coming summer!

## Course Description

To meet the global energy challenge, the next generation of climate and energy scientists must address the need for reliable, affordable energy to foster economic growth while averting climate change and damages to the environment. This one-week residential program provides talented and ambitious students a window into future careers in the realm of climate and energy policy. Through rigorous discussion-based classes, readings, lectures, and collaborative hands-on projects, students will learn about pressing issues in climate and energy from leading faculty in the [Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/about/), the [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/), and the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org/).

Students will also be exposed to the kinds of opportunities available in a large urban center for academic work and professional development (as well as just for fun!) through activities that showcase the city of Chicago, including a tour and discussion panel with industry professionals at Invenergy's Chicago headquarters. Invenergy team members will speak to their experience working in different parts of the industry and provide an inspiring example to students of what they can do with STEM degrees. Advancements in climate policy and sustainability efforts will require the collective efforts of a diverse community. Students of all backgrounds who value diversity of thought and experience are encouraged to apply.

This program is offered in partnership with Invenergy, an industry leader in renewable and clean energy generation, and the Polsky Foundation. Students will be hosted on-campus, and program participants must reside in campus housing for the duration of the program.
