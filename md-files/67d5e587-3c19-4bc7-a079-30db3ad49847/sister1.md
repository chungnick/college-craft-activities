# Frequently Asked Questions

* [General Questions](#2)
* [Financial Aid and Scholarship Questions](#3)
* [Admitted Student Questions](#4)

#### Application Questions

**Q: Is my application complete?**  
Your freshman application is complete when we have received the application with essay,
SAT/ACT scores, guidance counselor report, teacher recommendation, your high school
transcript and your FAFSA (required by November 1 for scholarship consideration, **for Fall 2025 freshmen applicants, the FAFSA will open in December and should be completed
by January 1 or as soon as possible**). Your transfer application is complete when we have received your application and
transcripts from all colleges you have attended. Transfer applicants with less than
24 credits must also submit high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores.

Starting in mid-late November, freshman and transfer applicants for the fall semester
are able to check the status of their applications online to determine what materials
we have received. After we receive the application form, you will receive an e-mail
which provides you a username and password so you can login and check the status of
your application.

**Q: Do you consider demonstrated interest in the admission process?**  
Yes, while your academic performance is of primary importance, **demonstrated interest** is an important part of the application review process. This means that visiting
campus, attending an open house and reading our emails are all important. We value
students who have done their homework, taken the time to get to know Seton Hall and
understand what we offer. When we review applications, we are looking for students
who are the right fit for Seton Hall, and part of that is making sure that applicants
have gotten to know us and are serious about becoming a member of our community.

**Q: Do you accept the Common Application?**  
Yes, Seton Hall accepts the Common Application for freshman applicants. Transfer applicants
must apply through the Seton Hall application.

**Q: When will I receive an admission decision?**  
It usually takes 4 to 6 weeks for an admissions decision to be made once your application
is complete. If you applied Early Action I and submitted all of your application materials
before November 15, you will receive a decision by December 30. All early action applications
are given priority in the application review process.

**Q: Are interviews required?**  
Interviews are not required but you are welcome to arrange one if you are interested.
If you wish to schedule an interview, call the Office of Admissions at 973-313-6146
or e-mail [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2d6cac7cac3cecee2d1cad78cc7c6d7).

**Q: How many letters of recommendations do I need?**  
Seton Hall requires two letters of recommendation — one from a guidance counselor
and one from a teacher. If you would like to submit additional recommendations you
are welcome to do so; but it will not affect your application standing. Transfer students
with more than 24 credits do not need to submit letters of recommendation.

**Q: How much is the application fee?**  
Seton Hall's undergraduate application fee is $65 for both Seton Hall's application
and the Common Application.

**Q: Can my application fee be waived?**  
If your guidance counselor determines that you have an economic hardship, he/she can
submit a College Board fee waiver request which will be accepted. In addition you
can consult the Office of Admissions at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f6b777a777e73735f6c776a317a7b6a) or 973-313-6146 to see if we can provide you with a waiver.

**Q: Can my application fee be refunded?**  
Unfortunately, we are unable to refund application fees once they have been submitted.

**Q: Is early action binding?**  
Early action is not binding. Early Action means that you are indicating to the University
that we are among your top choices. It also means that your application will be among
the first to be reviewed for admission and scholarship. Early Action I applicants
who have submitted all required application materials by **November 15** will receive a decision by **December 30**.

**Q: What standardized tests does SHU accept?**  
Seton Hall accepts both the SAT and the ACT. We will take the highest of the two tests
and have no preference in regards to which you submit. We will super-score the results
of each exam.

Through the fall 2026 application period, Seton Hall will also be providing students
the option of applying for test optional admission. To learn more, please [click here](/undergraduate-admissions/test-optional-admission.html).

**Q: How do I get my test scores to SHU?**  
Contact the [College Board for SAT](http://www.collegeboard.org/) scores or [ACT](http://www.actstudent.org/) and have them send your scores to our office. Seton Hall cannot accept copies of
the scores you receive. Seton Hall will accept your scores if they are located on
your official high school transcript. Seton Hall's codes are 2811 for SAT and 2606
for ACT.

**Q: I graduated a few years ago; do I still need to submit my SAT?**  
Students that have graduated high school at least five or more years ago are not required
to submit their SAT or ACT scores. Also any student that has attained 24 or more credits
from a college or university will not be required to submit standardized test scores.

**Q: What do I need to do if I've been home schooled?**  
Home schooled students are welcome at Seton Hall. We will need you to submit your
SAT/ACT scores, recommendation forms and essays as well as a copy of your transcript
or home school record. If a home school record/transcript is not available a GED may
be submitted instead.

**Q: When am I considered a transfer student?**  
A transfer student is any applicant who has attempted at least 6 college credits after
high school graduation.

**Q: How do I apply for the University Honors Program?**  
The University Honors Program requires a separate application and admission to the
program is offered to those students who show exemplary grades, test scores and leadership
in high school. Generally a minimum of a 3.5 GPA and a 27 on the ACT or a 660 ERW
on the SAT are required for admission. Learn more or apply to the University Honors
Program by visiting the [Honors Program website](/honors-program/index.html).

tests (AP or IB).

transfer credits later than the end of the first semester of enrollment at Seton Hall
University may be ineligible to have these credits evaluated and applied towards their
degree at Seton Hall.

Yes, just submit AP and IB scores and we will grant you college-level credit for AP
exam scores of 4 or above and higher-level IB scores of grade 6 or higher. Incoming

[Complete this form](http://admissions.shu.edu/request-information.html) or send an e-mail to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#17637f727f767b7b57647f6239727362) with your first name, last name, address, phone number, e-mail address, date of birth,

[Click here to find your admissions counselor.](https://www.shu.edu/undergraduate-admissions/find-a-counselor.html)

**Q: Is housing guaranteed?**  
Housing is not guaranteed, however Seton Hall will set aside 1,150 beds for new students.
We encourage all incoming students to pay the housing deposit of $375 by the **May 1** deadline, if not sooner. You must also submit a tuition deposit to have your housing
deposit considered complete. Upper class students must reapply for housing each year
and can strengthen their spot on the housing list by earning points. Points are earned
for strong academics, community service, involvement in campus activities and not
getting into trouble. However, many upper class students choose not to live on campus
but choose to rent houses or apartments with classmates in the local area.

Freshmen are not required to live on campus and 80 percent of freshmen live on campus.
Students living on campus are required to have a meal plan.

**Q: Is your campus a residential campus?**  
Seton Hall is a residential campus, we have over 2,300 students in residence on campus
and about half of these students come from out-of-state. In addition to this number,
many upper class students rent apartments or houses in the area and within walking
distance to campus adding to the residential feeling of campus since these students
just live a few blocks away and also spend their weekends enjoying activities on campus.

**Q: What is your religious affiliation; what order is the University?**  
Seton Hall is a diocesan university under the Archdiocese of Newark therefore we are
not affiliated with any particular order (i.e. Jesuit, etc.). Seton Hall is the oldest
diocesan university in the country.

**Q: Do I have to be Catholic to attend the University or will I feel out of place if
I'm not Catholic?**  
No, Seton Hall University welcomes students of all faiths and we have a very diverse
community with students representing many religions. The University fosters universal
values such as service, integrity and compassion and creates an environment that encourages
dialogue, acceptance and respect. About 70% of Seton Hall students identify as Catholic
and for those students, there are many ways to deepen their faith including masses
several times a day.

**Q: What can you tell me about fire safety on campus?**  
The University has installed extensive sprinkler systems in all the residence halls.
Our sprinkler systems go beyond the requirements of state code. We incorporated intensive
fire safety training as part of the orientation to residence halls living. Seton Hall
has the highest technology available for fire safety and once a fire alarm is pulled
South Orange fire department is immediately notified.

**Q: What should I do if I am placed on the waitlist?**  
The first thing you should do if you are placed on the waitlist is to submit the [Waitlist Response form](https://app.shu.edu/register/waitlist) if you are still interested in being considered for admission. You should try to
strengthen your application by scheduling an interview. We also suggest you retake
the SAT/ACT as well as focus on your studies to improve your GPA and submit additional
recommendation letters if possible.

**Q: I'm interested in joining one of your sports teams, what should I do?**  
You should complete the online athlete questionnaire found at [www.shupirates.com](http://www.shupirates.com). In addition, you can write a letter and send a video to our coach or have your high
school coach write to our coach. Use the Seton Hall address and place the coach’s
title on the top.

#### Financial Aid and Scholarship Questions

**Q: Do you offer scholarships?**  
Seton Hall is very generous with scholarships and financial aid, we give over $170
million dollars annually to support our students and 98 percent of our students receive
some form of financial aid and 98 percent of students receive a grant or scholarship
directly from Seton Hall. Incoming students are automatically considered for a scholarship
upon admission. In addition there are many special scholarships for which you can
apply. These scholarships have a **January 15** deadline, learn more at [www.shu.edu/scholarships](/scholarships/index.html).

**Q: What is the scholarship deadline?**  
All applicants are automatically considered for University scholarships. However there
are many special scholarships for which students can apply. All of these awards have
a **January 15** deadline. For a complete list of scholarships, visit [www.shu.edu/scholarships](/scholarships/index.html).

**Q: What are the terms and conditions for the University Scholarship, Summer Scholarship
and Transfer Scholarship?**

**University Scholarship terms:** Beginning with the first semester of enrollment at Seton Hall, this award will be
renewable for the following three consecutive undergraduate years. By the end of their
freshman year, recipients of this award must earn a 2.0 cumulative grade point average.
By the end of their sophomore and junior years, recipients of this award must maintain
a 2.5 cumulative grade point average. Recipients must also successfully complete at
least 24 credits per academic year and remain a full-time student. This award may
be combined with other awards but can only be applied to the undergraduate flat tuition
rate charges at Seton Hall and must be divided equally between the fall and spring
semesters. It cannot be used to cover any fees or room & board charges. If you do
not utilize this award in a given fall or spring semester, you will forfeit these
funds and they cannot be applied to any other term or courses. This award cannot be
used for enrollment in the summer, non-Seton Hall enrollment, study abroad, graduate
level course work even if it is part of a joint degree program or course work taken
at another institution, even if it is part of a joint degree program. The University
Scholarship may be fully or partially renamed at a later date to recognize the donor
supporting these funds.

**Summer Scholarship terms:** This award will be available for the summer after your freshman, sophomore, and junior
years only, provided you take a minimum of 6 credits in the summer term. You are not
required to enroll every summer to maintain award eligibility. This award cannot be
applied to study abroad, off-campus enrollment, non-Seton Hall enrollment or graduate
level study. This award cannot be used in the fall or spring semester and cannot be
prorated if you take less than 6 credits in the summer. If you do not utilize this
award in a given summer, you will forfeit these funds and they cannot be applied to
any other term or courses. Maintaining eligibility for the University Scholarship
is also a condition of this award.

**Transfer Scholarship terms:** Beginning with the first semester of enrollment at Seton Hall, this award will be
renewable for the following five semesters. Recipients of this award must maintain
a 2.5 cumulative grade point average, successfully complete at least 24 credits per
academic year and remain a full-time student. This award may be combined with other
awards but can only be applied to the undergraduate flat tuition rate charges at Seton
Hall and must be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters. It cannot
be used to cover any fees or room and board charges. If you do not utilize this award
in a given fall or spring semester, you will forfeit these funds and they cannot be
applied to any other term or courses. This award cannot be used for enrollment in
the summer, non-Seton Hall enrollment, study abroad, graduate level course work even
if it is part of a joint degree program or course work taken at another institution,
even if it is part of a joint degree program. The Transfer Scholarship may be fully
or partially renamed at a later date to recognize the donor supporting these funds.

**Q: How do I apply for Financial Aid at Seton Hall University?**  
In order to apply for financial aid, you need to complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online](https://studentaid.gov). You can apply as early as **October 1** and we recommend you do so no later than **November 1** (Please note: for Fall 2025 freshmen applicants, the FAFSA will open in December and
should be completed by January 1 or as soon as possible). Filing the FAFSA will entitle
you to consideration for need-based grants, as well as work-study and student loans.
You do not need to file the FAFSA for scholarship consideration.

**Q. Why isn’t my Summer Scholarship on my financial aid package?**  
The financial aid package you received only provides an indication of financial aid
awards and tuition and fees for the fall and spring semesters. It does not list any
summer costs or summer aid. If the student registers for 6 or more credits over the
summer (as specified in the scholarship letter) he/she will become eligible for this
scholarship. This scholarship will be posted to the student’s account at the start
of summer courses. If the student registers for 6 credits over the summer and has
the summer scholarship applied to his/her account, but then withdraws from one of
the courses, the scholarship will be removed as the 6-credit requirement will no longer
be fulfilled.

**Q. How do I accept my awards, and what if I don’t want to accept all the financial
aid offered to me?**  
You will need to log on to PirateNet to accept your awards. You can only gain access
to PirateNet starting in March after you submit your tuition deposit. You may choose
to accept all the financial aid offered or only certain individual financial aid components,
such as loans, work or grants. If one component is declined, no additional aid will
be offered to make up for that declined aid.

**Q. Do I automatically receive the Direct Federal Loans listed on my financial aid
award letter?**  
While you are automatically entitled to this award, to actually obtain these loans,
you must take additional steps. First, you must accept the loan on PirateNet (where
you can also reduce the loan amount if needed). In addition, you will be redirected
to www.studentloans.gov where you will need to complete a master promissory note and
an entrance interview. Once you complete this process your loan will be formalized.

**Q. I accepted my loan and now I need to change the amount. How do I do this?**  
You will need to complete a Loan Adjustment Form, which is available on the Documents
and Forms tab of the Seton Hall Financial Aid website.

**Q. My parent applied for a PLUS loan and has been denied. What should we do now?**  
If your parent is denied a PLUS loan, you will automatically qualify for an additional
$4,000 of an unsubsidized Direct Loan. You will need to complete a Loan Adjustment
Form requesting the additional $4,000. This form is available on the Documents and
Forms tab of the Seton Hall Financial Aid website. If additional loan funds are needed
after this has been awarded, parents should explore other loan options at www.elmselect.com.
If the parent’s credit check makes it difficult to qualify for any loans, then it
is suggested that you explore having a co-signer.

**Q: Do you require the CSS Profile?**  
No, we do not require the profile and there is no need for you to complete one. We
only use the FAFSA.

**Q: My parents are divorced, what parental information do I have to list on my FAFSA?**  
When filing the FAFSA the student should use the information from the parent he/she
lives with the majority of the time. If this parent is remarried then the information
for the parent and the step parent with whom the student lives must be used to complete
the FAFSA even if the step parent does not plan to contribute to the education.

**Q. What should I do if the information on my FAFSA no longer represents my current
financial circumstances?**  
If there has been a change in your financial information or circumstances since you
filed your FAFSA, you may be entitled to a special circumstances/professional judgment
review. This is only possible in circumstances such as a loss of employment, death
of a parent, extensive medical bills, etc. We cannot perform a special circumstances
evaluation based on the fact that you want more aid and do not agree with results
of your FAFSA and the SAI (student aid index) provided by the federal government.

If indeed there has been a significant change in your financial circumstances and
it was not represented in the data you provided on your FAFSA, then you will need
to submit a Special Circumstances Application which can be found on the Documents
and Forms tab of the Seton Hall Financial Aid website. When completing the form you
must indicate the reason for your special circumstance and provide the required documentation
indicated on the form; required documentation will vary based on the reason for your
request. Once we receive your form, you will be notified by the Office of Financial
Aid via e-mail that your request was received. Review of special circumstances requests
begins in February, and it generally takes 4-6 weeks to process these requests if
all required information is on file. Once a review is completed, you will receive
notification via e-mail.

The special circumstances review allows the financial aid office to reassess your
information while taking these new circumstances into consideration. The purpose of
this is to recalculate your SAI based on this new information. Your SAI is the driver
of need-based aid; therefore, a special circumstances review will only impact need-based
aid and will have no bearing on any scholarships or merit-based aid. If you apply
for a special circumstances review, this does not necessarily mean you will become
eligible for any additional financial aid funding.

There are two primary reasons a special circumstances review may not result in any
additional funding. First, if your SAI is already at 0, it cannot be adjusted any
lower, so a special circumstances review will not result in any changes to your aid
eligibility as we cannot reduce an SAI any lower than 0. Because your SAI is at 0,
you would have already qualified for the maximum amount of need-based aid available
to you. Therefore, even if submitted, special circumstances reviews will not be performed
for students who already have an SAI at 0.

The second reason a special circumstances review may not result in any additional
aid is that the adjustment to your EFC did not qualify you for any need-based aid.
For example, let’s say you filed the FAFSA based on tax return data that indicated
that both of your parents were employed and as a result your current EFC is $40,000.
However, one of your parents lost their job since the filing of those taxes. In this
instance, we can perform a special circumstances review to reassess your EFC. Let’s
say once this recalculation is performed your new EFC is reduced to $10,000. Even
though this EFC is much lower than your previous EFC, this still may not be sufficient
enough to qualify you for any need-based aid. As a point of reference, federal need-based
aid generally only applies to students with an EFC of about $5,000 and the amount
of available aid varies from about $600 a year to about $6000 a year.

**Q. Can my scholarship or grants from Seton Hall be extended beyond four years?**  
No, scholarships and grants from Seton Hall are only available for four years, even
if you need to take longer to complete your program. This means if the award was not
received in a given semester or prorated due to an exception, these funds are no longer
available to the student and will not be reallocated to a future term. Exceptions
will be made for students that have withdrawn for medical reasons. This would have
to be confirmed by the Dean of Students office.

**Q: Can I use my scholarship for my entire joint degree program?**  
No, University Scholarships are only good for four years and can only cover the Seton
Hall flat tuition rate for full-time undergraduate study at Seton Hall. It cannot
cover any graduate-level coursework study at Seton Hall as part of a joint-degree
program or any coursework taken at a partner institution. Please note that undergraduate
coursework has course numbers beginning with the number 4 or less. Any course number
starting with a 5 is considered graduate level. If you are taking at least 12 credits
of undergraduate coursework each semester you are considered full time. If in your
senior year you are taking a combination of undergraduate and graduate courses or
courses offered at Seton Hall and a partner institution as part of a joint-degree
program and you drop below 12 Seton Hall undergraduate credits, your University Scholarship
will be prorated to cover undergraduate courses at Seton Hall in your senior year
and you will be charged separately for graduate-level courses toward which no scholarship
funds can be applied. If you are taking coursework at a partner institution, you will
be billed directly by the partner institution for these courses and no scholarship
funds can be applied.

Please also note that need-based grants follow the same policies and cannot be used
to cover graduate-level coursework, or coursework at a partner institution as part
of a joint degree program.

**Q: Can need-based grants or University Scholarships from Seton Hall cover my room
and board or books?**  
No, need-based grants and University Scholarships from Seton Hall University can only
be applied to tuition. These funds cannot be used to cover fees, room and board, books
or any other charges. If you receive multiple forms of financial aid which can only
be applied to tuition and the combined total of these awards exceeds the tuition charges
your awards will be reduced. In this case Seton Hall scholarships and need-based grants
will be the first forms of aid to be reduced.

**Q: Are Seton Hall Need-based grants automatically renewed?**  
No, Seton Hall need-based grants are not automatically renewable. Just because you
received the award in a given year does not mean you are assured of renewal in a subsequent
year. All students must file the FAFSA each year to determine eligibility for renewal.
Based on the results of your FAFSA and available funds, you may see a reduction in
your Seton Hall need-based grant or lose eligibility completely. This is also the
case with all need-based grants from the federal and state governments.

**Q. How will I know if changes have been made to my financial aid awards?**  
If you have not deposited yet, any adjustments or changes to the award letter can
be viewed online using the Applicant Portal. If you have already paid your tuition
deposit and it is after March 1, the award letter will be available via the Profile
and Finances tab on PirateNet (PirateNet.shu.edu). It is preferable to use PirateNet
as this is the information portal you will use throughout your studies at Seton Hall.

**Q. Should I expect to receive any additional scholarships or grants from Seton Hall
after I enroll?**  
No, the large majority of financial aid and scholarships at Seton Hall are awarded
to students at the point of admission. You will not receive any increases to your
Seton Hall awards during your enrollment. There are very limited additional scholarships
and grants for which enrolled students can apply. These awards are very competitive
and usually provide only nominal additional assistance. Also, while tuition increases
annually (usually between 3 - 6 percent), scholarships and grants remain fixed and
do not increase. Please keep all this in mind when planning to finance your college
education.

**Q: Why has my Seton Hall Scholarship or Grant been reduced?**  
Many financial aid awards are designated to only cover tuition costs and cannot be
used to cover other items such as fees, room and board, books, etc. Examples of such
awards are need-based TAG grants from the state of NJ, Seton Hall need-based grants,
University Scholarships, tuition remission and some scholarships from outside organizations.
If you receive multiple forms of financial aid which can only be applied to tuition
and the combined total of these awards exceeds the tuition charges, your awards will
be reduced. In this case Seton Hall scholarships and need-based grants will be the
first forms of aid to be reduced.

**Q. Is my financial aid affected by my academic performance or enrollment status?**   
Yes, students are required to maintain minimum GPA requirements to keep all scholarship
aid from Seton Hall; these specific criteria were outlined in your scholarship notification
letter. All other forms of aid, including loans, work study and need-based grants
from Seton Hall as well as the federal and state government, require you to maintain
Satisfactory Academic Progress guidelines. Detailed information can be found on our
website by searching for our Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. In addition, many
awards require full-time continuous enrollment to maintain award eligibility. Undergraduate
students need to register for at least 12 credits each semester to remain a full-time
student. University Scholarships require that students earn at least 30 credits annually
to maintain eligibility.

**Q. What happens if I can’t keep my GPA or credit load and I lose my scholarship?**  
There are two reasons you might lose your scholarship: you did not meet the GPA requirements
(as outlined in your scholarship letter) and/or you did not earn the required number
of credits (this is 30 at the end of the year for most scholarships). In regard to
your GPA, you will have until the end of your spring semester at Seton Hall to achieve
the GPA outlined in your scholarship letter. If you don’t meet this GPA at the end
of the fall semester, you will be sent an e-mail alert warning to help keep you on
track. If at the end of the spring semester your GPA is below what is outlined in
your scholarship letter, your scholarship will automatically be removed from your
record by the programming in our computer system. At this time, you will also receive
an e-mail notification about the loss of your scholarship, and you will be informed
about our appeal process. Students need to write a short statement requesting an appeal;
these appeals are then reviewed by a committee. Appeals are granted for the majority
of students, especially at the end of freshman year. In fact, approximately 85% of
appeals for freshmen are approved and scholarships are reinstated. But students must
file an appeal as instructed in the e-mail they receive in order to be considered
for scholarship reinstatement. If you don’t meet the 30-credit requirements at the
end of the spring semester, your scholarship will automatically be removed from your
record by the programming in our computer system. However, if you take classes over
the summer and reach the 30-credit requirement before the fall semester begins, your
scholarship will be reinstated. This will be done manually by the financial aid office
during a review at the end of all summer classes. If for some reason it is not adjusted,
all you need to do is bring this to the attention of the financial aid office in Bayley
Hall and the scholarship will be reinstated.

**Q. If I enroll less than full time during any semester or do not maintain continuous
full-time enrollment, can I keep my scholarship or grant?**  
No, you must be enrolled full time to keep your awards, with 12 credits per semester
as the minimum number of credits to be considered full time. However, most scholarships
from the University require that you earn 30 credits per year to maintain eligibility.
This means ideally you should take 15 credits each semester. However, you may take
the minimum of 12 credits but must make sure you earn at least 30 credits by the end
of the academic year to retain your scholarship. This may require that you take summer
courses. If you are enrolled less than full time (12 credits) you cannot keep your
scholarships or need-based grants from Seton Hall; you will lose them and they cannot
be prorated or reinstated in a future semester, even if you resume full-time status
the following semester. Exceptions are made for students in their last semester if
they do not require a full-time course load to complete their degree. In this case,
however, you must consult with financial aid for an adjustment. On rare occasions,
exceptions are also made for students who do not maintain continuous enrollment or
remain enrolled full time; these include family, personal or medical emergencies which
result in the need for the student to withdraw from courses for a specific term or
period. In this case, you must consult with financial aid and you or another department
on campus (such as health or counseling services) must provide proof of medical, personal
or family emergency.

**Q. Why isn’t my work study grant deducted from my bill like all of my other aid?**  
Work study is not applied to your account like other forms of aid. Notification indicates
that you are eligible to apply for a job on campus under the federal work study program.
This is not a guarantee of employment; students must find a job and work the necessary
hours to earn up to the amount for which they are eligible. Earnings from work study
are paid to students bi-weekly in a pay check; these earnings are not deducted from
your bill. Please keep this in mind when planning your loans and bill payment. Work
study funds are often useful to cover items such as books and personal expenses.

**Q. If I was not awarded a federal work study grant, can I still work on campus?**  
Yes, all students, regardless of eligibility for a work-study award, are eligible
to apply for a job on campus. Students should visit jobs.shu.edu and then click on
"Student" for a listing of job opportunities.

**Q. How do I pay my bill?**  
Students are billed prior to the start of each semester. You will receive your fall
semester bill in early July and it will be due in early August. Bills are not mailed;
they are only available electronically via PirateNet. An e-mail notification will
be sent to your Seton Hall e-mail account only from [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#286a5d5a5b495a685b405d064d4c5d) to notify you when bills are available. To view and pay your bill, you will need
your PirateNet username and password. Once you have logged into PirateNet, locate
the Profile and Finances tab and click "View and Pay my Account" to reach the payment
portal. Through the payment portal, you can view your account details, review your
PDF eStatements, add an authorized user and make payments via electronic check or
credit card.

If you would like to allow someone, like your parents, to receive your billing notices
and/or pay your bill, you must add an "authorized user." An authorized user is any
individual granted access by the student to receive billing notifications. This individual
will also have their own access to make online payments and view eStatements. To grant
someone access, log into PirateNet and click the Profile and Finances tab. Click "View
and Pay my Account" to reach the payment portal, then click "Authorized Users." We
will never send your bill to anyone that you have not authorized, and you can edit
this information at any time.

Please also be advised that your financial aid will not be disbursed to your account
until after classes have begun and faculty have verified your attendance.

For more information on billing and payment, visit [www.shu.edu/offices/bursar](/bursar/index.html) or e-mail [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c88abdbabba9ba88bba0bde6adacbd).

**Q. How do I set up a payment plan?**  
Seton Hall University offers interest-free payment plans that provide you with flexibility
and time to meet your financial obligation. The payment plan is an option that breaks
down the large-sum payments due at the beginning of each semester into easy-to-manage
installments. Each semester, you can spread your payments over five or seven months,
with the final payment due prior to registration for next term. There currently is
no payment plan available for summer terms.

To set-up a payment plan, log into PirateNet, locate the Profile and Finances tab,
click "View and Pay My Account" to reach the payment portal. Through here, you can
select the Payment Plan tab.

**Q: When is orientation?**  
Pirate Adventure (Summer Orientation) for first-year students is held in late June.
Transfer orientation is held in late August. The specific dates for your orientation
can be found in your admission letter. Once you pay your tuition deposit you will
receive a username and password to logon to PirateNet. Once you logon to PirateNet,
you can confirm your attendance at orientation.

**Q: Do I need to buy a laptop?**  
No. All full-time undergraduate students receive a University-issued laptop, which
they can keep after graduation. This laptop is part of the Mobile Computing program
and allows state-of-the-art technology to be integrated into the curriculum.

**Q: What is PirateNet?**  
[PirateNet](https://piratenet.shu.edu) is your one stop portal for all things Seton Hall. It is how you will view your financial
aid package, your class schedule, pay your bill, register for classes and so much
more. If you have submitted your non-refundable $350 tuition deposit, you will receive
your username and password to logon to PirateNet starting in early February.

**Q: How do I register for classes? When will I meet my advisor?**  
All new students will meet their academic advisor and register for classes at orientation.
For freshmen this is called New Student Orientation. Your orientation dates can be
found in your admission letter. During orientation, you will also get your laptop,
student ID card and meet fellow classmates.

**Q: What is your deposit deadline?**  
Our deposit deadline is **May 1**. The tuition deposit is $350 and is non-refundable after **May 1**. The housing deposit is $375 and is also non-refundable after **May 1**. If you want to reserve your spot at Seton Hall, we suggest you submit this by the
deadline. In previous years, shortly after **May 1**, we had to stop taking deposits because our class was full.

**Q: If I'm accepted, can I defer my admission, and for how long?**  
Your admission decision can be deferred for up to one year. A request must be submitted
to the Office of Admissions via email. Please complete the [Deferment Application Form](/documents/Seton-Hall-University-Deferment-Application.pdf) and be sure to include your student ID number. Your completed form can be sent to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e094888588818c8ca0938895ce858495). If you defer your admission, your University Scholarships (if applicable) will also
be deferred for up to one year. Students can defer at any point in the admission cycle:
they can defer their application, their admission or their deposit. All deferrals
last one year. During the deferral period, you cannot attend another university. If
you do, you will have to reapply as a transfer student and will lose any scholarship
you may have received.

**Q: Why do we have to pay a fee for Mobile Computing?**  
As part of the Mobile Computing Program all students receive a laptop computer. However,
Mobile Computing is much more than just giving a student a laptop computer, we are
utilizing technology to enhance the classroom experience, integrate technology into
the learning process, creating a more learner-centered environment and preparing students
with valuable skills.

All students are required to participate in the Mobile Computing Program.The Mobile Computing fee covers not just the laptop, which you are permitted to keep
upon graduation, but also includes the $3,000 worth of software on the laptops, the
Web space provided to students, the email account, the access throughout campus, the
network upkeep, the development of educational integration, the help desk and repair
services, etc. Most universities charge students a technology fee for access to computers and email.
We are charging a similar fee, which is higher but also includes much more than most
other Universities.

**Q: What if I want to change my major?**  
If you want to change your major prior the start of classes, please contact the Office
of Admissions at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1064787578717c7c506378653e757465) or 973-313-6146 and they will determine if this change can be made.

**Q: Can my admission to Seton Hall be rescinded?**  
Admission to Seton Hall University is at the University’s discretion and remains contingent
upon the student maintaining appropriate grades, successfully completing the student’s
current program, and engaging in conduct that is considered by the University to be
appropriate. Conduct that is considered inappropriate may include, but is not limited
