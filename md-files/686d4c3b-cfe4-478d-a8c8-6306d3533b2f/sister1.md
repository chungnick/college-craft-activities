Teen Internship Program 2016-2025

### Program Overview

The Build a Better Book project began in 2016 to study youth engagement in STEM through the design and creation of accessible materials using low- and high-tech maker technologies. In phase 2 of the project (*Empathy-Driven Engineering Internships for Teens: Connecting Technical Work to Social Needs;*2021-25), we focused more specifically on teens' interests in STEM careers by examining the influences of a professionally-structured, empathy-driven engineering internship on teens’ perceptions of engineering, identities, and transferrable STEM skills. We implemented and studied this internship model across several diverse formal and informal education settings, including a university-based summer internship program (CO), a public library makerspace (NJ), a science center (NM), a makerspace/entrepreneurship non-profit organization (MA), and a faith-based high school (NJ).

Build a Better Book (BBB) was pleased to offer high school students the opportunity to participate in an immersive engineering and design internship and research project focused on using Maker technologies to create accessible materials for blind or visually impaired clients.  
  
Through the internship, student interns learned about and completed projects using:

* Universal Design principles and empathy-driven design
* Accessibility tools and designing for disabilities
* Maker Technologies such as 3D modeling and printing, sound, computer programming and laser cutters
* Tactile and multi-modal learning styles
* Characteristics of blindness, vision impairments, and other disabilities
* Job skills and designing for a specific client
* Professional workplace skills, including communication, collaboration and critical problem-solving skills
