### Overview

The Build a Better Book Teen Internship at the University of Colorado Boulder was a 4-week paid summer internship based on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Each year, 12-16 interns from a variety of high schools in the Denver metro area completed a 100-120 hour internship, working in teams to fabricate accessible products for community clients. TVIs from partner organizations provided client profiles and project ideas for intern design projects. Client profiles typically included pre-school/kindergarten children with cortical visual impairment (CVI) and mobility challenges, as well as middle and high school students with blindness and low vision. Working in teams of 2-4 students, interns collaborated with their community client to design, fabricate, test and improve an accessible product that could be shared with the client at the end of the program.

### Program Structure

The 4-week BBB Teen Internship was designed to provide interns with an authentic engineering design experience in a workplace setting. For most of the internship, students worked collaboratively in project teams to design and produce a product for a community client. Additional experiences, including campus field trips, tours and guest speakers, complemented this hands-on learning. Through the internship, students developed an understanding of:

* Universal Design principles and empathy-driven design
* Accessibility tools and designing for disabilities
* Tactile and multi-modal learning styles
* Maker Technologies, such as 3D modeling and printing, sound, computer programming (e.g., Arduino, microbit, Makerbit, GameMaker), electronics, and laser cutters
* Characteristics of blindness, vision impairments, and other disabilities
* 21st century workplace skills

##### *Note: Due to the end of our grant funding, Build a Better Book is no longer running High School Internship programs.*

### Year 1 - Summer 2022 (pilot program)

CU Boulder hosted its pilot Engineering and Design Teen Summer Internship in summer 2022. Interns in the four-week program completed 30-35 hours per week, for a total of ~120 hours. Students designed and built tactile and accessible books and games for blind and low vision clients at the Anchor Center for Blind Children, Boulder Valley School District, Douglas County School District, and St. Joseph's School for the Blind.
