## MOLECULAR MEDICINE WORKSHOPS

We offer a variety of workshops on molecular medicine for high-achieving high school and middle school students interested in pursuing careers in medicine or related fields, such as biomedical research, drug development, pharmacy or nursing. Camps are offered in summer and winter and there are online and in-person options available, including residential camps held at some of the world’s best universities.

Workshops are taught by PhD-level instructors with years of research and teaching experience. Through engaging lectures and hands-on labs, students learn normal molecular and cellular biology, and then learn how these normal processes are disrupted or distorted during the development of disease. In addition, there is a heavy emphasis on experimental design, modern drug development, and the emergence of the era of personalized medicine. To conclude the workshop, students use what they have learned to create an original research project on a gene or molecular process of their choice. More broadly, workshop attendees strengthen their academic skills, build their college portfolio, and explore potential career options while making friends from around the world and experiencing college dorm life in a safe environment.

Our university-based workshops are held at UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Columbia University, and University College London, and both residential and commuter options are available. Residential students are housed in on-campus undergraduate dorms and eat in campus dining facilities. Teaching assistants/residential advisors live with the students and are available to mentor and assist the students. In addition, the camp directors are on-site 24 hours/day. Overall, we maintain a student-to-staff ratio that is better than the universities require.

University-based workshops include Molecular Neuroscience, Molecular Biology of Cancer, Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology of Aging, Molecular Immunology, and several different versions of Bioinformatics (AI-Enhanced Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics of Cancer, Bioinformatics of Aging, Cancer Bioinformatics with R, Neurologic Bioinformatics, and Immunologic Bioinformatics).

Biomedical Research is a commuter-only workshop held at our facility in Alameda, CA.

Our online workshops include Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medicinal Chemistry, FutureMD, and Medical Bioinformatics. Intro to Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Future MD are our entry-level workshops that are only two hours/day. Students in the Medicinal Chemistry and Medical Bioinformatics workshops learn how to use online tools to analyze biochemical data. For students interested in doing research or working on a project for a science fair, this is a great way to get started.

#### University of California, San Diego

Located on the bluffs above the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, UCSD ranks 5th in the US in research funding and it was named the world’s 14th best university. Sixteen Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the school, and its undergraduate programs, medical school and graduate school are ranked among the best in the country.

#### Columbia University

Located in the heart of New York City, Columbia University is a center of research and culture and the the 9th-ranked global university.  In total, 87 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the university, including ten current faculty.

#### University College London

Situated in London, University College is one the flagship universities in the renowned UK higher education system.  University College is the 7th-ranked global university, a leader in medical research, and the school has been home to 32 Nobel Laureates.

2026 Summer Online and Commuter-Only Workshops

**Summer Commuter Workshop:**

Biomedical Research is a commuter-only workshop held at our facility in Alameda, CA 6/16–6/26, and 8/4-8/14.  Students from outside the area are welcome to attend but there are no accommodations provided.

Ages 14-18. Roughly 9am-5pm M-F with weekend activities. Application and letter of recommendation required. See Curriculum and Apply/Finances tabs for additional information.

**Summer Online Workshops:**

1. FutureMD: Oncology – 5/18-5/29 (4pm, 6pm) (all PST), 2 hr/day M-F. Ages **12**-18.

2. Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Medicine – 6/8-6/19 (6am, 2pm, 6pm) (all PST), 2 hr/day M-F. Ages **12**-18.

3. Medicinal Chemistry – 7/6-7/17 (AM, PM), 3 hours/day M-F. Ages 14-18.

4. Medical Bioinformatics – 6/22-7/3, and 8/3-8/14, 5.5 hours/day M-F. Ages 13-18.

All online workshops require an application but no letter of recommendation.

### Winter Break Workshops:

1. There is an abbreviated version of the Biomedical Research workshop during winter break (12/26-12/31). This workshop (commuter-only) is held at our facility in Alameda, CA.  
2. Cancer Research (commuter-only) is held at our facility in Berkeley, CA 12/26-12/31. This workshop is similar to the Biomedical Research workshop, but there is a greater emphasis on cancer biology to give the labs additional context.  
3. The Medical Bioinformatics workshop and the Medicinal Chemistry workshops will be held online during winter break (12-26-12/30, approximately 6 hrs/day PST).

All Winter workshops require an application but no letter of recommendation.
