There is no application deadline, but students are encouraged to apply as soon as possible because suitable candidates are accepted on a rolling basis, and applying early increases the likelihood of securing your first-choice workshop.  A letter of recommendation is required for in-person summer workshops, but not required for winter workshops and all online workshops.  A link to the recommendation form can be found at the bottom of the application page.

Be sure to add [info@rosettainstitute.org](mailto:info@rosettainstitute.org) to your email client’s “safe list” or address book to prevent our emails (including your possible acceptance) from being filtered into the spam folder.

If you would like to attend more than one workshop, please indicate this in a separate email.

## Winter Workshops 2025

Winter break workshops are online and in-person.  The online Medicinal Chemistry (12/26-12/30) and online Medical Bioinformatics (12/26-12/30) workshops are $670 and run approximately 8am-4pm PST.
