### FUNDRAISING TIPS

* State your purpose clearly

* State the amount you wish to raise and the progress you've made in your campaign
* **Always** remember to write a thank-you note when you receive a donation

There is no one magic formula. A combination of creativity and effort will often yield positive results. Once students move past their initial hesitation to ask, they find that people, organizations and communities are remarkably willing to join them in their mission to make Pre-College happen

#### Grassroots Campaigns

Here are some suggestions that students have used for grassroots fundraising campaigns of their own.

* Letter writing to friends, family, employers, local businesses and churches.
* Social media to spread the word.
* Research civic organizations, such as Rotary and Kiwanis, for financial support.
* Check with your school's student clubs and consider modeling activities they use to raise money.

#### Crowdfunding

With great effort and planning, students can raise money through websites designed to help fundraise. Sharing your story and why the program is important to you will encourage others, including those you don't know, to support your mission. Start early and remember to share your fundraising efforts with your friends and family. Consistently use social media to spread the word.
