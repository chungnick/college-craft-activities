## 2026 Tuition & Fees for CED Summer Programs

The tuition for the credit-bearing [CED Summer programs](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs) (embARC, DISC, Summer Institutes) is **US$3,900**. Additional UC Berkeley Summer Sessions charges and fees apply to all students, including but not limited to the following:

* Summer Sessions registration fee: **$25** (non-UC students only)
* Document Management fee: **$73** (visiting students only)
* UC Berkeley Registration fee: **$585** (non-UC students only)
* Unit Charge: **$635** per unit (1 unit for domestic visiting students; the unit fee is lower for current UC and UC Berkeley students); note: international students need 5 units to apply for a student visa
* International service fee: **$500** (international students only)
* Visit [Summer Session Fees](http://summer.berkeley.edu/application/fees) for further details on these university fees

These fees do not include housing. **Exact tuition, charges, and fees vary depending on student status and the number of units. CLICK [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O92Ksc97uN1z2TzLaSuRPcDwG8oJTQBO/view?usp=sharing) to view some typical examples.**

NOTE: Figures for tuition, charges, and fees represent currently approved or proposed amounts and may not be final. Actual tuition, charges, and fees are subject to change by the CED Summer Programs and the University of California as determined to be necessary or appropriate. Final approved tuition, charges, and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.

IMPORTANT: Tuition, charges, and fees are typically assessed within 24 hours upon enrollment in [CalCentral](http://calcentral.berkeley.edu/). Please check after 24 hours for your full balance. Students are not automatically dropped from a CED Summer program for non-payment or non-attendance in the summer term. If you do not plan to attend, you must notify your CED Summer program AND drop your class before the refund deadlines, or you will be financially responsible for all tuition, charges, and fees.

The program costs above do not include the initial **US$82** CED Summer Program application processing fee.

### Payment Policy for ALL programs

All CED Summer Program fees must be paid in full to guarantee your spot, or students **may** be dropped from the program. All tuition and fees must be paid in full prior to the beginning of the program.

IMPORTANT: CED Summer Program students are not automatically dropped from the program for non-payment or non-attendance. If you do not plan to attend, you are solely responsible to notify your CED Summer program via email AND drop your class before the refund deadlines (see below), or you will be financially responsible for all tuition and fees. Enrolling in a CED Summer Program after the cancellation deadline for full tuition refund means that you accept financial responsibility for all program tuition and fees.

## Financial Assistance

There is a small number of scholarships available for CED Summer Program students. These financial aid funds are **need-based awards**, which means that funding is based on the financial situation of the student and their family and household, if applicable. CED Summer program financial aid takes into account many factors, including gross household income of the applicant and, for most students, their parents. We aim to award financial assistance to those applicants who identify the greatest need while gaining a significant relative benefit by attending the program.

To apply, submit your answers and documentation to the financial assistance questions as part of the online CED Summer Program application **by the deadline** which is indicated in your program. Financial aid recipients will be notified by email, as part of their admission letter.

*Please Note:* CED Summer Program financial aid is not federally subsidized and is available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents only. Other important items to consider:

* International students are not eligible to apply.
* Applications after the deadline stated in your program will not be considered for financial aid.
* There is no guarantee that applicants who apply for aid will receive financial assistance.
* Award amounts vary, depending on the needs of the applicant pool and availability of funds.
* Applicants who receive a partial scholarship (stipend) will be required to pay the full balance of the program fees prior to the start of the program.
* Applicants who are offered financial support are expected to inform us immediately if they plan on accepting it.
* Students who have accepted financial support from CED Summer Programs and decide not to join the program need to inform us immediately.

Applicants and admitted students are encouraged to research and apply for **additional funding opportunities**, which might include funds from your home school/college/university, foundations, your government, regional scholarship funds, or stipends based on other criteria. A College Savings Plan (529 Plan), veteran education benefits, or the AmeriCorp Education Award may be additional funding option.

Other funding possibilities could include support from an employer, local business, civic organization, an institution of worship, or a loan supplement. We also had students who have succeeded in fundraising, for example through a crowd-funding campaign. We encourage you to investigate all options.

In addition, you may review this [list of scholarship databases](https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/scholarship-databases/). It primarily applies to full-time students, but you may find an opportunity that applies to your personal situation. ArchCareersGuide also publishes and updates a [list of regional and national scholarships](https://www.archcareersguide.com/resources-scholarships/) which could be a starting point.
