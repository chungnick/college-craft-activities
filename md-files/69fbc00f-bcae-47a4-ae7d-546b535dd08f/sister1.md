Financial Aid

### Financial Aid

---

#### Availability of Awards

Tufts Pre-College Programs are committed to aiding students from all backgrounds. Although we have only limited financial aid available, we do our best to distribute the funds to students for whom it can make the greatest difference in their ability to attend.

Financial aid awards are made on a rolling basis to students with demonstrated need. We aim to provide enough aid to eligible students so that they are able to successfully enroll and participate in the program. Seasonal aid awards are as follows:

* **Fall**: We currently do not offer aid for the Fall term.
* **Spring:** We currently do no offer aid for the Spring term.
* **Summer:** We will typically distribute awards twice monthly beginning in February and will continue until the enrollment deadline or until aid is fully distributed.

Please note:

* International students are not eligible for financial aid due to federal and tax guidelines. Families should expect to contribute to the remaining portion of the program cost, as well as other expenses like travel, books, etc.

#### Process

1. Complete the Admissions Application for the Pre-College Program you would like to attend.
2. During the application process, you will be asked to indicate whether you are interested in being considered for financial aid.
3. After submission, you will have the option of completing a financial aid application in your student portal.
4. We will review your financial aid application. Your financial aid application will be considered for the next monthly aid award(s).
5. If you receive an award,
   1. You will be notified by email of the amount of the award.
   2. You will have 6 days (including weekends and holidays) to accept the award by completing your Financial Aid Award Form and submitting your deposit.
   3. Tufts Pre-College Programs will then credit your student account with the amount of financial aid you received.
   4. Please note: Your enrollment in the program is still contingent on payment of any remaining balance after the award is applied to your account, and on receiving your enrollment forms.
6. If you do not receive an award, you will be notified via email.

Post-Enrollment Materials

### Post-Enrollment Materials

Note that not all of our programs offer housing. We will be unable to admit an international student into a commuter-only program without consent and a waiver indicating that the student has housing and transportation provided by a close relative within 50 miles of Tufts. Both the parent and the close relative must sign the waiver.

Please note that visa delays or denials are not recognized reasons for refunds; it is the student's responsibility to apply for the relevant visa type with enough time for processing and arrival. Tufts cannot guarantee success in the visa process — students take this risk upon themselves.

## Creating a Strong Tufts Application

When you’re preparing your Tufts Pre-College application, the best way to differentiate yourself is with your academic transcripts and a letter of recommendation. Choose a teacher, coach, or mentor who can provide detailed information about your educational background, passion for your chosen specialty, and curiosity as a learner.

The Tufts Pre-College application review board does not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. We evaluate each student based on the overall strength of their application and their willingness to explore new opportunities.

## Why Choose a Tufts Pre-College Program?

Here’s why you (as a motivated high schooler) should consider sending in a Tufts Pre-College application:

* You’ve picked a renowned research institution ranked #16 in the country for long-term career results (LinkedIn Top Colleges 2025)
* You’ll be part of a community of ambitious students in a supportive atmosphere
* You can experience real college-level coursework
* You’ll position yourself ahead of your peers
* You’ll access small class sizes, meaningful interactions, and world-class faculty

Becoming part of the Tufts community is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In each pre-college program, we aim to guide you through the next phase of your educational journey.

## Application Review and Next Steps
