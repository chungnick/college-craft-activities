How do I access the Parent Permission Form?

As a part of your application, you will be asked to provide your parent/guardian name and contact information.

So be sure to enter an email address that your parent checks regularly!

Can I send my transcript via email?

You are welcome to have your high school transcript sent via email. However, in order for your transcript to be marked as official, the transcript needs to be sent by a representative of your high school.

How do I make my application stronger?

Your strongest application is the one in which the person you truly are shines through. We don’t publish a Tufts Pre-College Program acceptance rate, as our Pre-College Program staff evaluates all materials holistically. Make sure you choose a teacher, coach, or mentor who can provide detailed information about your educational background, passion for your chosen specialty, and curiosity as a learner.

## International Students

Can international students apply for Pre-College Programs?

Yes. We welcome international students who have the educational background, English Language skills, and funding to attend our Tufts Pre-College Programs.

**After you are admitted and have submitted a program deposit to TCE, you will receive further instructions to request your Form I-20, which is required for your F-1 visa application.**

How will my child receive care if they need medical attention while on your programs?

Please see our [Health & Wellness](/high-school/university-resources/health-wellness) sections on program pages for details about treatment for acute illness or emergencies. Note that should your child need to receive unexpected medical care during one of our programs, their emergency contact will be notified if provided.

Students in our residential programs will be asked to provide details regarding specific, ongoing medical conditions (e.g., allergies), and our residential partner will assist in addressing these concerns.

## Pre-College Program Communication

Can parents access their Pre-College students’ educational records?

Parents aren’t granted automatic access to their students’ educational records. Due to the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students enrolled in a university hold the privacy rights to their records, regardless of their age. Additional [FERPA details](https://students.tufts.edu/registrar/forms-and-policies/education-privacy-ferpa) regarding disclosure are available on the Tufts website.

### **Details**

Tufts Pre-College summer programs may include parents in admissions communications prior to enrollment, especially as parent/guardian permission is required for application. Enrolled students may fill out and submit a Consent to Disclose Student Information form to authorize the release of their educational records.

How will Tufts communicate with my student?

Email is our primary form of communication with your student. Remind your student to check their email regularly and respond promptly to avoid delays and increased costs.

### **Details**

The application for Tufts Pre-College summer programs for high schoolers asks for a parent’s email address to send important information, such as the Parent Permission Form and enrollment forms. Please make sure you provide an address that’s checked often.

Students enrolled in any of our programs will set up a Tufts email account as part of their Tufts network login profile. They’ll use this to access critical course applications and receive important communications throughout the program.

## Earning & Transferring Credit for Pre-College Programs

Can I earn Tufts credit?

The ability to earn credit varies by program.

### **Details**

Please see the table below for the credit options within each program.

**Credit options by program**

| Program | Credit Options |
| --- | --- |
| Tufts Dual Enrollment | Courses can be taken for credit or for audit. If you would like to audit a course, you can indicate this option when you register online. Please see the individual courses for the number of credits offered per course. |
| Tufts College Experience | Courses will be taken for credit. Please see the individual courses for the number of credits offered per course. |
| Tufts Summer Research Experience | Not for credit. |
| Business Essentials  Coding for Gaming  College Prep 101 for Neurodivergent Student  Engineering Design Lab  Engineering Investigations  Engineering with Artificial Intelligence  Engineering of Music  Entrepreneurship & Innovation Bootcamp  Finance Essentials  Lab Science Investigations  Marketing Essentials  Mini Med School  Mini Dental School  Studio Art at SMFA  Tufts College Accelerator | Not for credit |
| Climate Resilience Institute  International Relations  Leadership for Social Change | For credit (1 credit) |

Will this credit transfer?

While most students report success in transferring their credits, we can’t guarantee that all credits will transfer. Each college and university has policies and procedures that determine whether they will accept college credit earned elsewhere and, importantly, what the credit counts for. Please confirm with the institution of interest that credits transfer.

How does my student transfer the credit earned at Tufts?

After your student’s course or program is complete, an academic transcript can be requested from Tufts Student Services. With this document, your student can request transfer credit at the college or University he or she will attend.

If your student attends Tufts as an undergraduate, he or she can speak with his or her academic dean to see how the credit that was earned in a Tufts Pre-College Program can be added to their plan of study.

Remember, each college and university has policies and procedures that determine whether or not they will accept college credit earned elsewhere. Earning credit at Tufts is not a guarantee that the course will transfer. However, we have seldom heard of a situation in which Tufts credit has not been accepted at another higher education institution.

Will this credit transfer to my high school?

Tufts cannot guarantee that these courses or programs can be used at your high school. Students should be in touch with their schools to determine what is possible. Tufts is happy to provide a transcript upon request.

## Financial Information for Pre-College Programs

Is There Financial Aid Available for Tufts Summer Programs for High School Students?

Limited financial aid is available and will be distributed based on demonstrated student need. This reflects Tufts University’s commitment to welcoming students from all backgrounds.

### **Details**

Many of the programs offer a limited number of scholarships, typically covering 75-100% of the program fee based on demonstrated need. Award decisions will be issued twice per month. For more information, please consult the information on the program pages.

How is tuition billed and paid?

Most programs require a tuition deposit upon your acceptance of the offer of enrollment. Once the deposit is paid, you’ll be billed for the remaining tuition. 

### **Details**

Be on the lookout for communication from precollege@tufts.edu once you have accepted your place in the program for more details.

You can also visit our [Billing & Payments](https://universitycollege.tufts.edu/high-school/policies/billing-payment) page for additional information, including details on payment for Courses at Tufts for High Schoolers. All deposit and tuition payments can be made via the [application portal](https://ies.admissions.tufts.edu/account/login?cookie=1).

Can I get a refund?

### Can I get a refund?

---

Students who officially withdraw from a course are eligible for a tuition refund based on the date of withdrawal (when the official request to withdraw was received). The refund schedules vary based on the length of the course/program type. Most programs have a refund deadline of May 15th.

Please [go to the Refund Policy](/about/policies) page to learn more.

## Pre-College Program Room & Board

## Pre-College Program Safety

What precautions do you take to ensure my child will be safe on this program?

### What precautions do you take to ensure my child will be safe on this program?

---

Tufts University takes the safety of its students very seriously. More information can be found on each program page and the [Campus Safety page](https://publicsafety.tufts.edu/).

Regardless of the program, all of our classroom courses take place on Tufts’ campuses (with the exception of any course-sponsored field trips). Tufts makes reasonable efforts to ensure that instructors of programs or courses that are open to high school students and program staff who will spend significant time with high school students receive a background check and attend Title IX training to participate in the program.

Our residential programs maintain strict chaperone and staff-to-student ratios of 1:10 and provide ample training to ensure students remain safe during the program.

## Pre-College Program Online Courses

Can I take a course online?

### Can I take a course online?

---

High school students are welcome to take online courses in several of our programs— however, the format for taking an online course differs depending on which program you choose:

If you are a student who only wants to take a course or two without having to come onto campus, you should register for the online course of your choice via Tufts Dual Enrollment. You can take an online course from anywhere in the world — provided you have a reliable internet connection. Online courses are still high-engagement courses that will allow you greater flexibility within your summer schedule.

If you are interested in an online course but would like to have the experience of living on campus, you should register for the Tufts College Experience. Within this program, you will take two courses or seminars — and we recommend that a **maximum** of one of these be online if necessary.
