It is the student's responsibility to review and understand all policies applicable to them. Please email us at <courses@tufts.edu> or <precollege@tufts.edu> if you have any questions about the policies or their applicability to you. Note that all policies are subject to change without notice.

*Last updated November 2025.*

Grading System

Students participating in credit-bearing University College programs will earn the same college credit as matriculated Tufts University students in the same courses. At the end of the term, an academic transcript will be available for you by request.

* Not all courses or programs run by University College are graded or for credit courses or programs. See the individual program page for details on your program and write to us at courses@tufts.edu with any questions.
* If you were in a graded course or program, you can review your Tufts University grades by logging-on to Tufts SIS ([go.tufts.edu/sis](http://go.tufts.edu/sis)), the university’s web-based student information system. You will need your Tufts User ID and password. For assistance, contact Tufts Student Services, 617-627-2000.

For graded courses, the standing of the student in each subject is expressed by one of the following letters.

* **A**. Superior work.
* **B**. Meritorious work.
* **C**. Work without marked merit or defect.
* **COM, I**. Complete, incomplete. Instructors should assign these grades to auditors taking continuing education classes
* **CR**, **NC**. Credit, no credit.
* **D**. Unsatisfactory work but allowable for credit, subject to the restrictions specified under the requirements for graduation. Some departments disallow credit toward the concentration requirement.
* **P**. Passing work (D- or better) for courses taken under the pass-fail option, and for selected courses offered only pass-fail by departments. Grade point average is not affected. Students may select this option without the faculty member’s knowledge.
* **PI**. Permanent Incomplete. Do not assign this grade. All incomplete grades will turn into permanent incompletes six weeks into the following semester.
* **F**. Failure; no credit is received. A grade of F is included in the grade point average.

Withdrawal

Depending on the date of your Official Withdrawal request, your student transcript will be impacted accordingly. Students must make all decisions about their enrollments in line with the deadlines published on the academic calendar. *Please note: withdrawal deadlines are not the same as refund deadlines.*

* **Withdrawal - No Record of Attendance (without a "W")**:  You can withdraw from your course or courses any time before 11:59 p.m. ET on or before the “Last day to withdraw without a W” (noted on the academic calendar) and the course registration(s) will be deleted entirely from your record.
* **Withdrawal - Record of Attendance (with a "W")**: If you choose to withdraw after 11:59 p.m. ET on or before the “Last day to withdraw with W” (noted on the academic calendar), your student record will be marked with a withdrawal grade of “W.”
* **No Withdrawal Permitted**: No withdrawal from a course or courses in the current term is permitted after the “Last day to withdraw with “W.” Grades from these courses will appear on your transcript.
* **How to Withdraw**: Proper notification of your intention to drop or withdraw from your course(s) or program(s) is necessary in order to be un-enrolled in those course(s) or program(s) and/or to be eligible for a refund on charges or payments made to Tufts University for that registration. *A record of an email request to faculty about dropping a course is not considered an official withdrawal request. Students are responsible for understanding the policies and deadlines when they register.*  
  Until the official notification is received, tuition will be charged and students will be responsible for payment.

  + Courses at Tufts (including Summer Session, Winter Session Courses, Workshops)

    - Tufts Students: Log-on to the Tufts Student Information System and DROP each course registration.
    - Visiting students: Log-on to the Courses at Tufts platform and request a DROP each course registration. Email <courses@tufts.edu> if you have trouble.
  + Tufts Pre-College Programs and K-8 Design & Engineering Workshops: All requests for withdrawal must be made in writing to <precollege@tufts.edu>.
  + Tufts Campaign School: All requests for withdrawal must be made in writing to <courses@tufts.edu>.

Auditing

Some University College courses may be available on an audit (not-for-credit) basis. Auditing students will not receive a final grade for the course or program, but the course or program will still appear on your transcript as “Audit.” Please discuss expectations with your instructor regarding your engagement as an auditing student. Some instructors expect full participation with the course and all assignments to earn the Audit designation on the transcript. Failure to meet instructor expectations for the audit may result in the removal of the audit designation from the transcript without a refund.

* If you register to audit a course and later decide that you would like to switch to a graded course structure, you must:

  1. Submit written instructor approval; note that it is at the discretion of the instructor if this change would be permitted;
  2. Request this change prior to the Add Deadline by emailing <courses@tufts.edu>;
  3. Pay the difference in tuition.
* If you are registered for credit and later decide to audit the course, you must:

  1. Request this change prior to the Add Deadline by emailing <courses@tufts.edu>;
  2. Depending on the date of the request you may not be eligible for a refund of the tuition difference.

Incomplete

A student, who due to unusual circumstance is unable to complete the work of a course by the end of the semester, may request permission from the instructor to take a grade of incomplete. An "incomplete" indicates that the instructor has allowed you more time to complete the requirements for the course. Incompletes may only be awarded if you have done substantial work in the course and the instructor believes there are valid reasons for granting an incomplete. We recommend that instructors do not consider giving an Incomplete unless over 75% of the course work has been completed.

* To request an incomplete, first speak with your professor to discuss the details of an incomplete and timelines for submitting the work. The decision to allow a grade of incomplete, with or without a reduction of grade for lateness, is at the discretion of the instructor.

* Next, the instructor must submit an Incomplete form. (The Incomplete form may be found on the faculty SIS homepage under "Faculty Forms".) The instructor is responsible for specifying on the form the deadline for submission of work and the conditions that the student must satisfy to receive a grade.
* If the work is not completed by the deadline, the professor will calculate the grade to reflect the impact of the missing work on overall course grade and submit the final grade through the Grade Edit feature on SIS. Or, in some circumstances, the professor may decide to let the Incomplete stand as a Permanent Incomplete (but the student will not earn credit for the course).
* The work for all courses must be reviewed and graded by the faculty member with whom the course was taken. Please note University College does not guarantee that all instructors will be available outside of the specific term of the course offering.

* Fall term deadline for submitted work: 6 weeks into the spring term
* Spring: start of the fall term

* Summer 1 and 2: start of fall term

Nonparticipation

Non-attendance, discontinuity of study, abandonment of study, or abandonment of registration are not forms of official withdrawal from a course. If you stop attending class(es), you will not automatically be administratively withdrawn, and no refund will be issued.

* Failure to notify the university of your intention to discontinue your enrollment or registration, will result in your continuing to be charged. These charges will be enforced, balances are subject to a late payment surcharge, and/or your balance may be transferred to a collection agency for action.
* The responsibility to learn rests squarely on the enrolled student. Consistent and on-time attendance, active interaction with others in the course or program, and steady engagement with the instructor and course or program content is expected. Attendance at all meetings of your course or program is required, unless otherwise noted by your instructor or program director. If enrolled students are not keeping up or not able to maintain active engagement with the instructor and course, they must take action and ask for assistance.
* Absences may result in a grade reduction, course failure, and/or dismissal from the program with no refund.
* If you are unable to attend due to illness or an emergency, it is your responsibility to contact the course instructor or program director to make arrangements to complete missed work.

Holds

A "Hold" is a flag placed on your record indicating an outstanding obligation or an additional level of approval required for any action. Multiple withdrawals related to nonpayment may result in a registration hold prior to payment. Holds must be resolved prior to enrollment. Holds may be issued for:

* *Previous Administrative Withdrawal*: If you are administratively withdrawn from a course/ program two times for any reason a Hold for future registrations may be placed on your account. In order to remove this hold, payment in full in advance may be required.
* *Delinquent Requirement*s: Certain documentation is required for participation in UC offerings. A Hold may be placed on your account if records show missing paperwork, such as a transcript or note on past academic probation. In order to remove this hold, the requested pending paperwork/ documentation must be marked as received.
* *Outstanding Balance*: If you have an outstanding payment balance from a previous term but was not withdrawn for any reason (e.g. registration fees for remission students), a Hold for future registrations may be placed on your account. In order to remove this hold, payment in full in advance may be required.

Tufts Academic Credit

The Tufts course load system is expressed in credit hours. Courses may award anywhere from 1 credit hour to 5 credit hours depending on the contact hours of the class. The number of credit hours awarded will be indicated clearly in the course list.

* For Tufts Pre-College Programs, please remember that only some programs and students are eligible for credit. Your eligibility to receive Tufts University academic credit was indicated in your admission letter. Students taking credit-bearing pre-college courses who subsequently matriculate into Tufts are required to include those courses on their transcript. The grade for those courses will be permanently on the student’s academic record.
* Please note that not all programs or courses offer credit and not all students choose to enroll in courses for credit (i.e., they may be auditing). Please consult your program or course page if you have any questions or write to <courses@tufts.edu>.

Transcripts

The official document which verifies your attendance and grade earned at Tufts University is called a transcript. This document is provided by the Office of the University Registrar upon request. More information may be found [here](https://students.tufts.edu/registrar/make-request/transcriptsdiplomas).

Transferring Credit

The extent to which any credit will transfer into another institution or a future degree or certificate program is up to the discretion of that institution or program.

* If you later attend Tufts as an undergraduate or graduate, courses or programs that you took for credit may apply to your Tufts degree. Contact your program after admission for approval and processing of any eligible credit.
* If you attend a degree program elsewhere, you may be able to transfer any Tufts credit you earned in a course or program. Please note that each university has specific policies concerning which and how many courses may be transferred.

Maximum Credit Limits

* Non-degree (visiting) students are eligible to enroll in up to 8 credits per term.
* Tufts (matriculated) students may take up to two courses during each session in the summer.

Virtual Offering Requirements

Students enrolling in virtual courses and programs must have regular access to a computer with a reliable, high-speed internet connection. Students are expected to log into Canvas and check email daily and need regular and reliable access to the internet using a laptop or desktop computer manufactured in the past five years. For hardware and software requirement minimums, please see the computer specifications for Canvas. Individual courses may require students to have additional software. These requirements will be listed on the course syllabus and the Canvas course site.

Textbooks

Students are expected to purchase all of the required reading materials for each course or program. The cost of textbooks is not included in the course/ program feeds.

* To order textbooks in advance, check the Tufts University [Course Materials Finder](https://tufts.bncollege.com/course-material/course-finder?catalogId=10002&langId=-1&storeId=20051) or the syllabus for the course and term in which you are enrolling. If no information is available, a syllabus will be posted to the Canvas course page listing required books and readings. It is not expected that every student will have acquired the course textbook by the first day of the term or class. However, you should make the purchase as soon as you begin your course so that you have all the resources you need in order to succeed in the course.
* Textbooks can be purchase from the [Tufts bookstore](https://tufts.bncollege.com/) in the Mayer Campus Center (46 Professors Row) or through online book retailers.

Cancellation of a Single Course or Program Meeting

Only the President or the President’s designee can suspend, in part or totally, regularly scheduled academic or administrative activities at Tufts. The general University policy is not to cancel classes for snow or other emergencies, but rather to hold all class meetings that can reasonably be held. The decision to suspend regularly scheduled academic activities is made as far in advance as possible and announced by the Deans. Students can call 617-627-INFO for news about weather suspensions or check the Tufts web page (<http://www.tufts.edu)> and look under Announcements. Also, the University endeavors to have announcements made over Boston radio and television stations (WBZ AM 1030, WBZ TV Channel 4). Faculty members can also cancel classes if they cannot make it to campus due to the weather. Please note that some on-campus courses may be offered by web conferencing such as Zoom on days when the campus is closed due to weather or a temporary cancellation issue. Faculty will communicate directly with students about any changes to their class meeting.

Pre-College Attendance

### Daily Attendance before Programs

If the student's program has a bus trip in the morning, Residential Counselors traveling with students off campus will take attendance for all residential students before departing on the bus. If a student is missing, please notify the Pre-College and residential staff so they can locate them before the bus departs. It is the commuter's responsibility to be on campus before the bus departs.

### Attendance during Programs

Each day, attendance will be taken by program staff when students arrive to their programs in the morning and after lunch by program staff. If a student is not present, the residential staff and Pre-College team will be notified. Both parties will search for students in the dorms and contact the student as necessary. If the student is not located, the student's parents will be contacted immediately. Repeated issues with attendance is grounds for dismissal without refund.

### Attendance after Programs

When the academic program day ends, the residential team will follow protocols to ensure that all students are accounted for. This may include an in-person check-in before heading to dinner, or other protocols..

Pre-College International Student Classroom Attendance

### International Student Visa Attendance

Taking attendance is also important for students who are on an international visa. In this case, attendance in the program listed on the visa is a requirement of their legal status in the USA; any absences to any part of the program will be immediately escalated to the University College team. Please connect with the [International Student Center](https://icenter.tufts.edu/) on campus for any questions regarding your visa status and attendance expectations during your program to maintain status.

## Financial Policies

Billing

Billing at Tufts University is paperless and Tufts University's primary form of communication is email. Mailed paper invoices are not sent to students or to families.

* After registration and confirmation, you will be notified via email that charges have posted to your student account in the [Tufts Student Information System site](https://sis.it.tufts.edu/psp/paprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=PAPP_GUEST)(go.tufts.edu/sis). You will need a Tufts User ID and Password to access this information.
* Payment in full (including previous balances) is due upon notification of tuition and fee charges, but no later than the first day of the course session/term or the program payment deadline. Any previous outstanding balances must be paid at that time as well.
* Payment made after the first day of the course session or the program payment deadline is considered late, and balances may be subject to a late payment fee and/or other penalties and action (including withdrawal).

Payment Responsibility

It is your responsibility to pay your Tufts University tuition and fees on-time. Tufts University will post your charges to SIS and Tufts eBill, but it is important to understand that if you submit registration in the days just prior to the start of the session/term or the program payment deadline, charges may not post immediately. This does not reduce your obligation to clear your balance by no later than the first day of the course session/term or by the program payment deadline.

Outstanding Balances

Any account balance that remains on or after the first day of the course session with a summer and/or a prior balance may be subject to additional administrative action: Such actions may include, but are not limited to:

* Late Payment Fee (1.5% of the balance, compounded monthly)
* A registration hold
* A withdrawal of registration
* Transfer of balance to a collection agency (with all collection and service fees accruing to the student and a report made to the credit bureau)

Refunds

Students are only eligible for a refund when an official withdrawal request has been submitted. Please see the **official withdrawal policy** for details about this process.

**Refund Ineligible**

* **Disciplinary Removal**: There are no refunds of tuition or program fees charged or payments made, including any deposits paid, in cases where students are administratively withdrawn for violations of academic or student conduct policies.
* **Visa Delays**: Students assume all responsibility regarding the visa process; it is important to research the amount of time required for each visa type. Any delay or denial that results in the inability to participate in a program is not a recognized reason for a refund.
* **Program Modification**: By registering through a program at Tufts University, you agree that Tufts reserves the right, in its discretion, to modify its educational, extracurricular and other programs at any time, including, providing them remotely. Tuition and mandatory fees will not be refunded in that event.
* **Non-Participation**: There are no refunds of tuition or program fees charged or payments made, including any deposits paid, in cases where a student fails to continue the registration process by not submitting materials or payments, fails to participate in pre-departure activities, or fails to attend the program in part or in whole.

Deposits for Pre-College

A $550 non-refundable deposit for Pre-College programs must be received within 10 days of admission (inclusive of weekends and holidays) to secure your seat in the program until the payment deadline of May 15th, at which time enrollment is secured only by full tuition payment.

1098-T

Students enrolling in courses on a for-credit basis will be asked to provide their Social Security number, if available, at the time of application so that appropriate tax forms can be provided.

* The IRS requires schools to report either payments received for qualified tuition and fees or amounts billed for qualified tuition and fees during the calendar year on a form 1098-T. That form includes your Social Security number.
* Disclosure of your social security number gives student records personnel another point of identification in our student information system. Further, federal law requires that Tufts University provide tax payers with an IRS form 1098-T, which requires use of your social security number.

## Admissions Policies

Decisions

Tufts University reserves the right to determine admissibility to its courses and programs. For the criteria for entrance for a given course or program, please visit the course or program pages. Tufts University reserves the right to review and determine the admissibility of applicants based on findings during a review of past academic, behavioral, or criminal misconduct. Disclosure of offense(s), and a statement from officials at previous institutions will be required.

* Admissibility is based on the quality of credentials submitted by the applicant relative to the specific criteria outlined for the course or program. Tufts University reserves the right to admit as requested, to deny admission, or offer provisional admission. The program will not provide feedback to applicants when admission is denied. Tufts University reserves the right to deny admission to persons who are judged to not have disclosed requested biographical information or educational history with completeness and honesty. Further, admission may be denied to persons who are judged to not have adequate preparation for college-level study at Tufts University.
* Admissions decisions apply only the specific course or program into which you were admitted, based on the evaluation of admission credentials submitted to the Tufts University.

Documentation Requests

In some cases, a transcript, letter of recommendation, evidence of English language proficiency, instructor approval, or other documentation may be requested prior to confirming eligibility for a student to enroll in a particular course or program. Should these types of materials be requested, participation in the course will not be confirmed until they have been provided and approved by Tufts University. Students will receive email correspondence and, where possible, phone calls in such cases.

Official Enrollment

You are considered “Officially Enrolled” in your program or course when:

* Full payment for the program is completed and your tuition balance is cleared ($0)
* Any requested materials are received and approved by Tufts University.
* In the event that required forms are not returned by the stated program deadline, University College has the right to administratively withdraw a student from a course.  In this case, a refund may not be issued.
* A preview of the forms required for Pre-College programs <https://universitycollege.tufts.edu/node/39525>

Deposit and Waitlist Process (Pre-College only)

Many of our Pre-College programs will reach full capacity. When programs begin to fill, admitted students who have not finalized their payment and enrollment will be added to a waitlist. If seats become available, we will notify people on the waitlist.

* Before May 15: you can confirm your seat with a nonrefundable deposit. The full tuition payment deadline is May 15.
* After May 15 (the payment deadline): seats may only be confirmed with full tuition payment.

Age Requirements

Please note that persons under the age of 15 are not eligible for registration, unless otherwise specifically stated. In pre-college residential programs, students must be over 15 and under 19 years of age.

Course Readiness

Pre-requisite and prior study/learning recommendations are indicated in course or program descriptions, where possible. Please be aware of these indications when making course or program selections and email us at [courses@tufts.edu](mailto:courses@tufts.edu) should you have any questions. Misjudgment of your readiness to study in a course or program at Tufts University will not be considered as an extenuating circumstance if you withdraw after the no refund deadline.

Deferral of Admissions (Pre-College only)

Admission is granted for the specific student, program, and term stated in the admissions letter.  For pre-college programs, you may request a deferral to the following term with certain considerations.

Requests to defer admission to a specific course or program may be requested in advance of the May 1 deadline, but any deferred admission is still subject to all admissions processes and policies. Please note:

1. Students still need to submit all application materials by the deadlines
2. New letters of recommendation and new transcripts will be required
3. Tufts reserves the right to change the admissions decision based on the review of the new materials

A deposit will hold the admitted student's place in the program until May 1, at which point full tuition is due.  While May 1 is the Pre-College application deadline, programs may (and often do) fill in advance of this date, so we recommend sending all updated admissions materials in as soon as possible; a deferred seat is not guaranteed until all materials are received and tuition is paid in full.

English Language Requirements

Students indicating that English is not their primary language will be required to submit evidence of English proficiency. Below are the general guidelines for English Language proficiency within University College Programs; individual programs may specify modifications to these requirements in their program pages.

| Test or Course | Minimum Score Required for Consideration |
| --- | --- |
| **Internet-Based TOEFL**  \*Tufts does not accept TOEFL’s “My Best Scores” | 100 |
| **IELTS** | 6.5 or above |
| **PTE** | 68+ |
| **Duolingo English test** | 120 |
| **All-English High School or Middle School** | Unofficial transcript demonstrating 1+ years attended in good standing |

Cancellation of Full Course or Program

Tufts University reserves the right to cancel a course or program due to low enrollment or other circumstances beyond the university's control. Students will be notified by email (and phone, when possible) when a course or program is canceled. Cancellations will also be posted to the course directory, program pages, and website. Canceled courses and programs are eligible for refunds of tuition and any applicable registration fee if the canceled course was the only course in which a student was enrolled. Please see the Refund Policy for additional details.

* **Format changes**: Please note that the transition of a course from an in-person format to an online virtual campus format does not qualify as a course cancellation. On-campus courses that are transitioned to the online virtual campus will be adapted to offer the same quality, content and outcome as if they had been administered in person.
* **Timelines of Cancellation Decisions**:

  + Courses at Tufts (including Summer Sessions and Winter Session) makes reasonable efforts to determine course cancellation in advance of the first day of classes, but the final status of a course may not be resolved until the first day of classes.
  + Tufts Pre-College Programs makes reasonable effort to determine program cancellations by two weeks after the application deadline of the term in which the program will take place.
  + Tufts Campaign School makes reasonable effort to determine program cancellation by December 20 each year.
