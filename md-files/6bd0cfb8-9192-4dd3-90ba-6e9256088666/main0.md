#### About Rice Architecture Summer Immersion Program

The Rice Architecture Summer Immersion program, offered in collaboration with the Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM), is designed for Houston-based current (2025-2026 school year) 10th- and 11th-grade students interested in applying to architecture school. This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the principles of architecture and design. Students test design concepts through several media and exercises in two and three dimensions.

The goal is to explore architectural space at a range of scales and to produce creative works that participants can integrate into a design portfolio, a necessary component in the college application process for architecture programs. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with Rice University faculty and current students, as well as practicing architects, to learn more about the field of architecture.
