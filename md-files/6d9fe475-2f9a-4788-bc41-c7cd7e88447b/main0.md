## Welcome to Clemson University Summer Scholars!

Is your rising 7th to 12th grade child (up to the age of 17 at time of camp) exploring different college paths? Give them a sneak peek at what college life is all about, and different subjects they can explore, through a Summer Scholars course this summer!

Every summer, the Summer Scholars program at Clemson University welcomes hundreds of campers who enjoy a one-week introduction to a variety of university learning options, while being immersed in our campus culture.

[Sign Up for our Mailing List](https://share.hsforms.com/1iS20PxYnQLmINKhT5jGZjQsjl7s)

### Experience Clemson Classrooms

Students will engage in hands-on, immersive courses in their field of choice taught by Clemson instructors during the day. Classes may include laboratory tours, field trips, and exciting experiments and projects.

### A Taste of College

Afternoons include small-group time which can be spent exploring campus, attending a campus tour, or meeting a representative from Admissions or the Clemson University Honors College. Learning doesn’t just happen inside the classroom, but outside the classroom too.

### Have Fun

Evenings feature many recreational activities Clemson students enjoy such as a show at the planetarium, ice cream, games on Bowman field, and an end-of-camp celebration!

### Camp on Campus

Participants taking courses stay in a residence hall and eat meals in a dining hall throughout the week to complete their on-campus experience. Summer Scholars students will also meet current Clemson students, who serve as counselors to guide, mentor, and answer questions about life as a Tiger.

### International Connections

Partnerships with international education providers such as Gyeonggi Science High School in South Korea bring global perspectives to specific courses. When these students travel to the Clemson campus, they can both explore a college subject while participating in social and cultural events on and off campus with other Summer Scholars students.

**Clemson University Summer Scholars is accredited by the American Camp Association, the only nationwide organization that accredits all types of organized camps.**
