# Frequently Asked Questions

###

* [Who is eligible for camp?](#)

  Summer Scholars is for high school students who are rising 9th -12th grade. Students who turn 18 before or during a specific session are ineligible for camp. Course grade requirements are set by instructors based on material level and project design.
* [How do I apply?](#)

  To apply for camp, a camper, parent, or guardian must complete our online application, pay a $200 deposit, and email us an unofficial transcript with a weighted 3.3 GPA. Students who do not have a 3.3 GPA will also be asked to submit supplemental documentation for acceptance. To learn more about how to register and to access our registration website, visit our [How to Apply page](program/how-to-apply.html).
* [What if the course I want is full?](#)

  All courses have a waitlist available. If you would like to be added to a waitlist, please complete the registration process as normal and select "+waitlist" for your desired session and course. Once you reach the end of the registration form, you will be added to the waitlist. A deposit is not required to be added to the waitlist.

  If a spot becomes available, we will reach out to you. We are unable to determine when and if a spot will become available in advance.
* [What is the weather like in Clemson during the Summer?](#)

  Summers can be very hot in Clemson with average temperatures between 90-100 degrees. Students will walk to and from class and meals an engage in outdoor activities. Our team will monitor weather to adjust any plans based on heat advisories or rain. Students are encouraged to bring a reusable water bottle with them that can be filled up with ice in the dining hall and water in the dining hall, residence hall, and academic buildings.
* [When is arrival and departure?](#)

  Arrival is each Sunday from 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM (EST). Departure is each Friday from 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM (EST). If you need to arrange a different time for drop off or pick up, please contact our office directly prior to camp. We cannot always guarantee that we can accommodate different arrival and departure times as camp will close between sessions.
* [I am flying in for camp. Do you have an airport shuttle?](#)

  Yes! We do offer an airport shuttle for $100 each way. Our shuttle is only able to accommodate flights to and from Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP). Students who are flying in and using our shuttle service should plan to land between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Students who are flying out and using our shuttle service should plan to arrive back to the airport around 4:00 PM and should schedule flights accordingly. 

  If a departure flight were to be rescheduled or cancelled, our staff will bring students back to campus for the night and back to the airport for their new flight.
* [Will I leave campus for field trips?](#)

  Scholars may leave campus for a variety of activities. Some courses plan field trips to local establishments that reinforce what they are learning in class.  The expenses for the trips are included in the cost of the program and students will only need money for personal expenses.
* [What are the residence halls like?](#)

  Summer Scholars will be located in Douthit Hall East, Buildings E and G. [**Check it out!**](https://housing.clemson.edu/douthit-hills-east/) You can take a look at the room layout, building floor plans, images of the bathrooms and take a virtual tour of the neighborhood grounds. The residence halls are air-conditioned. Refrigerators are not provided in individual dorm rooms unless deemed medically necessary. Scholars access their room by using a key. Each hall and/or outer door is card access protected, which each counselor will have access to. Scholars are asked to lock their door when leaving the room and when sleeping. Clemson University and Summer Scholars do not assume responsibility for any items lost or stolen. Scholars and parents/guardians will be asked to read and sign the “Housing Release of Liability” form before arriving. Scholars will enjoy most meals on campus at the [**Fresh Food Company**](https://clemson.campusdish.com/LocationsAndMenus/McAlisterDiningHall)(Core Dining Hall). During field trips, students enjoy boxed lunches from the dining hall or catered meals off campus. Students are encouraged to eat three meals a day, as they will be kept very busy. All special requests that address dietary concerns should be noted on the student's application.
* [Where and what will I eat?](#)

  We will eat most of our meals at [**The Fresh Food Company**](https://clemson.campusdish.com/LocationsAndMenus/McAlisterDiningHall) in Core Campus. If a field trip takes us off site, we will provide box lunches from the dining hall. Our chefs and dietitians are here to help take the mystery out of healthy eating. We recognize and do our best to accommodate food allergies and special dietary needs in a way that’s personalized, sensitive and supportive. [**Look here**](https://clemson.campusdish.com/HealthAndWellness) for more information on Health and Wellness at Clemson University. In fact, we pride ourselves on working with you to make sure you can find the food that fits your life. For more information, email [**nutrition@clemson.edu**](mailto:nutrition@clemson.edu.).
* [How will you decide my residence hall assignment?](#)

  Residence hall groups are assigned according to sex and age.  Please list all roommate requests on your application, but please know roommates are not guaranteed.
* [What are the expectations of Scholars?](#)

  The Summer Scholars program is recommended for responsible middle and high school students that want to learn more about life in a college setting. While we recognize that this age student is not a college freshman, we do expect students to exhibit self-control and portray excellent character. The scholar and parent/guardian will be required to read and sign the “Code of Conduct” and the “Discipline” policy forms (which outline behavior standards) before arriving on campus.

  Scholars who continue to display problem behavior will be asked to withdraw from the program **without a refund.**

  No student will be allowed to leave the campus without the permission of their parent/guardian and the Director of Summer Scholars. Scholars may drive a car to campus but will not be allowed use of their personal vehicle until end-of-camp departure.
* [Who will be the camp counselors?](#)

  They are Clemson University students and some were Summer Scholars themselves! Counselors have been chosen for their dedication and their ability to work with youth. They are selected through a thorough interview process, background checks, and reference checks. They undergo extensive pre-camp training prior to the beginning of the summer. Summer Scholars strives to afford participants small group time with staff and fellow scholars. Counselors supervise scholars 24 hours a day, and live on-site. They accompany the scholars to class, on field trips, and to social events. Counselors are assigned residence hall groups during the evening and nighttime. They are responsible for ensuring that students are aware of and comply with the expectations set before them. The nighttime residence hall ratio of scholars to counselor staff is 10 to 1.
* [What should I bring and what should I leave at home?](#)

  Recommended items are listed below. Please pack light. You do not have to bring everything in your closet or room! We recommend that campers bring only one suitcase and one bedroll. If possible, mark clothes with your name, as we will not be responsible for lost clothing or other personal items. You should be prepared to carry or wheel your luggage, and should not bring more than you can carry. If you are flying to Greenville, be sure to check the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guidelines. Since most airlines are charging for extra bags, you will have to pack wisely!

* [Is it okay to bring my cell phone or other electronics?](#)

  Summer Scholars operates as an "unplugged camp," encouraging face-to-face interactions. A scholar may avoid getting to know their roommates or may rely on her parents too much by using these electronics.

  Scholars are permitted to use their cell phones during designated times only. If a camper needs to bring his or her cell phone to camp, we will ask that they refrain from using it during all organized program activities unless required in the course. They will be allowed to use it during unstructured free time for “checking in” with parents or emergencies. Electronic devices of any kind (other than cameras) may be used only during unstructured free time, rest periods, and/or before bed. They may not leave the dorm unless required in the course. Please leave any gaming consoles at home. Students will have access to Clemson University’s WIFI throughout the week. Please view program-specific packing list in case specific electronics are required for your child’s course.

  If there is an emergency, you can call us and we can connect you to your child very quickly. Please call 864-656-2314.
* [Should I bring additional spending money?](#)

  Many students enjoy purchasing Clemson University souvenirs, buying pizza together, etc. It is at your discretion on the exact amount to send with them, however, a good suggestion would be around $20-$30 (excluding souvenirs). Most on campus vendors do not accept cash at this time. Having access to a debit/credit card would be beneficial. They also accept Apple Pay. We apologize for the inconvenience. All meals are included in your tuition.
* [Should I bring snacks?](#)

  You are able to send nonperishable snacks for your scholars, however, they will solely be responsible for them and refrigeration is not guaranteed. Vending machines are available in the residence halls.
* [Is there health care available?](#)

  Staff certified in First Aid and CPR will be present at camp 24 hours each day. The on-campus Redfern Health Center is available during weekday business hours, with Urgent Care in Clemson available through late evening. A full-service hospital is available within a 15-minute drive of campus.

  All medications must be given to the health officer upon arrival at camp. The health officer will be responsible for properly administering the medicine on a daily basis as directed by a physician or parent.  **All prescription and non-prescription drugs** are kept under lock and key.  (Exceptions may be made for inhalers or Epi-pens.) The health officer will have commonly used non-prescription medications such as Ibuprofen and acetaminophen available. Please refrain from packing such medications if possible. All campers are screened upon arrival at camp for good health prior to admission. We ask that no camper come to camp ill or with any contagious condition.  We reserve the right to send your camper home if they become ill, develop any contagious condition (such as pink eye, or head lice) or if they are unable to participate in the major activities of camp. If your camper cannot remain at camp due to health reasons you **will NOT receive a refund** of camp fees. Each camp has limited medical insurance on every camper for accidents and illnesses that occur at camp. Pre-existing illness and eyeglass/contact replacement are not covered. Camp is not responsible for eyeglasses or contacts that are lost or broken at camp.
* [Can I send mail to my child?](#)

  Yes! Please feel free to write your child. Parents often mail letters and packages the week prior to check-in, so mail will reach the camp before they leave that week.

  Please note that mail sent to campus can sometimes take a day or two after the marked delivery date to reach our office's mailbox.

  The mailing address is:
