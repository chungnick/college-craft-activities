# EngineerGirl Writing Contest

Every year, EngineerGirl hosts a contest dealing with engineering and its impact on our world. The topic and detailed instructions for the contest are posted in September with a deadline for submissions on February 1st of the following year. Winners are announced in the summer.

The 2026 Writing Contest, co-hosted by our sibling platform [EngineerTeen](https://engineerteen.org/), asks students to use art and writing to express how engineers create a better world.
