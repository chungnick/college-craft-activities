Contest - EngineerTeen

### Introducing EngineerTeen!

EngineerTeen is the next step in over 25 years of work and study by engineers and scholars. Working with the National Academy of Engineering, expert volunteers have worked hard to provide reliable information, advice, and support to aspiring young engineers via EngineerGirl. EngineerTeen will build on that inclusive community to provide a network of support for the youth who will be the technical leaders of tomorrow. The site is still in the beta phase, and we are making updates regularly. If you have feedback or ideas for how we can make it better, [please message us](mailto:engineerteen@nae.edu)!

## Engineering & Art: Writing & Design Competition

### We would like you to use art to express how engineers create a better world!

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, because images often tell an entire story. Visual thinking is an important part of engineering design, so this year we are trying something new with the EngineerGirl Writing Contest. **We would like you to use art to express how engineers create a better world!** Submissions should also include a written artist’s statement that explains how the artwork demonstrates that contribution. In addition to the showcase of winners, where possible, winning submissions (or portions of the winning submissions) from this competition will be featured in the background of the EngineerGirl website!
