## What is an EngineerGirl Ambassador?

An EngineerGirl Ambassador is a female, U.S. high school student who designs, develops, and implements a project in her local community that will encourage younger girls - particularly those with little access to engineering role models - to think about engineering and engineering careers and give them practical experience in engineering design.

Ambassadors will receive training and support from the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) through the EngineerGirl website.

## Why be an EngineerGirl Ambassador?

“There is no better feeling than lighting a spark in someone and sharing your passion with others.”

~ Sophie Poole, 2019-2020 Ambassador

An EngineerGirl Ambassadorship is a unique year-long opportunity to build leadership skills, meet new people, make a difference in your community, and help promote engineering along the way.  Each Ambassador receives:

* An all-expenses-paid trip to the EngineerGirl Ambassador training and networking event.  *Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19, the event may be held in Washington, DC at the National Academies facilities or separated into multiple virtual meetings online.*
* Project funding of up to $250.
* Leadership development and membership in a community of like-minded young women from around the country.
* A certificate and letter of recognition from the National Academy of Engineering.
* An EngineerGirl t-shirt and other gifts as they are available

#### The Ambassadors Program is made possible by a generous grant from Mr. John F. McDonnell and support from the A. James and Alice B. Clark Foundation.
