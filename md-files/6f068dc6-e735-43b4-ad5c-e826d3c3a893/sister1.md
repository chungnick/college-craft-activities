### Frequently Asked Questions

Check out our most frequently asked questions about about Shoreline's Continuing Education
Camps.

### How large is each camp?

Class size for all groups is limited depending on the session and camp. Register early
because some camps and classes fill early. Athletics camps cap at 50 whereas some
computer and art camps have maximum class sizes of 6 or 12 students.

### When should I be there?

An adult will be present 15 minutes before each class starts and 15 minutes after
the class ends. For your child’s safety, please let us know of any relatives who might
be picking up your child after the class ends. That way we can ensure your child always
leaves with the right person. There will be a section for this information on our
Emergency Contact Form.

### How do I register?

Click the button above and you will be directed to the Continuing Education Course
Catalog and online registration page where you can pay with a credit card.

Call the Continuing Education office and we can help register your student over the
phone and discuss your payment options. If you come to campus, you will be directed
to the Shoreline Community College Cashiers in the #5000 Building, main floor, to
pay with a credit card or check to complete the transaction.

**If you are registering a new student, use their name and birth date to set up the
profile. You will be able to provide your name in a different screen.**

**Note: You will be sent parent consent/waiver paperwork to the email address you provide
during registration. Do not use a student email unless you have access to it.** Important information will be sent to that email address before the camp. **Please check this email account and search your spam folder if you have not heard
from us 1-2 weeks before the camp date. Camp parent waiver forms are posted below and will be sent 1 month before the camp
date.**

### How do I register multiple students?

Each student should be entered individually with their own online profile. Make sure
to exit back to the home registration menu before registering a second student. Let
us know if you need assistance and we can register your student(s) over the phone.

### What is Shoreline's mask policy?

Masks will be voluntary on Shoreline's campus, both indoors and outdoors. Please keep
your student home if they are feeling unwell and contact the camp instructor.
