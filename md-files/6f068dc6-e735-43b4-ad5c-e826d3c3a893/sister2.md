# Funding & Aid Sources

Get help with tuition, fees, books, transportation, and food.

Shoreline Community College can help you apply for aid and access a full range of
financial assistance programs. Eligibility for each program can vary widely, so it
is important to understand the requirements for the particular types of aid you may
be seeking.

### Financial Aid

Money for school including grants, loans, work-study (part-time paid work), or state
aid.  
  
**Eligibility:** Determined through the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) or the WASFA
(state aid application).  
  
**Timeline:** Apply early! Priority for some grants is given to students who complete their financial
aid application process by the early application deadline

[Learn more about financial aid and apply](/apply-and-aid/funding-and-aid/financial-aid/default.aspx)

### Professional/Technical - Workforce Funding

If you're enrolling in a [professional/technical program](/programs/prof-tech-programs.aspx) (not university transfer degree), you may be eligible for **financial, food, transportation**, and other additional aid.  
  
**Eligibility:** Meet one of the following:

- laid off, furloughed, or eligible for unemployment benefits

- received unemployment insurance in past four years

- receive TANF (cash assistance) or food stamps through DSHS

- low-income (both individual and household)

- became a veteran in the past four years

[Learn more about Workforce Funding](/workforce/default.aspx)

### Scholarships

Scholarships are awarded funds that you do not have to pay back. As a Shoreline Community
College student, you have many scholarships available to you through the Foundation.  
  
**Eligibility:** There are both need-based and merit-based scholarships.  
  
**Timeline:** Applications are accepted in January-March for scholarship funds that will go out
the following academic year (eg. our January-March 2025 applications are for scholarship
funds disbursed in Summer 2025-Spring 2026).

[Explore Scholarships](/foundation/scholarships.aspx)

### Payment Plans

Split your tuition payment into smaller monthly amounts with 0% interest for a $30
enrollment fee.  
  
**Eligibility:** Available to all students, regardless of eligibility for other financial resources.   
  
**Timeline:** Check the quarterly target dates for information or to enroll in a payment plan

[Learn more about payment plans](/apply-and-aid/cashiering/payment-plan.aspx)

### Veterans & Military Service Funding

As a veteran, a current active duty member, or a dependent of the military, you may
be entitled to VA benefits, tuition reductions, or tuition assistance programs while
enrolled at Shoreline Community College.

[Learn more about funding for veterans & military service members](/oss/veterans/default.aspx)

### Tuition Waivers

A tuition waiver or discount is another way to counter the costs of college. Online
students, state employees, and senior citizens may qualify for reduced tuition.
