## WHAT IS SIBLINGHOOD ACADEMY?

**Siblinghood Academy** is an afterschool program where young people are encouraged to explore their leadership skills and abilities through SNLP style classes.

* **Participate in field trips and conferences** to explore their community and strengthen their confidence, communication, and other leadership skill

**What Do Nashers Say About It?**

### “It was the first time I felt like I mattered, that I had a voice, and that I could have an impact. When I started at Sadie Nash, I had zero sisters. But I came out with 65 sisters who had my back and I had theirs.” — Nasher, Siblinghood Academy
