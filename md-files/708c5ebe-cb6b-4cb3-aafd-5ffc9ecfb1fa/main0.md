# Engineering Camp

Explore engineering and kick-start your college experience by experimenting in real research labs with Bucknell's world-class faculty. **Engineering Camp** is an academically challenging, hands-on introduction to engineering held on Bucknell's campus during the summer.

You'll discover the many different areas where engineers apply their skills, study the latest technologies that shape our world and learn how the scientific phenomena you've studied in school are applied to solve engineering problems.
