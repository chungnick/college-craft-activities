## Itinerary

**Arrival**

Plan to arrive on campus on Sunday, June 21, at 3 p.m.

Registration will be located at the entrance to McDonnell Hall. (Any change in location or time will be communicated via email.) At registration, you will be given a camper packet including group schedule, room key (for your dorm room) and swipe card (for meals and entering buildings). You will have about half an hour to get moved into your dorm room. Camp counselors will be there to help you.

At 3:30 p.m., we will gather all students and their families to meet the staff and answer any questions that you may have.

At 4 p.m., it will be time for your family to leave, and you will have your first activities with the counselors and other campers.

Instructional sessions begin Monday morning.

**Camp**

For a breakdown of the daily camp schedule, visit the [Engineering Camp](https://www.bucknell.edu/admissions-aid/plan-visit/camps-conferences-visit-programs/engineering-camp) webpage.

**Departure**

On Friday, June 26, you will receive specific checkout instructions during the morning meeting.

At noon it will be time to say goodbye to the staff and your fellow campers. Before departing, you will complete a survey, return your room key and swipe card, sign out and check that you have not forgotten anything.

Departures will take place from McDonnell Hall, in the same location as check-in.

## Important Information

**Getting to Bucknell**

You'll find Bucknell University in Lewisburg, a historic community in the heart of central Pennsylvania. Whether you're arriving by plane or bus, on four wheels or two, you'll find directions to our campus [here](https://www.bucknell.edu/admissions-aid/plan-visit/maps-directions).

We have chaperoned camp shuttles that will have pick-up and drop-off locations at Harrisburg (MDT) Airport, Baltimore (BWI) Airport, Newark (EWR) Airport and William Penn High School in New Castle, Del. If you are interested in using one of these shuttle services, please indicate so on your registration form and you will be contacted. Campers departing campus via shuttle will be provided a bagged lunch.

**Tuition & Payment**

The 2025 program cost for a residential camper is $1,500. If you are a commuter camper (no housing or breakfast), or you cannot attend all days of camp, please contact [engineering.camp@bucknell.edu](mailto:engineering.camp@bucknell.edu). Fees include tuition, laboratory and classroom supplies, housing, all meals, a t-shirt and a camp bag. You may make payment on the website sent to you via email. Checks payable to Bucknell University will be accepted for tuition.

The registration form sent to you via email should be completed to secure your spot in the camp. Because we typically have a waitlist, any spot not claimed by May 1 may be forfeited. All tuition should be paid before May 1. Please do not send correspondence through the mail after May 1. Any tuition remaining unpaid after May 1 must be paid by check (preferred) or cash in person at the time of registration.

**Will financial aid be available?**

Need-based financial assistance is available for those who qualify. If you would like to be considered for financial aid, please complete the [Financial Aid Application](https://forms.gle/1UyjvakWbJdnWAbw6). Your assessed tuition information will then be emailed separately at a later date.

**Dining at Bucknell**

[Bostwick Social House](https://dineoncampus.com/Bucknell/bostwick-social-house) provides a variety of meal options and caters to individual [dietary needs](https://dineoncampus.com/Bucknell/allergy-management).

**What are the dorms like?**

[McDonnell Hall](https://www.bucknell.edu/life-bucknell/housing-services/campus-living-options/first-year-housing/mcdonnell-hall) is a typical first-year dormitory: fully air-conditioned, two beds in each room and shared bathrooms. Campers will have a roommate.

**Who will be my roommate?**

Roommates will be assigned based on gender and age. If you know someone also attending camp whom you would like to have as your roommate, please indicate that on your acceptance form.

**What to Bring:**

* Flip-flops for the shower, shower caddy, soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, deodorant and other toiletries.
* Towels (for showers and pool) and washcloths; a bathrobe is recommended.
* Linens for extra-long twin bed.
  + A sheet set (flat, fitted, and pillowcase plus two body towels, one hand towel and one washcloth) or deluxe sheet set (sheet set plus pillow and blanket) can be rented by indicating your preference on the acceptance form.
* Pillow, comforter, blanket or sleeping bag, if desired.
* Water bottle and travel mug (if you are a coffee or tea drinker).
* Umbrella
* Swimsuit
* Athletic attire for afternoon activities.
  + If you have a favorite sport ball (soccer, football, etc.) feel free to bring it!
* Proper shoes for certain laboratory activities (heels and toes must be covered).
* Snacks (non-perishable) and drinks
  + The cafeteria is all-you-care-to-enjoy, but you may like to have snacks in the evening.
* Pack of cards, small board games, etc.
