“

I am so grateful I decided to come to Bucknell — mainly because of the community I found through the Gamgort Family Gateway Scholars Program. The support, encouragement and resources completely changed my perspective. Because of the scholarship, I can pursue the major — and eventually the career — that I have dreamed of doing since I was a child.
