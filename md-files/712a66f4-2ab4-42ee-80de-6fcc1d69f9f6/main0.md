## What’s SSP All About?

The JAX Summer Student Program (SSP) is designed for intellectually curious undergraduate and graduating high school seniors eager to explore how genetics and genomics shape biological systems — and who want to grow as independent researchers in a collaborative environment. The program emphasizes laboratory discovery, scientific communication and personal growth in a team environment.

#### Mentored Research, Meaningful Impact

With guidance from experienced [scientific mentors](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty), you will join ongoing research programs to implement a project related to the work of the lab, gaining increasing independence as the fellowship progresses. At the end of the summer, you will present your work to JAX researchers, other SSP participants and family members.

#### Learn the Work of Professional Scientists

Throughout the 10 weeks, you'll build essential skills through training and professional development sessions covering topics like genetic testing, data visualization, science communication and peer review. Weekly Journal Club meetings and informal conversations with JAX scientists and professionals — including grant writers, scientific services experts, attorneys, veterinarians, and external relations specialists — offer a deeper look into the many career paths shaped by science

#### One Program, Two Campuses

The Summer Student Program is available at The Jackson Laboratory in [Bar Harbor, Maine](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/learn-earn-and-explore/bar-harbor) and The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in [Farmington, Connecticut](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/learn-earn-and-explore/farmington). Outside the laboratory, there is much to explore. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with each location's surrounding activities and amenities by reviewing the campus pages.

#### Join a Supportive Scientific Community

The Summer Student Program brings together students from all over the United States with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. The SSP living-learning community encourages students to imagine their role in a future research career. Their scientific growth is fostered through conversations and collaborations with JAX faculty, trainees and staff. Students also engage in co-curricular training in scientific communication, professional development and the responsible conduct of research.
