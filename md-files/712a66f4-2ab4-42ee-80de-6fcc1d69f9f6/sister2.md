### Admission

Admission to the Summer Student Program (SSP) is competitive, and students of all backgrounds are selected. All students receive a stipend of **$7,000**for the 10-week program, including room and board. The cost of round-trip travel between the student's home and the Laboratory is also provided.

Students are required to attend the entire program. Students with date conflicts are still encouraged to apply; JAX staff will assist admitted students in negotiating early release, early finals, etc., to facilitate their on-time participation in required trainings at the beginning of the program. Students with significant date conflicts— such as early departure for overseas study — are encouraged to delay their application for another year. Students must not hold another job or internship or take summer classes during the program.

SSP is a 40-hour per week commitment that includes completing lab work and activities required by your host lab, attending weekly professional development sessions, and participating in a weekly journal club.

### Eligibility and Selection

JAX Genomic Education staff review each individual application. Considering only the materials submitted within the context of the application (supplemental materials are not permitted), the Summer Student Program will offer fellowships to students whose applications best match our review criteria and programmatic goals. For example, we look for evidence of the following characteristics:

* an indication of a deep desire to conduct an independent, mentored-research project in the broad area of genetics and genomics;
* academic achievement;
* curiosity and passion for science;
* resilience and problem-solving;
* personal maturity and acceptance of responsibility; and
* aptitude for working independently and within a team.
