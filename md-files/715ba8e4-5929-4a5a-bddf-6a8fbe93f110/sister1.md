During the summer months MaineHealth Institute for Research (MHIR) provides undergraduates with an opportunity to engage in full-time, biomedical research projects through the MHIR Summer Undergraduate Research Program.

Research at MHIR covers the spectrum of biomedical science in our various Research Centers: **[Center for Molecular Medicine](https://mhir.org/?page_id=108)**, **[Center for Clinical and Translational Science](https://mhir.org/?page_id=38800)**, **[Center for Interdisciplinary Population & Heath Research](https://mhir.org/?page_id=18577)**, and the **[Center for Applied Science & Technology](https://mhir.org/?page_id=39135)**.

The Summer Undergraduate Research Program is ten weeks in duration, and students work 40 hours per week at one of our MaineHealth research locations in the Portland, ME area. Students are trained to lead research projects and are provided with a rich curriculum that covers a breadth of research topics, professional competencies, and biomedical and science training and careers. Students are responsible for their own transportation and housing, and resources will be provided to help students find housing options.

We welcome you to review the information provided here about the 2026 Summer Undergraduate Research Program, including eligibility and program dates, as well as previous student projects.

#### MaineHealth Summer Research Internship Program’s 2026 application is live. The application has a two part application process. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.

1. Go online and complete the **[MaineHealth Employment Application](https://www.careersatmainehealth.org/jobs/17091847-research-intern-mainehealth-research-institute)**
2. Complete the supplemental [**MaineHealth Summer Undergraduate Research Internship Program Application**](https://redcap.mhir.cloud/surveys/?s=XHCLDHNFYNXP49HL)

Although you may complete your application in more than one sitting, it may help you to gather the following in preparation for the application:

* **Resume**
* **Transcript** (unofficial/screenshot is ok)
* **Grades** in your most recent five science classes
* **Personal Statement** (500 words or less): The personal statement should include an overview of your qualifications for participation in the program. If applicable, please include specific experiences in biomedical science, previous summer internships or academic programs, involvement with hands-on laboratory experience, and general research interests, including any strong preferences for, or against, working in a specific research area.
* **Short Answer questions** (all limited to 250 words):
  + Please list any skills or experiences you would particularly like to gain during an internship at MHIR.
  + Please list any skills/relevant experience you currently have that might be useful for your internship (lab techniques, software/programming experience, etc).
  + Please describe how your individual identities, experiences and perspectives have helped you become the student, friend or community member you are today.
  + Describe an obstacle or challenge you have faced, and how you overcame it.
  + Describe a success, either academic, professional, or personal, that you are proud of.

Only applicants who complete both parts of the application will be considered. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed. You will receive confirmation of application completion by email.

The MaineHealth Employment application asks for information about your past employment and education history- you may upload a resume and it will pre-populate much of that application for you. The MaineHealth Employment application will ask you to provide the names and contact information for two references. Your references may be contacted via email or phone, but formal recommendation letters are not required to be submitted as part of the MaineHealth or MHIR applications.

The application deadline for the Summer Undergraduate Research Program is **January 30, 2026**. Selection begins in February, and all students will be notified no later than **April 1, 2026**. Students being considered for positions may be contacted for interviews which may be conducted via telephone or virtually.

MHIR is a host site for the [American Heart Association (AHA) SURE Program](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/sure-scholars "https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/sure-scholars")which provides funding and other benefits to support undergraduates working on projects aligned with the AHA mission. Students who are selected for the MHIR SURP may be eligible to apply as an AHA SURE scholar.
