# Summer Mathematics Institute

**For Bright and Gifted Pre-College Students**  
The Summer Mathematics Institute is a free opportunity for bright and gifted pre-college students to interact with university faculty and each other, to take some challenging math classes that earn college credit, and have fun in an academic atmosphere. The Institute runs approximately from late June through the first week of August each summer. Students are encouraged to apply early (before the deadline of mid-May). If you are interested in applying, you may request an application by sending an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b5d0d6ddd0dbd2f5dad4ded9d4dbd19bd0d1c0).

For his graduate studies, he earned his M.Math. in 1990 and Ph.D. in Combinatorics and Optimization from the University of Waterloo (Canada) in 1995. From 1995 to 1997, he was a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Postdoctoral Fellow and part-time lecturer in the George R. Brown School of Engineering at Rice University. He was  a member of the examination committee of the Michigan Mathematics Prize Competition (MMPC) from 2001 to 2005, from 2008 to 2012 and from 2013-2017. He also served as the Director of MMPC from 2005 to 2008. MMPC is a state-wide competition given every year to thousands of high school students in Michigan.  
  
He is co-Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Computer Mathematics: Computer Systems Theory (Taylor & Francis) and Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Interconnection Networks (World Scientific), as well as a member of a number of the editorial boards of journals including Networks (Wiley), Discrete Applied Mathematics (Elsevier) and International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics (Springer).  
  
His research interests include combinatorial optimization, integer programming and network analysis. He has authored and coauthored about 200 research papers. Professor Cheng has directed a number of high school students for projects that advanced to semifinals and beyond in national competitions such as Siemens Competitions and the Intel Science Talent Search. Many of these projects resulted in publications in refereed journals. He is the recipient of the 2007 Mathematical Association of America (Michigan Section) Distinguished Teaching Award and a recipient of the 2009 Professor of the Year Award from the Presidents Council, State Universities of Michigan.

The Institute Past Directors

**Dr. Marc Lipman** served as the director from 1997 to 2002. During this time he was Professor and Chair of the  [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](/math/) at Oakland University. He graduated from Lake Forest College in 1971 with a double major in Mathematics and Physics. He earned his Ph.D. from Dartmouth College in 1976. From 1976 to 1989, he was a faculty member at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. During this time, he spent 1980–1981 at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.. From 1989 to 1997, he was the scientific officer in charge of the four million dollar Discrete Mathematics program at the Office of Naval Research. His research interests include interconnection networks, communication network topology and sphere-of-influence graphs. He has authored and coauthored over 50 research papers. Among other things, he's taught at STAR, the residential summer camp for bright and gifted students at Purdue University. He left Oakland University to be the Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at IUPU Fort Wayne.  **Dr. James H. McKay** was the first director (1996–1997) of the institute. Dr. McKay was the first professor in the department in 1959 and served as the chair of the department for many years through the 1990's. He retired in 1997.

Schedule

The 2025 Summer Mathematics Institute at Oakland University meets for six weeks.  
  
Activities are scheduled Monday through Thursday from 8:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. and Friday from 8:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. Students will attend special sections of two regular Oakland University courses that generate regular university credit. Generally, each class will meet every day. When not in class, the students will be in small groups under the direct supervision of counselors. Small group sessions will include opportunities to do homework, problem solving, computer instruction and practice, and other mathematical recreations.  
  
Lunch will be provided (FREE) every day.  
  
The Summer Mathematics Institute at Oakland University closes with a banquet. Parents, students' high-school mathematics teachers, and their high-school principals will be invited. The program will include the presentation of Certificates of Completion to the students. We will also provide signed testimony regarding the college credit courses taken during the Institute.
