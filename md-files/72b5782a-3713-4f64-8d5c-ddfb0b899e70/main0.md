## Innovate: The Raikes School Way

### The Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management hosts an annual summer camp for high school students interested in computing.

**Innovate: The Raikes School Way** is designed to provide students with a foundation in core programming concepts, and is ideal for students with little to no computing experience. Additionally, there is separate curriculum and instruction for students with moderate or advanced experience as they aim to expand their computing skills. Students who expect to enter college in the fall of 2027 will be given priority based on total applications. Students who expect to enter college in the fall of 2028 will also be considered if they have completed pre-calculus prior to the start of camp.   
  
**Tentative Camp Dates:** July 19-August 1, 2026  
  
*Cost covers all housing, meals, instruction, and activities associated with the camp.*  
Full and partial scholarships are available to students that submit a camp application.  
  
**Final Application Deadline:** May 1 *(applications received after May 1 will be considered on a space-available basis)*

The camp application consists of:  
-A short essay on why you wish to attend the camp  
-Level of coding experience, if any  
-Academic information (highest level of math completed, GPA, ACT/SAT scores if completed)  
-Unofficial high school transcript  
-Optional scholarship application

#### Stay in the Heart of Campus

During the two-week camp, you'll stay in the Kauffman Academic Residential Center, giving you an opportunity to live and learn in the same location as Raikes School students.

#### **Dive into Core Programming Concepts**

Through project-oriented curriculum, you'll learn fundamental innovation concepts and programming skills with a primary focus on widely utilized languages like Java and Python.

#### **Connect with Your Peers**

Through collaboration in class, evening games and activities, and trips to the dining hall for meals with your fellow students and Raikes School teaching assistants, you'll gain new friends and mentors.

#### **Explore the City and Nebraska’s Campus**

With activities like rock climbing, sand volleyball, bowling, and ice cream, you'll get a feel for all that Lincoln and Nebraska's campus have to offer.

#### **Visit Research Labs & Local Businesses**

You'll visit Nebraska’s NIMBUS drone lab, employer partners like Hudl, Nelnet, Don't Panic Labs, and others to learn about applications of business and computing, and professional opportunities in Lincoln.
