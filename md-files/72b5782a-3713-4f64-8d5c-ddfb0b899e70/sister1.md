## Tips for Success

The best thing you can do when applying for admittance to the Raikes School is to be yourself! Some things that we have observed that help students succeed in the Raikes School include:

* Take at least one year of calculus from your high school, a university, or a community college so you will be well prepared for advanced mathematics when you start at Nebraska.
* Take an object-oriented programming class, or engage in self-study, so you can find out if you enjoy computer programming.
* Take business courses from your high school, a university, or a community college. Understanding of basic business concepts covered by accounting and economics courses will help you determine your interest in business.
* Pursue a challenging senior year by taking advanced or honors classes, including Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or courses from a community college. Challenging courses show your commitment to academics and prepare you for the rigor of the Raikes School and college in general.
* Seek leadership roles in student organizations to learn more about your own strengths for leading. The Raikes School looks for students who understand the value of building leadership skills.
* Look for opportunities, like employment, clubs, or school organizations, that will enhance your technical and/or business skills to put your skills to test in a real-world environment. The Raikes School looks for demonstrated experience in and passion for computer science and/or business.
