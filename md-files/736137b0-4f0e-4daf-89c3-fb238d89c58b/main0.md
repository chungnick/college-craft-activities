# Architecture

### **An intensive program that engages inquisitive high school students in the creative energy and speculative culture of the study of architecture.**

## Program Overview

Pre-College Architecture responds to challenges regarding practice, communication, and our relationship with the built environment by utilizing a diverse set of tools and techniques, guided by the leadership of Carnegie Mellon Architecture Faculty.    
   
 Pre-College Architecture introduces design practice, creative problem solving, and critical thinking to young designers through a matrix of programming, celebrating curiosity, and providing a strong foundation for architectural education. Pre-College students will navigate complex design problems, encouraging growth through the development of skills and preparing them for future undergraduate studies.

## Curriculum

Pre-College Architecture is an intensive summer experience for students with a keen interest in architecture.  
    
 Over the course of five weeks, Pre-College students will experience the interdisciplinary field of architecture through the lens of [Carnegie Mellon Architecture](https://soa.cmu.edu/) as well as contemporary practices. Students will experience the dynamic of architectural education within the studio, supported by integrated coursework in analog drawing, digital media, seminars, and workshops. This approach will allow for broader exploration of design issues related to the environment, technology as well as the future of our cities.

The projects and assignments issued within all courses will increase in complexity as students build upon their newly found technical skills and creativity. Pre-College students will begin by working through a series of projects to build a basic comprehension of the fundamental principles of architecture. Students iterate ideas through 2D, 3D, digital, and analog techniques, participating in critique as a central component of the studio experience, with a focus on:

• Building foundational architectural skills, literacy, and confidence  
• Analytical thinking  
• Conceptual development  
• Techniques in representation and spatial articulation  

Pre-College students will be expected to both collaborate with their classmates as well as work individually. Seminars, special lectures, and field trips that relate to digital media and fabrication, issues of contemporary practice, and portfolio allow for additional exploration of the architecture profession.

## Typical Schedule

**Monday - Thursday:**  
9:00 am - 12:30 pm: Design, Media, History/Theory Seminars  
1:30 pm - 4:30 pm: Architectural Design Studio  
6:00 pm - 10:00 pm: Teaching Assistant help sessions and Open Studio

**Friday:**Field Trips  
**Weekends:**Open Studio

## Testimonials

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the Pre-College Architecture program challenging?**

Pre-College Architecture is an immersive program with the intensive energy and dynamic creative culture of a college-level experience. Design success is largely the result of focused effort and intensity of investigation; students should expect to invest significant time working in the studio with fellow students outside of class (evenings and weekends) to develop and complete project coursework.

**What is unique about the study of architecture?**

A progressive interdisciplinary course of study combining design creativity, historical perspective, technical knowledge and innovation, and social responsibility, architecture is a profession that occupies a unique role in the shaping of our built environment. Pre-College Architecture is structured to introduce the discipline of architecture and the study of architecture in a university setting.

**What is Design Studio?**

Studio is the core of the Pre-College Architecture Program and serves as an introduction to the spatial concepts of architecture. Projects will explore the design and experience of spatial environments through a series of creative investigations consisting of both independent and collaborative work. Studio work focuses on experience and human sensory engagement in physical space; project themes include context, scale, perception, light, materiality, and component systems. Studio work will be supported by individual critique as well as group discussion based upon critical review of student work. The course is focused entirely on project design work while integrating concepts and skills from Drawing and Digital Media as well as workshops and seminar courses.

**What skills and techniques will I learn in Digital Media?**

Digital Media introduces students to the creative use of digital software and technology in architecture through in-class workshops and lectures. Students will learn the basic skills needed to create, explore and critique digital images, drawings, and three-dimensional environments. As a complement to the design studio, assignments will encourage an active dialogue between design intentions and representational tools. With a focus on Photoshop, Illustrator, and Rhinoceros, skills explored include image editing, color manipulation, line drawings, curves, surfaces and solids, 3D object manipulation, and composite imagery. We provide an intensive introduction to creative software. No previous experience or specific computer skills are required to succeed, although dedication and commitment to the subject is critical for success.

**Are there activities specific to Pre-College Architecture outside of class time?**

On Fridays, field trips and special projects introduce students to dynamic learning opportunities out in the field. Trips and projects vary from year to year. Past events have included visits to recently completed local architectural projects, building construction sites, museum exhibitions, and workshop experiments in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon Architecture Computational Design and Digital Fabrication Labs. Some evenings and weekends, our teaching assistants hold optional workshops to provide extra help and support for classwork.

**Will I earn college credit from this program?**

No, Pre-College Architecture students do not earn college credit.

**Is there an opportunity for portfolio development?**

Work created in Pre-College Architecture may be excellent material to package for your portfolio.

**What supplies will I receive as part of the program?**

As part of the program costs, you will be provided materials and tools required for media and design studio. If you need additional supplies, feel free to purchase them from our Art Store once you arrive on campus.
