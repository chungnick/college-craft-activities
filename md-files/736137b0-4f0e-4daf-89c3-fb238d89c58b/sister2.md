### Pre-College 2026 International Application

For the purposes of Carnegie Mellon's Pre-College Programs application and enrollment process, **an international student is defined as a student who does not have U.S. citizenship or a current valid U.S. Permanent Residence Card (Green Card).**

We welcome international students to participate in our Pre-college programs. **For our international applicants, please make note of our I-20 Certificate of Eligibility and English proficiency requirements.**

Most of our Pre-College programs are open to international students, excluding those that have no cost to the participant (AI Scholars, CS Scholars, Summer Academy for Math and Science, and all scholarship consideration). **Carnegie Mellon, however, only issues I-20s for F-1 student status to students admitted to the Pre-College [Summer Session](../academic-programs/summer-session.html) residential program.** In-person, full-time study of at least 18 units is required.

Students interested in our other Pre-College programs may be able to participate if they are already in the U.S. in another immigration status or are attending high school in the U.S. in F-1 status. The [U.S. State Department restricts study](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) for visitors using the Visa Waiver Program or [B-1/B-2 visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html). Any visitor considering traveling to the U.S. in one of those statuses should review the U.S. government’s guidance and carefully consider their plans.

**Please Note:** **Admission to Carnegie Mellon’s Pre-College Programs does not guarantee that Carnegie Mellon will be able to issue a visa document to the admitted student or that the student will be able to obtain a visa and/or enter the U.S. to pursue the program**. Students who are unable to arrive in the U.S. may not attend the program remotely. A full refund (excluding the application fee) will be provided to international students who document that they were unable to obtain a visa to travel to the U.S.

For questions related to I-20 documentation, please reach out to [Judy van Rheenen](mailto:jvanrhee@andrew.cmu.edu) in the Office of International Education.

For questions related to the Pre-College Programs application and the English proficiency requirements, please reach out to the [Office of Pre-College Programs](mailto:precollege@andrew.cmu.edu).

## Important to know...

## The I-20 Certificate of Eligibility

International students coming to Carnegie Mellon to enroll in credit-bearing classes who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents (holding a current valid Permanent Resident Card/Green Card) may need to obtain an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility from the Office of International Education (OIE).

* If you are already in the U.S. on F-1 status and will be returning to your current school next fall, you would **not** need an I-20 from Carnegie Mellon.
* If you are already in the U.S. or will be coming to the U.S. as a dependent of a parent who is working in the U.S., you would **not** need an I-20 from Carnegie Mellon.
* If you will be coming to the U.S. from overseas to partipicate in the Pre-College [Summer Session](../academic-programs/summer-session.html) residential program and will either return to your overseas high school or attend a high school in the U.S. in the fall, you **will need** an I-20 and must complete the necessary paperwork to obtain that I-20.

If you are an international student **who will need an I-20**or**F-1 student visa** from Carnegie Mellon, you must apply and submit all supporting documents by **April 1**.

Please Note: Students who are admitted to a Pre-College program *other* than Summer Session are not eligible to receive I-20 Certificates of Eligibility.

If you are admitted to Pre-College Programs, the Office of International Education will send you the paperwork (an International Student Information Form and an Affidavit of Support Form) that you must complete to obtain an I-20. The Form I-20 is used to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Students who receive an I-20 from Carnegie Mellon must arrive on the Friday before Opening Day and complete a mandatory immigration check-in within the first week of programming in order to maintain legal status in the U.S. Admitted students will be sent more detailed instructions regarding this mandatory check-in.

## English Proficiency Requirements

If your native language is not English, we require a TOEFL score of 102 or better on the iBT (internet-based test) or iBT Home Edition, a TOEFL Essentials overall band score of at least 11, an IELTS score of 7.5 or above, a Duolingo English Test (DET) overall score of 135 or above, or a Cambridge English Assessment overall score of 191. Please arrange to have these scores uploaded with your application materials. Scores should be no more than two years old at the time of application. Your official TOEFL, IELTS, DET, or Cambridge scores reports are required.

If you are an international student who has attended a high school within the United States for a minimum of one year and plan to return to that high school after participation in our Pre-College Programs, you are exempt from the English proficiency test score requirement. Your unofficial transcripts must clearly show your attendance at a high school in the United States for the one-year minimum.

## Online Application and Program Choice

Within the online application, you will be asked to submit a combination of biographical, parent/guardian, and academic information. In addition, you will select up to two programs for application consideration in order of preference. Although second choice programs are not required, they are recommended. Please note that Summer Session is the only Pre-College program where admitted students are eligible to receive I-20 Certificates of Eligibility issued through Carnegie Mellon's Office of International Education.

Keep in mind that the order of your program preferences matter in our review process. Your first choice program preference should be labeled as such. All students will be initially considered for their first choice program preference. Applicants will only be admitted to one program.

Additionally, your application will not be considered complete until we receive your Letter(s) of Recommendation. We cannot review your application until these letter(s) have been received by our office. **Please plan ahead and request your recommendation letter(s) through our online application process in time for us to receive them by the application deadline.**

## Application Materials

**LETTER(S) OF RECOMMENDATION**

Your application will not be considered complete until we receive your Letter(s) of Recommendation. We cannot review your application until these letter(s) have been received by our office.

Once this is entered, an email will be automatically sent to the recommender. They will be directed to an online portal where they will complete the recommendation form and submit their letter of recommendation.

In general, recommendation letters should be submitted by a counselor or teacher who can speak to your readiness to attend a pre-college program that includes college-level work, independent living, and cooperation in group situations.

**It is important that you plan ahead and request your recommendation letter(s) through our online application process in time for us to receive them by the application deadline.**

Standardized tests scores are NOT required for application. However, you are welcome to submit your test scores if you feel they will strengthen your application submission. Please note that these test scores will be only one part of our holistic review process.

If you choose to submit your standardized tests scores, please upload the test scores report of your most recent PSAT, SAT, PreACT or ACT.

**ESSAY REQUIREMENTS**

Essay requirements vary by program. Please reference the academic program pages for more information. Essay prompts will be listed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is an I-20 and what do I do with it?**

The Form I-20 is used to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad. Please note that Canadian citizens are exempt from the visa requirement – Canadian citizens only need the I-20. With your I-20, you will be sent detailed instructions regarding travel to the U.S. and a mandatory immigration check-in. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Students who have received an I-20 from Carnegie Mellon must arrive on Pre-College's International Student Move-In Day (Friday prior to Opening Day) and complete a mandatory immigration check-in within the first week of programming in order to maintain legal status in the U.S.

**When will I get my I-20?**

Once all forms and original bank statements are sent to and received by the Office of International Education (OIE), you will receive the I-20 in approximately three weeks.

**I’m not a citizen or permanent resident/Green Card holder of the U.S. and I’d like to come to Pre-College. Can I attend the program as a tourist or on the visa waiver program?**

We do not recommend that students enroll in Carnegie Mellon’s Pre-College Programs using a visa waiver or tourist visa as that may be a violation of U.S. immigration regulations which restrict study for tourists (B-1/B-2) or visitors using the Visa Waiver Program, indicating “Enrollment in a course of study prohibited.” 8 CFR 214.2 (7). We encourage visitors to review the [U.S. State Department guidance about study](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) and what is an acceptable activity on a [B-1/B-2 visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html). Please consider the government’s guidance and their travel plans carefully to avoid difficulties at a U.S. Port of entry or for future travel to the U.S.

For more information on **Green Cards**, please visit <https://www.uscis.gov/green-card>.

**Once I get my I-20 and F-1 student visa and get to Pittsburgh, is there anything else I need to do or am I done with immigration requirements?**

There is one more important step to take. The Department of Homeland Security requires that you check in with the Office of International Education (OIE) to complete the immigration process. You must arrive in Pittsburgh on the Friday prior to Opening Day and complete a mandatory immigration check-in within the first week of programming in order to maintain legal status in the U.S. You must bring your original I-20 Certificate of Eligibility and your passport with you to Immigration Check-In.

**Are international applicants eligible for scholarships?**

No, international applicants are not eligible for scholarships.

**Should I arrive earlier than the Friday prior to Opening Day?**

No. We have built-in time for students to arrive on Friday and settle in so that international students can adjust prior to Opening Day.

**I have more questions. Who can I contact to help with immigration questions?**

Please don't hesitate to contact the Carnegie Mellon's Office of International Education by [email](mailto:oie@andrew.cmu.edu) or phone at 412-268-5231. Please indicate you are a Pre-College student when you reach out to OIE.

**IELTS:** 7.5 overall band score  
**TOEFL iBT or iBT Home Edition:**102 overall score
