THINK is a science, research, and innovation program for high school students.

Rather than requiring students to have completed a research project before applying, THINK caters to students who have done extensive research on the **background** of a potential research project, but lack the resources to complete the project themselves and are looking for additional guidance in the early stages of their project. The program is organized by a group of undergraduates at MIT.

the PREMISE

Selected finalists have **weekly mentorship meetings** with THINK team members for technical guidance, helpful resources, and updates on the projects progress and are given up to **$1,000 in funding** for their project. Additionally, if permitting, finalists are invited to a four-day **all-expenses paid trip to MIT's campus**, where they tour labs, present their research to MIT students and faculty, and hang out with members of the THINK team.

the PRIZE

GUIDELINES

THINK project proposals are science, technology, and engineering ideas that span many fields, from green technologies and practical devices to software applications. As long as it can be completed in one semester with a $1,000 budget, almost anything is fair game! A good proposal has an **insightful idea**, **clearly defined goals**, and a **well thought-out procedure for implementation**.

### For complete information on how to apply and an example finalist proposal, please download and read the full guidelines.
