 The goal of this one-week program is to introduce students to quantum information
science principles and basic quantum computing. No background in programming, physics,
or advanced mathematics is necessary.

Students will investigate quantum science concepts and perform quantum experiments,
simulations, and computing activities, while also learning about career pathways in
quantum technologies. Some basic classical and quantum principles that will be explored include wave-particle duality, interference and superposition, polarization, entanglement,
and measurement. Students will engage in a variety of hands-on activities including
IBM Quantum Composer simulations to explore quantum bits, quantum gates, and quantum
circuits. Students will interact with physics professors, graduate students, and undergraduate
students to learn about academic pathways and careers related to quantum physics and
computing.   

Throughout this program students will gain insights into how basic quantum concepts
relate to the world around them. They will also learn about some of the current developments
in the fields of quantum information science and technology.
