## What will scholars learn?

Scholars will learn one of our four custom, exclusive curricula:

What does it take to build a website? This curriculum is focused on building dynamic websites using 3 programming languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Scholars also learn the importance of responsive design, accessibility, and how to improve the UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) of a website.

WEB DEV

Artificial Intelligence plays a crucial role in today’s technology and is an integral part of our daily lives. This program empowers scholars with the knowledge to understand the fundamentals of AI while equipping them with the context to address bias as they progress in their tech careers. The AI/ML curriculum covers the foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning with topics including algorithms, data sets, and natural language processing to train a chatbot using Python.

MACHINE  
LEARNING

Everyone has a favorite app. Throughout camp, scholars will learn to code in Apple’s programming language, Swift, using the framework SwiftUI. By the end of camp, scholars will use Xcode to create fully-functioning iOS-capable mobile apps.

MOBILE APP

DATA SCIENCE

Data is all around us. In this curriculum, scholars examine data and draw meaningful insights through the use of SQL, Python, and data visualization tools. By the end of camp, scholars will build a visualization of a topic they are passionate about using data.
