Graduate students may be eligible for support from an NIDDK-funded [training grant](/research-funding/process/apply/funding-mechanisms/t32) or from an individual fellowship (F31).

Medical students enrolled in an M.D., Ph.D. program are eligible for individual fellowship (F30) support. NIDDK also supports medical students for both short-term (2-3 months) and for year-long research experiences. For additional information, see: [Medical Student Research Training Supplement](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/process/apply/funding-mechanisms/t32/medical-student-research-training-supplement)

Contact [NIDDK training program staff](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/training-career-development/program-staff-contacts) with questions well in advance of deadlines.
