Postdoctoral fellows and physician scientists in research fellowship training may be supported by training grants [T32](/research-funding/process/apply/funding-mechanisms/t32)s) and/or fellowships (F32s) for up to three years. This [NRSA](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants?CFID=2600963&CFTOKEN=e85c7a1e3c706348-AF71127F-050D-A435-804D8D26E54E30E7) funding cannot be used for specialized clinical training.

If your doctoral degree is older than 3-4 years, consider the [K-series awards](/research-funding/process/apply/funding-mechanisms/k-awards) for Junior Faculty/Transition.

Contact [NIDDK training program staff](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/training-career-development/program-staff-contacts) with questions well in advance of deadlines.
