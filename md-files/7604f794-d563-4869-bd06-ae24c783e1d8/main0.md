# For Trainees & Faculty Learners

The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) is dedicated to enhancing the translational research workforce through comprehensive, career-spanning training programs. Our programs are available to all members of the Yale University community and Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) personnel to support innovative and impactful translational research in our communities.

## Clinical Research Training

Copy Link

Each year, approximately 1,000 people participate in training sessions offered through YCCI. These programs are continually refined to reflect emerging needs identified through research operations, as well as evolving regulations and technologies. The curricula align with the nationally recognized *Leveled Core Competency Framework for Clinical Research Professionals* and are delivered by subject matter experts. Coursework covers topics such as Introduction to Translational Science, Clinical Research Foundations, Good Clinical Practice, Epic and OnCore systems, and a Certificate Program in the application of medical and research software. Didactic instruction is reinforced through experiential learning opportunities that strengthen knowledge retention and practical skill development, integrating core principles of Good Clinical Practice, Responsible Conduct of Research, Research Ethics, and Regulatory Compliance.

The YCCI Junior Faculty Scholars Program began in 2006 as the educational arm of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation. The mission remains to attract a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health and Biomedical Engineering who are interested in pursuing careers in any aspect (T0-T4) of translational research: to imbue them with a spirit of discovery; to train them in the use of state-of-the-art research tools; to give them the skills to work in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams; and to support their professional development.
