## About YSERE

Copy Link

The Yale Summer Enrichment Research Experience (YSERE) is a free 6-week summer program for undergraduate students who are currently enrolled in an accredited degree-granting institution other than Yale and considering a future career in biomedical research.

The program aims to:

* Expand opportunities for students from all backgrounds and experiences to enter the biomedical research community.
* Prepare students to successfully apply to biomedical graduate programs.
* Introduce students to PhDs and MD/PhDs and the myriad of research goals in biomedical

The YSERE 2025 program runs from July 7, 2025 – August 15, 2025. Students will participate in an intensive research program designed to expose them to the process of scientific discovery and the path to a PhD or MD/PhD degree. Each student will be matched with a research laboratory at Yale and work on a primary research project within their assigned laboratory for 6 weeks. In addition to conducting a primary research project, students will participate in weekly seminars, career discussions, and related social activities. The program aims to develop students’ skills on critical thinking, analysis of scientific literature, and effective scientific communication.

There is no fee to attend, and each student will receive a stipend. Students are required to make a full-time commitment, Monday-Friday, for the 6-week duration.

The YSERE 2025 is made possible by generous support from Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI), Yale Cooperative Center for Excellence in Hematology (YCCEH) and Yale Department of Genetics. YSERE 2025 is co-organized by YCCI, YCCEH, Yale Department of Genetics and Yale Stem Cell Center.
