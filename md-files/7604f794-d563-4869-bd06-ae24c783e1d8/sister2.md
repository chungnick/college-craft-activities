# For Students & Interns

The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) is committed to providing diverse learning and experiential opportunities for individuals exploring careers in clinical and translational research. Through a range of programs, YCCI supports students from high school through the post-baccalaureate level in gaining meaningful experience across disciplines such as public health, nursing, biomedical science, and research administration.

Participants learn through a combination of hands-on and classroom-based learning, guided by experienced research professionals and faculty mentors. These programs are designed to build core competencies aligned with each student’s academic and professional interests, while fostering curiosity, confidence, and a sense of belonging in the research community.

Together, these experiences reflect YCCI’s commitment to fostering talent from varied backgrounds and preparing the next generation of leaders in clinical and translational science.
