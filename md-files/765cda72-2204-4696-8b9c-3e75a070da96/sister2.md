Schedule Options  
 Each team will play on both days. If you would like a say in when your games are scheduled, pick four of the blocks, below, and rank them 1-4 in order of preference. Please don’t select all morning or all afternoon, as we won’t likely be able to honor your requests. We can only guarantee you will play in at least one of your top two choices of blocks, and we will work to schedule your top choices whenever possible.
