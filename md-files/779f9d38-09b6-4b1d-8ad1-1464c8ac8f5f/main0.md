# Summer Residential Program

In partnership with Tulane Pre-College, the LCCA Summer Program helps demystify the college search process and provides an immersive college experience. Louisiana rising juniors and seniors spend two weeks living on a college campus, taking classes, and learning the ins and outs of the college application process. In addition, they will visit a variety of colleges and universities from community colleges, public universities, private universities, and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

While the LCCA Summer Residential Program and Tulane’s Pre-College Program are similar, the LCCA’s program focuses on finding the right college fit, understanding financial aid, and perfecting your college application. The program is designed to support Louisiana students who are first in their families to attend college or who may not have access to college readiness resources. All students who attend the LCCA Summer Program will be assigned a mentor, who is a Higher Education professional, to support them through the college search and application process.

Thanks to a generous gift from Alec Cecil and Diane Zultowsky, every student admitted to the LCCA Summer Program will be awarded a scholarship covering most or all the cost of attendance.
