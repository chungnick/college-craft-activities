# LCCA: College Tours

Join the LCCA as we tour colleges and universities in the New Orleans area! There are so many amazing universities in our backyard. Public institutions, private universities, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and community colleges are all right here! On a typical tour, we will visit three to four different institutions in a single day. Even if you know you want to leave the state for college, visiting local schools is a great way to learn about the different types of institutions.

### Schools we visit:

* Delgado Community College
* Dillard University
* Loyola University New Orleans
* Tulane University
* University of New Orleans
* Xavier University
* Southern University
* University of Holy Cross

Tours are scheduled for groups of 20-25 students from a specific high school or community-based organization (CBO). High school counselors or CBO leaders wishing to learn more about tour opportunities should reach out to the LCCA at [collegeaccess@tulane.edu](mailto:collegeaccess@tulane.edu)
