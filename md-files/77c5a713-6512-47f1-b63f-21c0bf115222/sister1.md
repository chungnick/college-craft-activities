# Eligibility and Selection Criteria

## Eligibility Requirements

The State Pre-College Enrichment Program (S-PREP) operates in alignment with the eligibility criteria established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) for the Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP). The eligibility criteria are available on the [NYSED STEP webpage](https://www.nysed.gov/postsecondary-services/science-and-technology-entry-program-step) under "Eligibility" and are summarized below:

To be eligible for STEP, students must be:

* New York State Residents
* Enrolled in grades 7 -12
* Economically disadvantaged and/or
* In need of, or would greatly benefit from, academic enrichment or support in the STEM areas (to be determined locally)

Economically Disadvantaged:

* For the purpose of STEP, a student is economically disadvantaged if he or she meets the income eligibility criteria ([2021-26 STEP Income Eligibility Criteria](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/income-eligibility-criteria-21-26.pdf)). The eligibility standards set forth apply only at the time of admission as a first-time student to a STEP program. Once admitted, a student may continue to receive supportive services as needed, even if the family income rises above the current eligibility standards.
* Additional documentation of household income need not be collected to determine eligibility under economic disadvantage if the student falls into one of the following categories, and documentation is available to demonstrate:
  + the student's family is the recipient of family assistance program aid or safety net assistance through the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance or a county department of social services; or is the recipient of family day-care payments through the New York State Office of Children and Family Services or a county department of social services;
  + the student is living with foster parents and no monies are provided from the natural parents; or
  + the student is a ward of the State or a county.
  + the student is eligible for free or reduced lunch at his/her/their secondary school based upon family income (verified by the school).

Students enrolled in S-PREP are selected on the basis of character and academic merit that aligns with the eligibility criteria outlined below:

* Maintenance of an 80% grade average particularly in math and science
