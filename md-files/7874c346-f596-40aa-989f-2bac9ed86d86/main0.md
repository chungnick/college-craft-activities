The Rutgers Pre-College Summer Academies are one-week on campus residential programs, designed for international and U.S. high school (secondary school) students.

## Program Overview

The Rutgers Pre-College Summer Academies offer high school students an opportunity for an immersive academic experience that allows them to explore potential academic or career interests and experience campus life to prepare them for college.

During the week-long residential program,  all academies are held on the Rutgers–New Brunswick campus where the students reside and dorm for the entire week. Academy students will attend daily academic workshops, lectures, tours and activities, taught by leading practitioners and Rutgers instructors. Outside of class, students will participate in activities and events, scheduled every evening to engage and entertain, as well as form connections between the pre-college student cohort.

Students are supervised by program assistants (PAs) and resident assistants (RAs) throughout the entire program.
