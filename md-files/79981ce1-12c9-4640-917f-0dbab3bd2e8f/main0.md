# NYC Commuter Summer

The commuter option is open to students entering grades 9–12 and freshman year of college. Students who choose to live off-campus can still enjoy most campus resources, including special events, activities and commuter-specific lounges.

Play

## Academics

Students will choose from over 70 courses in a dozen subject areas, spending about four hours in class every weekday with a two-hour midday break. Classes are taught by expert instructors who will challenge students to think independently, critically, and creatively, with both open-mindedness and precision.

> I took a course that I absolutely loved; I made new friends from around the world; and I had access to a sprawling campus in the heart of a beautiful city.”

> – Lena K.  |  Brooklyn, New York

### Courses

### World-Class Instructors

Our diverse and international instructors are experts in their fields. They are committed to sharing their knowledge, insight, and experience with students.

[­­Learn more about our world-class instructors.](/columbia-experience/world-class-instructors)

### Credentials

Upon successful completion, students will earn a Columbia University Certification of Participation and an evaluation letter reflecting their performance in the program to further set them apart in the college application process.

## The Commuter Program

Students enrolled in either our 1-week or 3-week program who are entering grades 9–12 and freshman year of college are eligible to commute to campus. About 40% of our program participants commute, where they still enjoy many campus resources.

### Commuting to Campus

Whether you live in NYC or are commuting from nearby communities, there are many reliable, simple, and safe mass transit options.

[­­Learn more about commuting to campus.](/columbia-experience/commuting-campus)

## Daily Schedule

Classes meet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, separated by a 2-hr midday break. All students are encouraged to use their midday breaks to enjoy campus resources, activities, and events. Commuter students are also welcome to take part in early evening programming that ends before 6:30pm, but should plan to leave campus no later than 6:30pm Monday–Thursday. They may attend weekly community-building events on Friday evenings with permission from a parent/guardian.

Because students self-register in order to choose the course that works best for their schedule, details will vary for each student. [Visit the course pages](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/programs/explore-courses?interests=All&term=All&format=All&status=All&related_program=11872) for more information.

### Dining

Although meal plans are not available to commuter students, they are welcome to purchase meals at campus dining halls, where a wide variety of food is served cafeteria-style, including vegetarian and vegan options. Kosher and halal meals are also available and can be requested upon enrollment. There are many other dining options available on campus as well, such as cafes.

**Food Allergies**

Columbia Dining Services can accommodate virtually any allergy-based restrictions—our culinary team is trained in proper food allergy handling and our managers are certified by AllerTrain to manage food allergies. Dining Services will arrange special menus for students with more uncommon or complicated restrictions. Students and parents who have special requirements, questions, or concerns are welcome to [contact Dining Services](https://dining.columbia.edu/content/contact-us-0) to connect with a registered dietitian.

We are pleased to offer many resources across our 36-acre campus, including one of the Top 10 library systems in the country.

[## Program Policies](/admissions/program-policies)
