## Application tips

#### Start early

Start and submit your application before the deadline! Avoid last-minute technical errors that prevent your application from being submitted. Ask a trusted mentor, teacher, or friend to read your short-answer responses.

#### Be authentic

Do your short-answer responses reflect your uniqueness? Do they emphasize your passion for STEM? Use the Short Answer section to show us who you are! We want to know the real you.

#### Be selective

For recommenders, consider recent teachers who know you well and can attest to your strengths. Ask early so they have plenty of time to submit before the deadline. We know they’re busy, so be sure to thank them for taking the time to submit on your behalf.
