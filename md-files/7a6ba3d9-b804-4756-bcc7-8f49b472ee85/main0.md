# Music

### **Improve as a musician in a world-class conservatory environment while experiencing the life of a college student, studying and living in a university setting.**

## Program Overview

Pre-College Music mirrors the first weeks of Carnegie Mellon’s first-year undergraduate [School of Music](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/) curriculum. It is designed to prepare students for college-level auditions and the life of a music major. Students build skills and confidence through private studio lessons, major performing ensembles, and music support courses.

Admission to each course is based on a demonstrated performance level, which can be shown through an audition recording or a submitted portfolio. Regardless of a student’s skill level, there is a place for them to learn and grow in this program.

Our residential 6-week program stands out as the most comprehensive and enriching option, yielding the most significant results. This immersive experience allows students to explore the full breadth of our curriculum, advancing to more advanced repertoires both in solo work and ensemble performances.

We recognize, however, that this level of commitment may not be feasible for everyone. To accommodate varied schedules and needs, we offer alternative programs that provide a solid foundation for musical growth. The depth of your Pre-College Music experience and the extent of your development will correlate directly with the program you choose.

## Testimonials

Carnegie Mellon's Pre-College Music allows the students to get a taste of all sorts of paths in the music field. These opportunities allowed me to branch out from the narrow competitive path as a classical musician and discover new interests in courses like recording techniques and music technology. ~ Max G., Music 2023

I can see the growth in my child, not only as a musician, but as an individual. I loved the passion that was evident in the faculty and the participants. ~ Lloyd R. (Parent), Music 2025

## Application Essay Prompts

An essay is required for the following prompt (300-500 words):

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are scholarships available?**

Yes, but only to students in the Residential 6-week option.  
   
**I have a family member who lives in Pittsburgh. If I live with them for the summer, can I register for the Part-time: Commuter option?**

No. To be eligible as a Commuter student, the parent or legal guardian must have a permanent residence within approximately 30 miles of campus or within Allegheny County. There are no exceptions to this policy. Families who relocate temporarily to the Pittsburgh area are not eligible for commuter status.  
   
**What will I have to play for orchestra, wind ensemble, or chamber music placement auditions?**

You should arrive with an example of your best playing to present to the directors of the different ensembles. We are asking for these auditions for placement purposes only. This is not a ‘get-admitted-into-the-conservatory’ audition. The attitude is casual and relaxed. There are no repertoire requirements for these auditions. Think ‘example of my best playing.’ An excerpt of a movement or an etude would be good options.  
   
**What is the end-of-summer mock conservatory auditions?**

All full-time music students participate in mandatory end-of-summer mock conservatory auditions. The audition experience is a valuable component of the summer, allowing students the opportunity to go through the paces of an undergraduate conservatory audition. Your summer Pre-College private studio faculty will prepare you for the audition experience.

Composition majors and Music Technology / Electronic Music majors will have a formal portfolio review and interview as part of their mock conservatory audition process.   
    
 At the end of the summer program, each student receives written feedback from Pre-College faculty. These individualized comments review achievement in coursework and private lessons, and also offer advice for continuing study.

**Will I receive a transcript?**

No. All courses are offered for enrichment only. Pre-College Music does not produce official Carnegie Mellon grades or transcripts.  
  
**Who are the classroom faculty?**

The Pre-College Music faculty is made up of professors, conductors, instructors, and staff from its world-class conservatory program. Joining the core faculty will be working professionals engaged specifically for Pre-College Music. For additional faculty information, please contact us at music-precollege@andrew.cmu.edu.  
   
**I'll be on campus this summer in a program other than Music. Can I sign up for private lessons? May I take a music elective? May I play in one of the ensembles?**

Yes! We are happy to include students from other programs in our classes and ensembles.  
    
 The first concern is scheduling. Most students from other programs do not have the room in their schedule to take other courses, so you should first compare the music schedule and your own program schedule. Private lessons and chamber music are scheduled individually, so they are realistic options for most non-music majors. Placement auditions are required for orchestra, wind ensemble, and chamber music. Elective fees will apply to all these options.

Please note: Musical Theater students typically prefer private singing lesson options within the Pre-College Drama Program since private voice lessons with Pre-College Music focus on classical repertoire.

**What equipment do I need to bring from home?**

All students should bring their own instrument to use during the program (except for piano, which is provided). If you are flying, be sure to check your airline’s policies for transporting musical instruments.

Optional: Many students find it helpful to bring a laptop and/or tablet. However, if you prefer not to, computer labs and a music technology lab are available on campus.

**Can I rent an instrument for the program?**

Yes, instrument rentals are often available for the duration of the program. If you would like to rent, please indicate this on your enrollment forms. Students are responsible for any rental fees. This can be a good option if:

* You play more than one instrument, and your airline allows you to bring only one.
* You are unable to travel with your instrument.

**I am not a music major. Can I have access to the practice rooms?**

Practice rooms are ID-card restricted and reserved for students enrolled in music lessons or electives.

If you are enrolled in another Pre-College program, you may gain access by registering for a music elective (private lessons, elective courses, or ensembles).

If you’re not taking lessons, other practice options may be available on campus. For example, Fifth Avenue Neighborhood Commons and Morewood Gardens typically have pianos accessible for student use.
