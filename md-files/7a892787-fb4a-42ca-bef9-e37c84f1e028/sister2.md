## Summer ​Youth Program 2025

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: What is the appropriate grade level course for my child?**

Please enroll your child in the grade he/she will be entering in Fall of 2025.  For example, if your child is completing the 3rd grade in the spring, they should be enrolled in 4th grade classes for our summer program.

**Q: ​My child has problems with writing/math/science.  Will these courses be too advanced?**

The Young Writers and Math/Science classes are designed to put students at ease and improve students' skills. Teachers make allowances for the different ability levels in their classroom and structure lessons accordingly.  In addition, our courses are structured so that small group tutoring will be available to your child, should they need individualized instruction or targeted support.

**Q: My child is in GATE.  Are there accelerated classes available?**

Our classes provide academic enrichment and are designed to expand students' critical thinking skills, as well as give them numerous opportunities for hands-on learning.  In particular, small class sizes allow our team of experienced educators to tailor instruction according to your child's needs.  We have found that GATE children can benefit by not only learning new strategies for writing and problem solving, but also by learning to explain their solutions in both written and oral form.  Studies have shown that accelerated students often have as much difficulty with their critical thinking skills as do their peers and that relating to one's peers is an important part of the educational experience.  Hence, we recommend that you register your child for the class they will be entering in Fall 2025.

**Q: Can I switch classes/sessions?**

Any requests for class/session switches must be made via e-mail at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  Class switches will be made depending on availability.

**Q: Will there be homework?**

Minimal homework (15 minutes per day) may be given at the instructor's discretion.  However, our courses are structured so that students will have adequate time during the day to practice and apply skills learned.

**Q: Are there any discounts offered?**

We offer a $100 discount when you register your child for a combo course bundle (Morning Course & Afternoon Course)\*\*. When registering for courses, this discount will be automatically applied and reflected in your cart when you select the combo course option. If you've made a faulty purchase without a combo discount, please contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  
  
\*\*We will not have full day course registrations at Orange Lutheran as the morning and afternoon courses are repeated.  
  
UCI Faculty and Staff can request a discount by entering an active UCI Net ID at checkout.

**Q: IS ATTENDANCE MANDATORY?**

To gain the most from our courses, we highly recommend that students attend each day.  However, planned absences are entirely at the parent's discretion.  We encourage you to reach out to your child's instructor if you know they will need to miss a class.  Please note that we do not pro-rate our program.

**Q: CAN YOU ACCOMMODATE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS?**

We strive to create a class climate that is welcoming to all students. In doing so we know that there are some requirements for being successful with the program. Contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have a specific concern.

**Q: What is your student to teacher ratio?**

As of 2025, our student-teacher ratio is 16:1 or 26:2 across all of our sites.

**Q: What are the qualifications of your instructors?**

All of our instructors are credentialed and highly qualified experts in their field.  The majority are UCI Writing Project Fellows who have completed extensive training through participation in our 100-hour intensive professional development program.

**Q: DO YOU BACKGROUND CHECK YOUR STAFF?**

Yes, all of our teachers have gone through reference and background checks, and they are all employed by the University of California, Irvine.

**Q: WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?**

If you need to cancel your student's registration, please email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your Order Number (provided on the receipt of your registration). We allow for refunds (minus a $65 processing fee) up to 10 days before the start of the program.
