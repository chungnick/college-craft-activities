# Drama

### Learn techniques used by successful practitioners in the field. Prepare for the college audition process. Develop a clear picture of what the future could hold.

## Program Overview

Pre-College Drama prepares students for the college audition and interview process, illustrating the kind of creativity and discipline required of students studying a Bachelor of Fine Arts Drama curriculum. Classes are taught by accomplished Carnegie Mellon University faculty and adjunct professors.  
    
 Choose from one of our three options below to prepare for an education and career in theater:

**Acting** **Option:** Acting students will focus on audition preparation and classroom training rather than a production, allowing students to enter the college application and audition process with a repertoire of monologues as well as the skills needed to find material appropriate for their age and type. Along with the core classes of Acting, Audition, Acting for the Camera, and Dramaturgy, students in the Acting option will also receive training in Movement, Shakespeare, and Voice & Speech.   
    
 **Design/Production Option:**Students begin creating a cohesive portfolio upon which they can build for their college application process. They will be exposed to classes in Basic Design, Technical Production, and Stage & Production Management, as well as introductory work in Lighting, Sounds, Video/Media, Costumes, and Fabrication Technology. Additional supplementary subjects may be added and can change from year to year. All students in Pre-College Drama, including those in the Design/Production option, will take Dramaturgy.

**Music Theater Option:**Students focus on audition preparation and classroom training rather than a production, allowing students to enter the college application and audition process with a repertoire of monologues and songs, as well as the skills needed to find material appropriate for their age and type. Ballet and Jazz classes will provide inexperienced students with a dance foundation, while more experienced students will be placed with peers of similar ability allowing for further development. Music Theater students will also take classes in Acting, Audition, Acting for the Camera, Song Coaching, and Dramaturgy.

## Curriculum

Pre-College Drama is a six-week residential program for high school juniors and seniors that offers training and preparation for college auditions and interviews within an acclaimed drama conservatory. Each of the three options offered - Acting, Design/Production, and Musical Theater - has a different focus that will bring students unique experiences, challenging opportunities, and preparation for future theater endeavors. Through this program, students may find value in a wider, liberal arts undergraduate experience where they can explore all the opportunities afforded to them.

Students will attend classes for approximately eight hours a day, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a daily lunch break.

Pre-College Drama students are involved in a wide variety of classroom projects, topics, workshops, lectures and demonstrations, seminars, and masterclasses. All provide curriculum enrichment.

## Age and Grade

**Age:** You must be 16 years of age by June 20, 2026.  
**Grade:** You must be in high school between 10th and 11th grade or between 11th and 12th grade during the summer of 2026.

## Options

## Music Theater

Music Theater is designed to prepare high school juniors and seniors for college auditions. Students will learn how to search for appropriate audition monologues and songs, working with acting and singing faculty to develop repertoire and audition techniques. Students will learn what to expect when auditioning, what will be expected of them, and perform a mock audition with constructive feedback at the end of the program. This focused and specific feedback allows students to continue the work begun at Pre-College Drama with a clear idea of their strengths and weaknesses. Additional classes will provide support and background to improve the student’s training.

## Electives

All students in the **Acting or Music Theater** options can choose from one of several electives included in the performance curriculum to supplement their core classes. (Design/Production students do not have room in their schedules for an elective.)

Students will be asked to provide a first, second, and third choice of elective. Class sizes are small or can conflict with a required class making it impossible for a student to participate in their first-choice option. All of the electives offered provide excellent supplemental opportunities for students and are all equally informative. The elective choices currently are:

* **Improv:** Students will work on their feet to explore in-the-moment actions and reactions to improve their improvisational skills.
* **Dramatic Writing:** Students with an interest in writing will enjoy working on their own scripts, which will be cast and performed as a staged reading near the end of the program.
* **Music Theater Rep:** This class offers the opportunity for students to delve further into choosing songs for auditions, in addition to similar work in Song Coaching class or private, one-on-one voice lessons.
* **Analyzing Text:** This class is dedicated to deep dives into the textual work of plays, providing insights and background that may not be apparent upon a superficial reading of the material.
* **Directing:** Students will explore the craft of directing, exploring viewpoints, staging, and other directorial choices.
* **Tap:** Acting and Music Theater majors are invited to expand their dance experience by studying tap dancing. Levels are determined based on skill levels. Beginners are welcome.
* **History of Musical Theater:** Students in this course will learn about significant works, artists, and moments in musical theater history across stage and screen.

***Elective choices are subject to change.***

## Optional Workshops

Between one and three optional workshops and masterclasses are held in the evenings, Monday through Thursday. Weekends are intended for homework, independent rehearsal, and Pre-College Student Affairs activities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this a summer camp or a conservatory experience?**

The School of Drama’s Pre-College Program is not a summer camp. It is an intensive program modeled after our undergraduate BFA curriculum. The program provides a strong basis for the student to decide to pursue further professional theater training. Attendance is mandatory in all classes in order to keep up with the rigors of the programs. Students who fail to attend class and/or to meet program requirements without explicit approval from their program directors may face an academic expulsion.

**Why don't I need an audition tape?**

Pre-College Drama focuses on preparing students for the audition process rather than the execution of a production. Requirement of a video audition for admittance to Pre-College Drama would undermine the goals of the program.

**Will I need to bring monologues or music?**

If you have material you are working on or would like to work on, please bring it along, but it is not required.

**Will there be a final production?**

There is no final production. Our program is focused on process not product.

**Will I earn college credit from this program?**

No, Pre-College Drama students do not earn college credit.

**Where can I get the necessary textbooks?**

You will be provided with a small book list to purchase in advance of the program within a month of your arrival.

**What are the dance wear requirements?**

Students in the Music Theater option are the only ones that will need to bring dancewear. You will be provided with a list of recommended clothing upon acceptance. 

If you have specific questions concerning dance wear, contact Maria Stoy at [mstoy@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:mstoy@andrew.cmu.edu) or 412.268.3284.

**Do students in the Acting option have special clothing requirements?**

Students in the Acting option only need to bring loose-fitting, comfortable clothing for Movement class. No dancewear is required unless taking Tap for an elective.

**Do students in the Design/Production option need any special clothing or tools?**

Design/Production students should bring close-toed shoes and a laptop computer. A supply kit will be prepared in advance at the university bookstore for purchase before your arrival.

**Do I need to bring a computer to Pre-College Drama?**

Design/Production students are required to bring a laptop able to run Adobe software (provided by the program).

Acting and Music Theater students are required to bring either a laptop or tablet for use in Dramaturgy class.

**Can I take an elective in the School of Music or another department?**

No. Due to class times and varying schedules, you cannot take classes outside Pre-College Drama.

**I'm a Pre-College student, but not enrolled in Pre-College Drama. Can I take a dance, audition or improv class?**

No. Due to the number of students enrolled in Pre-College Drama, we do not have space in our classes to accommodate students from other programs.
