## Are letters of recommendation required?

Letters of recommendation are only required for students applying for the [Agricultural Institute](https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-institute/students/admissions/). Scholarship applications may also require additional letters of recommendation.

For all other academic programs, we consider many factors in our review process and feel we receive the best insight from the essay responses the student submits themselves. While we do not require letters of recommendation, applicants are able to submit them if they choose and they will be considered along with all other application materials. Since it is not a required material, we do not have guidelines or restrictions on who can write a letter of recommendation or how they should be submitted.

If you choose to submit a letter, you can [email it to our office](mailto:undergrad-admissions@ncsu.edu) or upload it through your [wolfPAW](https://apply.ncsu.edu/apply/status) account after submitting your application.

## How do I know if my college or dual enrollment credits transfer to NC State?

**Dual Enrollment**  
We do not require your dual enrollment transcript when you apply, but you will need to submit an official final college transcript if you decide to enroll at NC State and would like credit for your college coursework. For more information on transferable credit, we encourage you to visit our [Credit Opportunities](https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/credit-opportunities/) page.

**Transfer Applicants**  
We will evaluate your transcripts once you apply to the institution and you will be provided a transfer credit report if you are admitted.\* Only courses from a regionally accredited institution are eligible for evaluation and you must receive a grade of a C- or higher to receive credit. Use our [Transfer Planner](https://transfer.ncsu.edu/resources/nc-state-transfer-planner/) to plan your coursework and see how your transfer credits fulfill degree requirements.

*\*International Transfer Applicants*

*We are unable to determine how many of your credits will transfer to NC State when you apply. If you are admitted, your academic department will then determine how many of your non-U.S. university credits will transfer toward your degree. This will require that you submit additional documentation. Read more about what you will be expected to submit on our [Transfer Credit Evaluation page](https://transfer.ncsu.edu/transfer-credit-evaluation/). You will need to have a course-by-course evaluation completed by World Education Services (WES) and have it submitted to our office.*

## How do I find my transfer credit report?

Transfer students who are admitted will be able to view a preliminary transfer credit report on [MyPack Portal](http://mypack.ncsu.edu). Some of your courses may still be under review, but you are able to see a preliminary report to view how your credits will transfer.

A final transfer credit report is contingent on submission of final transcripts. The timeline for receiving a final report varies for coursework completed in the U.S. and coursework completed outside of the U.S. Read more about our transfer credit evaluation processes here.

## Can I transfer credits that I earned during the semesters associated with COVID-19?

During the semesters associated with COVID-19 (spring 2020 – summer 2021), NC State will honor Pass/Fail (or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grades from any regionally accredited institution. During the application process, Pass/Fail grades will be reviewed but will not be calculated into the applicants cumulative GPA, which we consider in the application review process.

* Transfer credit will be awarded for a “Pass” final grade.
* No transfer credit will be awarded for a “Fail” final grade.
* Consistent with our current policy, if students choose to keep their letter grades, courses with a C- or higher will be eligible for transfer credit.
* A course-by-course evaluation for each applicant will be conducted of all courses to determine transfer ability and if credit will be awarded at NC State for each transferable course as an elective or direct equivalency.
* Each academic department determines how these credits are awarded to a students degree plan if they enroll.

## Course Selection and Schedule Changes

Our office doesn’t offer advice on proposed schedule changes. If you are considering a schedule change, we would urge you to discuss it with your school counselor to consider the impact of the change and to ensure you will still meet the UNC System [**Minimum Course Requirements**](https://www.northcarolina.edu/future-students/admission-requirements/) (MCR).

## What classes should I take at my current high school?

We encourage all students to enroll in a challenging curriculum throughout high school. All students are expected to pursue and maintain the highest level of academic success throughout their senior year.

Students should be aware that we have the right to re-review, change or rescind a decision if it is determined that the student has not maintained the appropriate level of academic rigor or performed at the level of their academic ability throughout their senior year.

You can look at everything we consider in the application review process [here](https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/first-year/application-review/).

## Am I required to complete a foreign language course before I apply?

While students applying to NC State are not *required* to take two units of world language prior to applying, the completion of two sequential world language courses is recommended to satisfy the [NC State General Education Program’s Foreign Language Proficiency Requirement](https://catalog.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/gep-category-requirements/foreign-language-proficiency/).

## I’m interested in transferring to NC State and am changing my course schedule at my current school. What classes should I take?

When considering changes to your course schedule, we encourage you to speak to your advisor and review the [recommended coursework](https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/transfers/recommendations) for the academic program you are interested in.

If you make any changes to your course schedule, make sure to email us so we can update your application.

## **Can I still be admitted to NC State if I graduate from high school early?**

The North Carolina State Board of Education issued a policy beginning with the 2024-25 school year that allows high school students who meet certain requirements to graduate after three years.

Applicants who graduate from high school early may still be admissible. In addition to meeting the [minimum course requirements](https://www.northcarolina.edu/future-students/admission-requirements/) (MCR) established by the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina System, applicants who are most competitive for admission have taken challenging courses offered at their school that align with their academic interests and demonstrate their ability for future success (honors, AP, IB, dual enrollment, etc.). Learn more about what we look for in our application review process at [go.ncsu.edu/academic-achievement](http://go.ncsu.edu/academic-achievement).

## Residency

The [**Residency Determination Service (RDS)**](https://ncresidency.cfnc.org/residencyInfo/) is responsible for all tuition residency classifications, reclassification requests and appeals. To apply for in-state residency consideration for tuition purposes, you must apply through the Residency Determination Service (RDS) for a Residency Classification Number (RCN).  
  
At NC State, the application review process is the same for both in-state and out-of-state applicants. As a member institution of the UNC System, only 18% of NC State’s enrolling first-year class can be from outside of North Carolina. Due to the current quantity of out-of-state applications we receive, residency does not impact admissions decisions. Residency is only used for tuition purposes for enrolled students.

## When should I apply for residency?

You can apply for residency at any time throughout your application process. You will need to include your Residency Classification Number (RCN) on your application or through your [wolfPAW](https://apply.ncsu.edu/apply/status) account **after being admitted.**

You will be considered out of state for tuition (billing) purposes until you receive a RCN that shows a validated in-state status. Your residency status is valid for 15 months.

## Where can I find my RCN?

You can find your RCN on your Residency Determination Service of North Carolina (RDS) account. To create your account or sign in, visit: <https://ncresidency.cfnc.org/residency/#/RESlogin>.

## How do I update my residency classification?

**If you have not been admitted**, you can email our office at [undergrad-admissions@ncsu.edu](mailto:undergrad-admissions@ncsu.edu) to update your RCN.

**If you have been admitted**, you can enter your RCN through your [wolfPAW](https://apply.ncsu.edu/apply/status) account.

Admitted students can follow the steps below to view/update your tuition classification.

* Log in to your MyPackPortal and navigate to the section where your residency information is located:
  + Student homepage > Personal Information tile > Residency Information
* From this screen, verify the RCN displayed is correct.
* If it isn’t, re-enter it and click “Save RCN.” Once the RCN has been verified as correct, click “Request Residency Data” button to pull the latest information from RDS.
* If the tuition residency reads as in-state and there is a Y next to Match and a Y next to Validated, the student will be paying in-state tuition.
* If there is a N next to Match, it may mean the RCN on file with RDS does not match the information the student has provided. If there is a N next to Validated, RDS has not validated the in-state status yet and it will be updated in the next few weeks.
* If your expiration date is before the start of the fall semester, your residency status will show as out-of-state. You will need to complete the residency form again through RDS before the expiration date if you believe you should have in-state tuition status.

## Who do I contact if I have questions about my residency?

Undergraduate Admissions no longer makes any residency determinations. As of February 20, 2017, all undergraduate residency decisions are made by the Residency Determination Service of North Carolina (RDS).
