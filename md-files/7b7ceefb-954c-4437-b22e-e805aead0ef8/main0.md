# Annenberg Youth Academy for Media and Civic Engagement

The Annenberg Youth Academy for Media and Civic Engagement is a three-week summer intensive academy for 26 talented high school students from the communities surrounding the USC University Park and Health Science Campuses. Students are exposed to the equivalent of first-year college-level courses and develop a rich conceptual understanding and practice of the necessary role that media communications and journalism play in fashioning civic-minded thought leaders and innovators.

AYA strengthens students’ skills in writing, critical thought, public speech and debate, multimedia production, interviewing and ethnography — all essential competencies required for excellence in and out of the classroom in the 21st century. The students are introduced to USC Annenberg’s undergraduate programs and services and possible careers in media and journalism. They have opportunities to meet the school’s innovative scholars and practitioners who are shaping the future of communication, journalism and public relations, and creating interdisciplinary solutions for complex societal and organizational challenges.

**Students must reside and attend high school in Los Angeles County to be eligible to apply. Application is scheduled to open on March 3, 2025, and close on April 14, 2025.**
