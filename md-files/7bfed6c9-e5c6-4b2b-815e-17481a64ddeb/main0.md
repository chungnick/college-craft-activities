**Note:  Applications for RSI 2026 are now closed.**

Each summer, 100 of the world's most accomplished high school students gather at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the Research Science Institute (RSI). RSI is the first cost-free to students, summer science & engineering program to combine on-campus course work in scientific theory with off-campus work in science and technology research.

Participants experience the entire research cycle from start to finish. They read the most current literature in their field, execute a detailed research plan, and deliver [conference-style oral and written reports](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute-rsi/distinguished-written-papers-and-oral-presentations) on their findings.

RSI scholars first participate in a week of intensive STEM classes with accomplished professors. The heart of RSI is the five week research internship where students conduct individual projects under the tutelage of mentors who are experienced scientists and researchers. During the final week of RSI, students prepare [written and oral presentations](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute-rsi/distinguished-written-papers-and-oral-presentations) on their research projects.
