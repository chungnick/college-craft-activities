# Life at RSI

Image

**Students begin their summer with one week of seminars highlighting current research topics in biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, physics, and humanities.**

RSI students gain access to the extensive computing resources of MIT, and receive the tools they will need to find current publications, to model complex systems, to prepare a scientific paper, and to make a conference-style presentation. The RSI evening lecture series begins the first week and continues throughout the summer and provides students with the ability to meet face-to-face with science and technology leaders such as Nobel laureates and technology entrepreneurs. Past RSI sessions have included [these speakers (pdf).](/sites/default/files/rsi/Lecture_Series_Speakers_0.pdf)

Students receive their research project assignments from their research mentors at the end of the first week, and many begin reading advanced texts and recent journal articles over the first weekend. Students join their laboratories at the beginning of the second week, spending "business hours plus" engaged in guided research from the second through the fifth week. All participants report the results of their work back to the Institute, preparing papers and oral presentations at a level appropriate for an academic conference. An outside panel of Boston-area academic and corporate scientists selects five papers and five presentations for special commendation during the last week of the program.

Among the rigorous academic curriculum students enjoy a variety of field trips to nearby cultural attractions and expeditions to science and technology facilities in the Boston Area. Past RSI sessions have participated in Boston's July 4th celebration on the Esplanade and enjoyed a weekend trip to discover the natural beauty of New England. Program staff are extremely responsive to student interest, and the activities of each RSI session reflect the unique character of the participants.
