#### Engineering Co-Majors Position Students for Multidimensional Careers

The University of Dayton is the first Ohio university to offer [co-majors in engineering](/blogs/engineering/2025/25-12-02-comajors.php). And when the UD School of Engineering launched its new co-major programs this summer, faculty expected curiosity. What they didn’t expect was just how quickly that curiosity would turn into excitement—especially among prospective students exploring their options for fall 2026.
