## FAQ

What is the deadline again?

You must submit your experimental idea online on or before April 10, 2026 at 11:59 pm PDT.

Who is eligible?

Students in grades 7–12 who attend a U.S. public, private, or home school are eligible to participate in Genes in Space. Applicants must be enrolled to study within the U.S. or in U.S. territories.

Do I need any biotechnology equipment or access to a lab to enter the competition?

No. Your submission will be judged on creative and scientific merit of your idea. If selected as the winner, you will attend Space Biology Camp to prepare your experiment for space travel.

Does my experiment need to use Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)?

Not necessarily! You may use any tool in the [Genes in Space Toolkit](https://www.genesinspace.org/toolkit/) - alone or together. However, access to these tools or prior knowledge of how to use them is not required.

Can I access other molecular biology tools aboard the ISS?

For the purposes of your proposal, yes. Your Genes in Space proposal may include any tool that is necessary for your experiment. For example, many prior Genes in Space experiments have involved analysis by gel electrophoresis after samples have been returned to Earth. [Genes in Space-6](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html#id=7893) incorporated CRISPR and direct DNA sequencing of samples amplified on-orbit. Genes in Space winners will work alongside their mentors, astronauts, and space biologists to push the boundaries of DNA analysis in space!

What biotech equipment will finalist schools be awarded?

Finalists’ schools will be awarded a complete [DNA Discovery System](https://www.minipcr.com/product/minipcr-dna-discovery-system-x/). Each kit includes a miniPCR thermal cycler, a blueGel™ electrophoresis system, and a 20 µl micropipette- a $950 value

If I win, will my experiment be done in space?

Yes! The winning experimental design will be conducted aboard the International Space Station, pending approval from The ISS National Laboratory. The exact launch date will be determined after winners are announced.

Can my experiment utilize quantitative PCR (qPCR)?

miniPCR is a conventional (end point) PCR thermal cycler. However, you can propose an experiment that uses quantitative PCR (also referred to as real-time PCR or qPCR). It won’t affect your chances of winning the competition.

Can I use artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to complete my proposal?

AI tools may not be used for idea generation or writing content, but there are acceptable uses of this technology. [Continue here to read our framework for how A.I. tools can be used responsibly in our competition.](https://www.genesinspace.org/news/blog/can-i-use-artificial-intelligence-in-my-application/)

How will I know if I win?

All finalists will be contacted, and the results will be announced on this website, in the Genes in Space newsletter, and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/genesinspace), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/genesinspace.bsky.social), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/genesinspace/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GenesInSpace/).

Where will the finals round of the 2026 competition be held?

2026 finalists will present their ideas July 28-30 to contest judges at Countdown to Discovery in Houston, TX.

Where can I find information about previous finalists?

You can use the [“Finalists” tag](https://www.genesinspace.org/news/blog/category/finalists/) on our blog. You can also see the Finalists from [2020](https://www.genesinspace.org/2020-finalist-launchpad/), [2021](https://www.genesinspace.org/2021-finalist-launchpad/), [2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpe8Q2ujhqsuDqFZt3jOT2xAYQi-5LMwY) , and [2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpe8Q2ujhqsvXHHh104DKH8DsD2o-2Fjy), [2024](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpe8Q2ujhqsufwm6GM3VrlAw5_sM3mwif) , and [2025](https://www.genesinspace.org/news/press/genes-in-space-announces-five-finalist-teams-for-2025-national-competition/) present their proposals to our judges, or read their proposals in the [Journal of Emerging Investigators](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/) ([2019](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/documents/jei_genes_in_space), [2020](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/documents/jei_genes_in_space_2020), [2021](https://emerginginvestigators.org/documents/genes_in_space_2021), [2022](https://emerginginvestigators.org/documents/genes_in_space_2022),and [2023](https://emerginginvestigators.org/documents/genes_in_space_2023), [2024](https://emerginginvestigators.org/documents/genes_in_space_2024) and [2025](https://emerginginvestigators.org/collaborators/genes-in-space)) !

I have so many great ideas, can I submit more than one proposal to the Genes in Space contest?

No, not to the same Genes in Space contest. We can only accept one proposal per student per contest year. However you are welcome to participate in Genes in Space every year that you are eligible. That means you can submit your best idea this year and save your other ideas to submit in future years.

I don't attend school in the United States. Can I participate?

Unfortunately no, the current Genes in Space contest is only open to students in 7-12th grade who live on United States soil (US States and territories). In 2016 we offered a contest in the [United Arab Emirates](/international-contests/) and hope to offer more international contests in the future.

Can I form a team with students from different schools?

Absolutely! In fact, our 2018 winning team was made up of students from different high schools.

I am homeschooled. Can I participate?

Yes! We welcome submissions from homeschooled students.

My question has not been answered. What do I do if I have another question?
