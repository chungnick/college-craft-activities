# For High School Students Neuroscience Camp

Drexel University College of Medicine is seeking highly motivated current high school sophomores and juniors who are enrolled in an academic curriculum and demonstrate strong interest in neuroscience topics and research. Under the direction of [Jed Shumsky, PhD](/medicine/faculty/profiles/jed-shumsky/ "Jed Shumsky, PhD"), a group of highly driven high school students will learn the fundamental concepts of neuroscience and basic lab techniques in molecular neurobiology, neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. By attending the Neuroscience Camp, participants will have the opportunity to:

* Learn about the brain and spinal cord from award-winning faculty and their graduate students
* Experience live brain activity recordings
* Participate in lectures on:
  + Brain and spinal cord anatomy
  + Electrophysiology
  + Cellular neuroscience
  + Sensory processing
  + Neuropathology
  + Neuropharmacology
  + Comparative neuroanatomy
  + Brain machine interfacing

The Neuroscience Camp features a lab project that will include neuroscience laboratory techniques and data analysis. Participants will also receive instruction in literature searching and project presentation.

At the end of camp, participants will earn a certificate of completion.

**This is not a residential program. Housing will not be provided.**

## 2025 Camp Dates

This year's camp will take place from Monday, July 21, 2025 to Friday, August 1, 2025. [**Download the 2025 Neuroscience Camp schedule.**](/~/media/Files/medicine/drexel-pdfs/programs/program-neuroscience/drexel-neuroscience-camp-schedule-2025.ashx?la=en "Download the 2025 Neuroscience Camp schedule.")

[**2023 Neuroscience Summer Camp visits the DUCOM anatomy lab!**](# "2023 Neuroscience Summer Camp visits the DUCOM anatomy lab!")

## Eligibility

The Neuroscience Camp is open to rising high school juniors and seniors with a background in biology, chemistry or research; admission to the camp is competitive. Applicants must submit transcripts and two letters of recommendation as part of their application.

## Registration Fee

The cost of the Neuroscience Camp is $2,500.

## What will a typical day be like?

Program content will be offered **in person at the Queen Lane Campus in Philadelphia**. This may change to a remote summer program depending on the guidelines established by the [Pennsylvania Department of Health](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx "Pennsylvania Department of Health") and [Philadelphia Department of Public Health](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/ "Philadelphia Department of Public Health"). Our highest priority is protecting the health and well-being of the entire Drexel community. We are examining every facet of learning, living and working at the University to ensure that the latest evidence-based public health measures are in place to make our program as safe as it can be. In the event that we must shift to a remote delivery of Neuroscience Camp, we will notify you in time to obtain a full refund, if you are accepted and choose not to participate.

**Sample Agenda:**

* 10 a.m. – 12 p.m.: **Morning Conference**  
  Lecture presented by a Drexel University College of Medicine faculty member or senior graduate student.
* 12 – 1 p.m.**: Lunch**   
  Lunch
  will be provided (please contact us if you have any specific dietary requirements).
* 1 – 4 p.m.: **Laboratory Project**  
  Students will learn common neuroscience laboratory procedures and will work on small group lab projects together under the direction of a senior graduate student.

In addition, participants will take field trips to the [Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University](https://ansp.org/ "Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University") and the [Franklin Institute](https://www.fi.edu/ "Franklin Institute") to further their understanding of the brain in a fun and educational setting.

## How to Apply

Please fill out the [online application](https://drexel.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e5RaocK3X0EwPki "online application") in its entirety. Applicants must submit transcripts and two letters of recommendation as part of their application.

## Application Deadline

The application deadline is **Friday, April 4, 2025.**
