## [WHAT ARE THE DATES AND TIMES OF CAMP?](#fs-panel-2249)

*Camp Louisville is a day camp running from 9 am-3 pm. Camp Louisville will include three individual, week-long sessions running from Monday, June 16th through Friday, July 11th (excluding Juneteenth and the week of Independence Day).*

## [WHY IS THE ENGINEERING/ROBOTICS WEEK PRICED HIGHER?](#fs-panel-7257)

*The Engineering/Robotics session is priced higher than the other Camp Louisville offerings because equipment needed to build and program robots includes costly supplies such as computers, software, and hardware, as well as maintenance of these supplies. Additionally, this course is being taught by a faculty member with professional expertise in designing, building, coding, and engineering coupled with teaching experience.*

## [WHAT SHOULD I WEAR TO CAMP?](#fs-panel-2253)

*Campers should wear comfortable summer clothes with closed-toed shoes. All campers will receive a Camp Louisville t-shirt on their first day that they have the option to wear.*

## [ARE REFUNDS POSSIBLE?](#fs-panel-2255)

*Th**e summer camp budget, the hiring of teachers and staff, and the purchase of supplies are based upon the number of participants enrolled in the summer camp. Due to this, tuition and fees are non-refundable for an individual student.*
