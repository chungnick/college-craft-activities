# Tuition & Scholarship Opportunities

### Investing in your daughter's education is one of the most important things you can do as a parent.

Louisville offers a quality education and supportive environment that exceeds what many far more costly schools have to offer. It is more than just a place where girls come to learn literature, math, science, and other academics. Louisville is a place where girls gain the experiences they need to become women who shape the world.

At the heart of the mission of our founding Sisters is the belief that cost should not prevent deserving young women from receiving Louisville's exceptional education. We continue to honor this commitment by offering $1.6 million in financial aid annually to 52% of our students so that every student has the opportunity to attend a school that is wholly geared towards helping her succeed.
