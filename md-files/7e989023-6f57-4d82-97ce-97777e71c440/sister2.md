* [Transfer Student Admission](#fs-panel-3998)

#### [9th Grade Admission](#fs-panel-3996)

Prospective families for the Class of 2030 are invited to [**Apply for Admission**](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in)before January 16, 2026 in order to be automatically considered for scholarships and be guaranteed to receive their admissions decision on Friday, March 6, 2026 at 5 PM. Applications received after this date will be considered on a case-by-case basis. After [creating a user account](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in "Parent Portal Login") (or logging into an existing one), follow these steps to complete the application process:

1. Once the [Application for Admission](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in "Parent Portal Login") is completely submitted, including the application fee, you will be given access to an Admissions Checklist that will walk you through each step of the admissions process.
2. Using the checklist, you can request 6th-8th grade transcripts, recommendations from Math and English teachers in addition to a personal recommendation, and schedule your own interview date & time. Additionally, applicants will need to complete a brief student statement and essay in order to be considered for admission.
3. You can easily check the progress of your application in the checklist, seeing in real time as documents are submitted.

*Please note that Louisville High School no longer requires the High School Placement Test (H.S.P.T.) as part of the admissions process. Scores received from other schools offering the H.S.P.T. may certainly be received for review but will not be used in the determination of admission to Louisville or placement in Honors-level coursework.*

If your daughter wishes to be considered for Honors courses in her Freshman year, there will be optional subject-specific testing dates held in January of 2026. Applicants may indicate which test(s), if any, they wish to attend as part of the Admissions Checklist.

#### [Transfer Student Admission](#fs-panel-3998)

Transfer applications are generally considered for 9th through 11th grade students. Those entering the 12th grade are occasionally admitted on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the Admissions Office for further information if you wish to be considered for transfer into the 12th grade.

Families interested in transferring to Louisville can [**Apply for Admission**](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in)on a rolling basis. After [creating a user account](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in "Parent Portal Login") (or logging into an existing one), follow these steps to complete the application process:

1. Once the [Application for Admission](https://louisvillehs.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in "Parent Portal Login") is completely submitted, including the application fee, you will be given access to an Admissions Checklist that will walk you through each step of the admissions process.

Once all required documentation has been submitted, the Admissions Office will reach out to schedule a mutually convenient time for your family's Admissions Interview. We aim to provide transfer admissions decisions as soon as possible to allow your family time to prepare for transferring into the closest semester or academic year.

#### [International Students Admission](#fs-panel-4000)

Louisville welcomes international students, who are an important part of the Louisville family. Louisville High School has been certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll international students under the category of F-1 only. We define the term "international student" as a student who is not a U.S. citizen, does not hold a U.S. passport, and is not a Permanent Resident of the U.S. These are the students for whom we will need to issue a form I-20 and who will need an F-1 visa to enter the U.S.

#### MATERIALS TO SUBMIT

International students who wish to apply to Louisville High School must contact [Elena de Mattos, Director of Admissions](mailto:edemattos@louisvillehs.org), for further information. Please note that Louisville High School does not partner with agencies representing international students, and any applicant wishing to apply must plan to live with a parent or close relative in the U.S. while enrolled at Louisville.
