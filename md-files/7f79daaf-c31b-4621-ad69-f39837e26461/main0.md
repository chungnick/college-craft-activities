## Explore Your Intellectual Passions Before College

---

The Online Research Program at UC Irvine School of Medicine is a three-week mentored program designed to increase the exposure of high school students to research methods. The instructor is a member of the UC Irvine School of Medicine faculty, with coaches selected from UC Irvine undergraduates or postgraduates majoring in areas related to biomedical research.

All the activities will be held online, and the schedule is flexible to allow students work on assignments at their own pace. The students will get instruction via email, zoom meetings and/or podcast on how to complete the projects. At the completion of the program the students will be able to:

* Understand the core concepts for responsible conduct of research involving human subjects
* Understand the importance of evidence-based medicine
* Learn how to critically evaluate the medical literature on a given topic
* Write an organized research report
* Submit an abstract to a national meeting where, if accepted, the student’s name will be listed as a co-author
* Network with undergraduate and postgraduate coaches and get advice about college

## Program Dates

---

#### Session One: June 22–July 10, 2026

#### Session Two: July 13–July 31, 2026

## Program Details

* Have a minimum unweighted GPA of 3.3 out of 4
* Are interested in research in the healthcare field

How to Apply

Please note that due to the high demand and interest in our program, applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis to ensure a fair process. Our program typically closes to new applications by the end of January or the beginning of February. Qualified applicants who have submitted all of the necessary documents will be accepted on a first-come basis until we reach capacity. **Priority will be given to those attending higher grades in high school.**

#### **Application Requirements:**

* [Submit Application](https://apps.som.uci.edu/SummerPremed/StudentApplicationWrap.aspx)
* A copy of your transcripts (they can be unofficial, please send them to [highschoolresearch@hs.uci.edu]( highschoolresearch@hs.uci.edu " highschoolresearch@hs.uci.edu"))

Scholarship Eligibility

The Summer Online Research Program is committed to serving high school students regardless of their ability to pay. The 2025 summer program is offering scholarships to qualified applicants from low-income families who attend a high school in underserved areas of Southern California. Tax forms will be required prior to acceptance.

Scholarships offered are limited, and the following criteria are used to determine scholarship eligibility:

* **Quality of the scholarship essay**: It is important that the student demonstrates how their diversity and/or experiences related to financial hardships has motivated them to make contributions to the society as a healthcare provider or researcher.
* **Come from a family with low income**. We use a percentage of the [Federal Poverty Level](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/federal-poverty-guidelines/) as the income criteria for program participation.

Applicants must also indicate whether they want to be considered for the summer program if a scholarship is not awarded.

To apply for a scholarship, please complete and return the following items:

* [Submit Scholarship Application](https://apps.som.uci.edu/SummerPremed/ScholarshipApplicationWrap.aspx)
* **You must complete the regular application in addition to the scholarship application**
* High school transcripts (either official or unofficial) - must have a minimum unweighted GPA of 3.3 out of 4
* 2024 or 2025 tax information

Please send questions to [highschoolresearch@hs.uci.edu](mailto:highschoolresearch@hs.uci.edu).

Coach/Mentor Opportunities

The UC Irvine School of Medicine Summer Online Research Program provides mentoring opportunities for UC Irvine undergraduate, postgraduate and medical students who are interested in health and research careers. The program is designed to offer unique opportunities for college students to mentor high school students under the supervision of a School of Medicine faculty mentor on a research project. The coaches will work with Behnoosh Afghani, MD, to choose one of the topics related to their interests and to learn about evidence-based medicine and literature review. Coaches will receive a stipend.

Depending on the availability of conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of the research will be submitted as an abstract to a national meeting. If the abstract is accepted, the coach will present the abstract at the national meeting.

#### Session One:

June 22–July 10, 2026

#### Session Two:

July 13–July 31, 2026

#### Requirements

We will only accept four to five coaches for each session.

* Preference is given to undergraduate or postgraduate students at UCI in a biomedical-relevant major, including medical students.
* Coaches must have completed at least two years of college with a GPA of >3.3 and must have some research experience.
