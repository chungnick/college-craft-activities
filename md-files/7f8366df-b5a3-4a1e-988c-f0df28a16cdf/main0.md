# Camp 2025

---

Girls Talk Math is holding an in-person camp in Summer 2025! Camp will now run **July 7 - July 18** on weekdays, from **9 am to 4 pm** each day. Attendance is open to everyone. Rising-9th to rising-12th grade students who attend high school within commuting distance of the University can apply. Camp activities involve learning mathematics outside of the standard curriculum, attending mini-lectures on math, as well as recording and publishing a podcast about a famous female mathematician. Additionally, there will be special events such as panels and interviews with women mathematicians. Click on [Blog](blog.html) to see what last summer's students learned or take a listen to [podcasts](https://soundcloud.com/girls_talk_math/jennifer-balakrishnan?in=girls_talk_math/sets/summer-2019-at-umd-college-park) from past campers.
