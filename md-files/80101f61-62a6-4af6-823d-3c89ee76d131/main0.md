# Pre-College Summer Language Institute

Learn an entire year of a language online this summer! This program is ideal for advanced high school students who want the opportunity to either learn a new language or continue learning a language in classes with current UChicago students.

Students have the opportunity to take modern or ancient language courses. Beginning and intermediate intensive language courses are designed for students wishing to develop proficiency across all four language skills—speaking, listening, reading, and writing.

## Details

* Current high school students in 11th or 12th grade are eligible.
* Courses are between six and eight weeks long. Read each course listing carefully.
* Each intensive Summer Language course is 300 units of credit. This is equivalent to three quarter-long (9 week) courses, and meets for a least 90 contact hours.
* Pre-College Summer Language Institute courses are taught online. There is no hybrid or in-person option for these courses. Students enrolled in an online course cannot live in residence on campus.

## How to Apply

* Pre-College students must complete and submit the Summer Session application (including the email of a teacher who will write a recommendation for you), upload a complete high school transcript, and submit a short essay.
* Financial aid (covering some or all of the program fee) is available for students who qualify. Please refer to our [Costs & Aid page](https://summer-dev-previews.netlify.app/pre-college/pre-college-costs/) for more information.
