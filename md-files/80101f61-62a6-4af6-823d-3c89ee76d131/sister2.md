* ## Financial Aid for 2-8 Week Programs

  Summer Session awards aid to pre-college students based on demonstrated financial need on a first-come, first-served basis. Students who require aid to attend should apply by the Priority Deadline, as the number of awards is limited. In general, admitted students whose annual household income is $125,000 USD or below are eligible for financial support. There is space on the application to provide additional context for the additional aid requested.

  To be considered for need-based financial aid, students must complete the Financial Aid section of the application and submit all required supporting documentation when they apply. Awards cannot be made after an admissions decision has been released.

  ### **Financial Aid for 2-8 Week Programs**

  Aid will be applied toward the program fee (e.g., tuition, housing, and dining) only. Students are responsible for costs related to their travel to and from UChicago, required course materials, and any incidental expenses. International students should also budget for visa-related costs. Students applying for financial aid in 2-8 Week Programs need to upload financial documents on the Financial Aid section of the application.

  + **Only partial aid awards are available and need-based aid is not guaranteed. We are unable to offer full aid awards.**
  + U.S. citizens and permanent residents: submit your parents' most recent 1040s (including all schedules and attachments) and W2s. Proof of eligibility for public assistance such as TANF or SNAP may be submitted instead of 1040s and W2s; see the Financial Aid section of the application for more information.
  + International students: provide your parents' most recent income tax forms, a letter from their employer stating their position, annual salary and benefits, and years of service, and a bank statement showing available funds. All information must be translated into English.
  + If you have any questions about what to provide, please contact us at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu).

  Aid amounts vary based on program cost and household income. No full aid awards are available. Depending on their financial eligibility and the availability of funds, students may be responsible for the following amounts:

  |  | Household Income under $125,000 USD | Household Income under $80,000 USD |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Programs | Program Fee After Aid Applied | Program Fee After Aid Applied |
