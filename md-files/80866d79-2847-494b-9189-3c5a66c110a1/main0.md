UC Santa Barbara Summer Sessions offers two premier pre-college programs that provide students with unique opportunities to earn college credit while engaging in interdisciplinary research. Simultaneously, these programs are designed to shape each student's academic, professional, personal, and social development. Our programs challenge high school students by exposing them to the academic excellence of UC Santa Barbara while immersing them in the university’s environment.

The Research Mentorship Program (RMP) and the Summer Research Academies (SRA) allow participants to deep-dive into an interdisciplinary subject while discovering new knowledge through university-level research. These transformative summer experiences help students get ahead and hone skills that prepare them to excel in higher education.
