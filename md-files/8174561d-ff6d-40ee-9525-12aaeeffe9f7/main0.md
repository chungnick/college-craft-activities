# Brown Cancer Center

The Brown Cancer Center is a highly translational and clinical research institution that is committed to the discovery and implementation of the most advanced cancer treatments for our patients

about](https://uoflhealth.org/locations/brown-cancer-center/giving-back/)

The University of Louisville’s Brown Cancer Center (BCC) is a highly collaborative and collegial collection of clinical, translational and basic science researchers. Under the leadership of Dr. Jason Chesney, MD, PhD, the Cancer Center is pushing toward NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center designation and plans to submit a P30 application by the end of 2028.

Over the past several years, the BCC has sought out and recruited an outstanding, highly dedicated and diverse team of basic and translational researchers who work hand-in-hand with our community outreach/screening programs along with our highly skilled team of sub-specialty-trained medical and surgical oncologists. Supported by an exceptionally strong and motivated team of nursing and support staff, we strive to provide the best care, newest clinical trials and most effective treatment options for cancer patients from across the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

## Featured Research & Projects

Here are just a few of our ongoing research projects.

### The Role of HA Remodeling and Mesenchymal Transition in Glioblastoma/NCI-funded cancer research

Dr. Joseph Chen’s work on glioblastoma (GBM) cell interactions with tissue matrix is identifying crucial pathways involved in driving GBM metastases and leading to new therapeutic options for GBM patients.

### A lung cancer vaccine based on exosomes of induced pluripotent stem cells/NCI-funded cancer research

Drs. Chi Li and Kavitha Yaddanapudi’s recent work has identified a highly unique and effective cancer vaccine that is based on the shared antigenic makeup of tumors and pluripotent stem cells.

### Mechanisms underlying radiation-induced dysphagia in head and neck cancer/NCI-funded cancer research

Dr. Suzanne King’s work will identify the mechanisms involved in radiation-induced dysphagia that is common in head and neck cancer patients. Studies will highlight points of dysfunction to target for future treatments.
