## ***Online Applications for Summer Arts and Design Intensive 2026 will open on February 20***

## Summer Arts & Design Intensive Camp 2026

The School of Art at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro is pleased to announce the 13th year of the Summer Arts and Design Intensive program. This summer, we will offer a one-week residential art program for up to 100 high school artists. New to this year’s program, SADI 2026 will offer a Filmmaking class through a collaboration between the School of Art and the Department of Media Studies. The program will encompass a range of art forms, including drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography, graphic design, animation, and Filmmaking.

The art faculty from the UNCG School of Art and Department of Media Studies will mentor the student artists participating in the 2026 Summer Arts and Design Intensive. The SADI staff will also include professional artists, art educators, and preservice art teachers. Together, we will provide college-level studio practices for each student and support them in embarking on a unique, innovative creative journey.

During SADI, students will participate in faculty-led studio sessions that combine traditional techniques with contemporary experimentation to help them reach their full potential. There will also be enrichment activities, including artist talks, visits to Art Galleries, and a career seminar on the arts. A longstanding SADI tradition presents the concluding student art exhibition, to be held at the Gatewood Gallery in the School of Art building. This exhibition will take place on Friday afternoon, the final day of SADI, and will celebrate the artistic achievements of the campers alongside their families, friends, and the art community.

The application process for the UNCG Summer Arts and Design Intensive is entirely online. If you are a parent or guardian applying for your child, please complete the application. Use only a laptop or desktop computer to complete the registration. After you apply, you will receive a confirmation email confirming that your registration is complete.
