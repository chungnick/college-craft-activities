## Day Camp Information

While most SADI campers stay in the dormitories during the program, we also have day campers who commute between UNCG and home. This page provides information to help day campers and their parents understand the procedures for dropping off and picking up their campers.

### Sunday Check-in

Day campers should report to the lobby of the Gatewood Studio Arts Center between 2:00 pm and 4:00 p.m., park in the ground parking lot next to the building on the first evening (Sunday) of SADI. Campers should bring their completed medical form. Dinner will be served at the UNCG Dining Hall between 4:00 pm – 5:30 pm. Campers will participate in the SADI orientation at 5:30 pm and the first studio class starting at 6:00 pm in the Gatewood Studio Arts Center.

### Dropping off campers during the week

Day campers should arrive at their classroom no later than 9:00 a.m. Monday thru Friday, but they should arrive at the Dining Hall by 7:45 a.m. if they want to eat breakfast (which you’ve already paid for).

### Picking Up Campers Sunday Through Thursday

Parents should plan to pick up their campers at 9:00 p.m. on Sunday thru Thursday evenings at the lobby of the Gatewood Studio Arts Center. An art education counselor will escort your camper each night until your camper is picked up (no later than 9:20 pm).

### Picking Up Campers on Friday

The campers’ parents, family, and friends are invited to the closing art exhibition celebrating the campers’ artistic exploration and creative outcomes. The art exhibition will be held at the Gatewood Gallery at 5 pm. We will conclude the art exhibition and the closing reception at 6 pm. Parents should plan to pick up their campers, the artwork, and all other belongings starting at 6 pm.

Dinner will be served at the UNCG Dining Hall from 4:00 – 5:00 pm.

### Carpooling and riding with someone other than a parent

We certainly understand that groups of students from the same neighborhood or school would like to ride to and from camp together each day as a matter of convenience. This is certainly allowed, but if your child is going to be part of a carpool during camp or someone besides a parent is going to pick up a day camper, you should notify the camp staff at the Sunday Evening Registration, and it would be best to submit this in writing. Once the camp staff knows, we can notify the escort counselors so that your camper goes home with the right person.

If there is an emergency during the week and your camper needs to be picked up by someone else, give us a call at 336.256.1091 or an email at [e\_lim@uncg.edu](mailto:e_lim@uncg.edu).
