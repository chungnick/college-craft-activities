# Fast-track Research Immersion Program

## About FtRI

FtRI is a research-intensive, structured and mentored experience meant to catch participants
up to speed with the skills and discipline content knowledge built during the first
two semesters of our First-year Research Immersion (FRI) program. Upon completion
of the FtRI program, students will be admitted to the third and final semester of
the FRI program in the following fall semester where they will have the opportunity
to complete their proposed research projects alongside current FRI students in one
of our ten research streams.

FtRI consists of one, four-credit course over 5 weeks in the summer during Summer
Session I. Participation in the program is a full-time (40 hr/wk) commitment.

The FtRI course will cover the FRI program's Semester 1 research methods course and
Semester 2 course which covers theory, techniques, protocols and data management of
the research. Successful completion of FtRI will admit students to the FRI program
in the subsequent fall where they will participate in the FRI program's Research Stream
Part 2 course which consists of applying the skills from FtRI to a research problem,
as student teams plan their experiments, conduct their experiments, analyze the results,
and present their results.

A dedicated Research Educator designs and oversees the research experience for each
Research Stream in collaboration with a team of three to five tenure/tenure-track
faculty members. Laboratories have been designed, constructed and outfitted to provide
the innovative infrastructure to fully integrate undergraduate students in leading-edge
research in their Research Stream.

For the research conducted, students will work in teams of three to five. We have
students work inter-dependently because developing teamwork and collaborative skills
are so important in research today. Each student team will work on a research question
that is related to the overall objective of the Research Stream for that year.

FtRI students learn how to talk about their research, collaborate and identify their
next steps in research. Students will finish this two-course sequence (Research Stream
1 during summer and Research Stream 2 during fall) with a public poster session displaying
their results.

## Course Credit

These courses will count toward a Binghamton University degree. Upon completion of
the FRI program in the fall with your participation in the FRI Research Stream 2 course,
the courses, together, will also fulfill the Composition and Laboratory general education
requirements and count toward the major that corresponds to the rubric code of the
courses.

You will be billed for 4 credits during the summer to cover participation in FtRI.
In addition to tuition, there are comprehensive, laboratory and activity fees as shown
in the table below.

| Comprehensive Fee | $57.20/credit x 4 credits = $228.80 | $57.20/credit x 4 credits = $228.80 |
| Laboratory Fee | $150 | $150 |
| **Total Course Costs** | $1,558.80 | $4,870.80 |

University from June 15 - June 27th. As such, they may need to pay for on-campus housing
in order to be present in person.

\*\*For the Biogeochemistry FtRI stream, an additional field station fee covers the
course components (tuition, fees, housing, and meals) at the Chincoteague Bay Field
Station in Wallops Island, VA.

## Additional Options

* A campus resident hall in a double-occupancy room at a discounted rate of 50%. You
  would have to provide your own sheets and towels. More information can be found through

## Application Process

FtRI is particularly appropriate for STEM majors who have completed their first year
and/or STEM majors who have not had an intensive research experience. FtRI is for
students who have had the equivalent of at least one year of college and introductory
college science, math and/or engineering (= STEM) courses in their intended STEM major.
AP scores of 4 or 5 may apply to that requirement.

Admission into the FtRI program is based on the student's academic record indicating
sufficient preparation to be successful, the student's essay indicating background
and career aspirations, and letters of recommendation from professionals familiar
with the student's aptitude for science and/or engineering.

The FtRI **application for 2026 will open in December**. FtRI has rolling admission and **application review starts March 2nd, 2026**. The number of slots in the FtRI program are limited, so we recommend that you apply
early. Applicants are notified within a few weeks of **application deadline on April 5th, 2026.**

* For non-Binghamton University students, official college transcript(s) must be submitted,
  so we can review your math and science courses. Submit these to sri@binghamton.edu.Scanned
  copies of your official transcript(s) are preferred.
  + Cross out or cover your Social Security number (SSN) prior to scanning your transcript.
    Your SSN should not appear on your scanned transcript.
  + Remember to scan your files with care, making sure that they are clear and legible.
    The files you upload are what the Admissions Review Committee will see.
  + Individual files should be under 2 MB. Preferred file format is PDF. Other accepted
    file formats include: .doc, .docx, .rtf, .jpg and .tif

  To continue in the FRI program (from Research Stream Part 1 to Research Stream Part
  2), students are expected to engage fully in the FtRI project, complete all assignments
  in the FtRI course satisfactorily, and demonstrate a steadily increasing ability to
  engage in research-specific projects as they move through the two-semester course
  sequence. Students who fail to meet these standards will not be allowed to continue.
  Students should monitor their own progress and discuss any concerns with the FtRI
  staff.

## FtRI Student Quotes

"I first applied to the FtRI program because I wanted to gain research experience
before applying to get my PharmD. However, I realized that I don’t have an interest
in working as a healthcare professional and would rather do research instead. I came
to this conclusion because I enjoyed my time on this course, and realized that I only
wanted to apply for a PharmD for the wrong reasons. I am glad that I got some clarity
to do what I am passionate about, by going through this experience with my classmates."

"It [FtRI] was specifically aimed at people in my situation, who had discovered their
major later than others."

"The fast approach to learning was responsible for the development of my new, practical
skills."
