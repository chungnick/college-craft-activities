# Summer Housing

## Summer housing is available May 26-Aug 9

**Summer housing is only available to undergraduate students who have a direct University-related
summer affiliation.** Although space is limited, Summer housing is available for both Binghamton University
students and non-Binghamton University students who are taking summer courses and/or
engaging in University-sponsored programs or research which requires being on campus
for the Summer. The **deadline** to submit summer housing applications is **Friday, April 25**.

* Term 1 housing dates: May 26 - July 1

is not available on a weekly basis.

All Summer housing is in the Apartments Community. Students living in Summer housing
will be assigned by Residential Life and should expect to share an apartment with
other Summer residents.

## Housing type

Binghamton University offers two types of housing. When completing the housing application,
all students are required to select a housing type.

### **Housing Type 1: Housing based on Gender Identity**

* Students who choose this housing type live with others who share the same gender identity.

Information regarding gender identity and how to enter your gender identity with the
University is available on the [Student Records website](/registrar/student/sex_namechange_ssnupdate.html).

### **Housing Type 2: ALL Gender Housing**

* Students who choose this housing type live with others who may or may not share the
  same gender identity, with the intention of creating a welcoming environment for all.
* Students who select ALL Gender Housing **agree** to **live with apartment mates of any gender identity**. Students who do not wish to live with others of every gender identity should select
  Housing Type 1.

## Apartment-style living

Apartment style living is an independent living experience in which students are self-sufficient
with respect to cooking, cleaning, etc.

Our apartments are fully furnished and offer single bedrooms with a shared living
room, bathroom, and kitchen. Kitchens contain a full-sized refrigerator, stove/oven,
sink, and cabinets. Students provide their own microwave (less than 1,000 watts) if
they want one. Automatic dishwashers are not permitted.

While the apartments are furnished, students do need to provide their own bedding,
cooking items (pots, pans, plates/utensils, etc.) as well as paper towels, toilet
paper, garbage bags and cleaning products. See our [What to Bring guide](/residential-life/whattobring.html) for more details.

Most apartments do not have air conditioning. Students are welcome to bring fans but
air conditioners are not permitted.

## Dining services during the Summer

Full-service dining is not provided on campus during the Summer months. Retail dining
is open for limited hours Monday through Friday for breakfast and lunch. For complete
information on Summer dining options and hours, visit the [dining services web page](https://binghamton.sodexomyway.com/en-us/).

## Mail services

Students living in Summer housing will be issued a PO Box number. Mail is delivered
Monday-Friday.

* Susquehanna mailroom is located outside the Apartments Community Area Office – Choconut
  102, between Brandywine and Choconut. The doorway is on the left, under the covered
  outdoor entryway, before you enter the hallway to the office.
* The Hillside mailroom is located behind Belmont, across from Palisades.
