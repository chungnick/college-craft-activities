## **HSRA Summer Program**

---

Application will open late January 2026!

The summer High School Research Academy (HSRA) provides high school students with an immersive and **hands-on five-week interdisciplinary non-residential summer** **research experience** at the University of Texas at Austin campus.

Students participate in research projects in active College of Natural Sciences (CNS) laboratories related to the exciting fields of biochemistry, biology, environmental science, genetics, neuroscience, genome engineering, data analytics, ecology, and more. Participants will learn cutting edge research techniques while gaining valuable insights and experiences through interaction with UT students and faculty in CNS undergraduate research groups.

This unique opportunity provides a real taste of life as a researcher. By being involved in STEM research early, students can experience the joy of discovery that is central to being a scientist.

### **HSRA Program Highlights**

Each HSRA participant will:

* actively engage in a five week authentic research experience in a UT laboratory
* collaborate with peers, undergraduates and UT faculty
* earn NSC309 UT extension course credit and receive an HSRA t-shirt.
* participate in Wednesday Seminars hosted by UT guest speakers
* present (and take home!) a printed poster showcasing their summer research productivity at our closing HSRA Research Symposium
