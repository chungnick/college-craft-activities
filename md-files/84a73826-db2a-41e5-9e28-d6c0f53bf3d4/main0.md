Sylvester’s Office of Education and Training sponsors programs and partners with University research programs to increase cancer research career exploration opportunities for high school students and college undergraduates.

## High School Students

High school research volunteer opportunities take place only during the summer months. More information can be found on the UHealth volunteer [page](https://umiamihealth.org/patient-,-a-,-visitors/patients-,-a-,-families/volunteering-at-uhealth/summer-programs/high-school-student-research-trainee).

## Sylvester Program for Academic Research and Knowledge (SPARK)

In collaboration with the Office of Undergraduate Research and Community Outreach, the goal of **SPARK** is to engage University of Miami undergraduate students in longitudinal cancer research opportunities (laboratory, computational, population, clinical) to improve the pipeline of PhD, MD, and MD/PhD candidates interested in cancer research careers. This multi-year undergraduate initiative provides students with the opportunity to earn class credit or monetary stipends while gaining cancer research experience.

### Candidate Eligibility Criteria:

* Rising sophomores
* Interest in cancer research
* Strong academic achievements, particularly in science and math courses, will be considered
* Ability to dedicate 8 hours of lab work per week per semester with a minimum two-semester commitment

### Program Expectations:

* **Year 1:** At the completion of two semesters, students must submit a 2-page summary of their research experience
* **Year 2:** At the completion of four semesters, students must submit a 12-page research paper
* **Year 3:** At the completion of six semesters, students will work with their mentor to select a research journal and prepare a paper for submission. Publication is not required; only submission of the paper is expected.

For more information contact [ugrinfo@miami.edu](mailto:ugrinfo@miami.edu) or [sccctrainee@miami.edu](mailto:sccctrainee@miami.edu).

## Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)

The SURF program is an intensive, paid, ten-week research training experience designed for college students interested in biomedical science careers. SURF students participate in seminars and workshops focused on strategies for gaining acceptance to graduate school, giving scientific presentations, conducting responsible research, and critically reading scientific literature. Meritorious applicants interested in cancer research are selected and matched with Sylvester investigators working on team-based, catchment area-relevant cancer projects. Cancer-specific education is provided through interactive sessions and hands-on research training in wet or dry laboratories.  To learn more, please click on [https://med.miami.edu/graduate-studies/summer-programs/](https://med.miami.edu/en/graduate-studies/summer-programs)

## Comprehensive Research Experiences to Advance Training and Education (CREATE) for Future Cancer Researchers

The Comprehensive Research Experiences to Advance Training and Education (CREATE) program is an expansion of the existing 10-week SURF program, made possible by an R25 grant from the National Cancer Institute. Rising juniors and seniors with an interest in cancer biology will have the opportunity to experience mentored research in the labs of world-class faculty, as well as the extensive technological, clinical and educational resources at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Through academic development and mentoring, CREATE scholars will access a roadmap of the most cutting-edge tools and concepts in oncology.

We will provide a stipend and housing on our Coral Gables campus for all CREATE scholars.

For more information, please email [surf@miami.edu](mailto:surf@miami.edu) or visit the [CREATE program page](/en/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/education-and-training/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/comprehensive-research-experiences-to-advance-training-and-education-(create)-for-future-cancer-researchers).

## American Cancer Society Internship Program

The American Cancer Society Internship Program recruits motivated undergraduate students from Florida academic institutions for a 10-week summer intensive and year-round mentoring and career development activities. During the summer, ACS students will be immersed in hands-on, innovative biomedical research, clinical shadowing, career development sessions, and networking events with exceptional faculty members from Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.

For more information, please email [acs.ug@miami.edu](mailto:acs.ug@miami.edu) or visit [ACS program page](/en/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/education-and-training/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/american-cancer-society-internship-program).

## American Cancer Society Post-Baccalaureate Fellows Program

The American Cancer Society funds the ACS Post-Baccalaureate Fellows Program, which aims to strengthen the cancer workforce by increasing the number of individuals in the biomedical field. The ACS Post-Baccalaureate Fellows Program is a two-year cancer research experience designed for individuals with a bachelor’s degree who intend to pursue medical school or graduate studies in biomedical science, public health, or a health profession.

For more information, please email [acs.pb@miami.edu](mailto:acs.pb@miami.edu) or visit the [ACS Post-Baccalaureate program page](/en/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/education-and-training/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/american-cancer-society-post-baccalaureate-program).
