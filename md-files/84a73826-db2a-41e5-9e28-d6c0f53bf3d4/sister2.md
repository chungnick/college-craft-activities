The goal of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (UMMSOM) is to enhance the research workforce with a group of scientists-in-training who are well-versed in cutting-edge concepts and technologies. Our program’s short-term objectives are to highlight the value of research-based graduate programs and to educate participants in conducting original, rigorous, and multidisciplinary research in various biomedical fields. We seek to accomplish this through timely exposure to the breadth of biomedical concepts and methodology, coupled with supportive mentoring and programmatic resources to nurture interest in research-based careers. The long-term objective of our program is to foster a robust pipeline of motivated, forward-thinking young researchers who will contribute to the betterment of society through science.

SURF is a nationally competitive 10-week program that immerses students in hands-on, innovative biomedical research. It is funded by an NCI R25 grant to expand its oncology research focus through the [CREATE](https://umiamihealth.org/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/education-and-training/high-school-students-and-undergraduates/comprehensive-research-experiences-to-advance-training-and-education-(create)-for-future-cancer-researchers) scholars sub-program and by the Office of the Graduate Studies to fund Dean’s scholars who want to pursue non-oncology-based biomedical research. In total, SURF hosts 30 scholars every summer. SURFers graduate from the program with comprehensive preparation and training in multiple aspects of research, including overarching education about bioinformatics, academic entrepreneurship, clinical translation of basic science and data science. In addition, SURFers benefit from a full schedule of career development sessions, including learning how to write and present research effectively, critical reading of scientific literature, and rigorous ethical conduct of research. They are also provided information regarding the spectrum of research-oriented, higher degree-granting programs offered at the Miller School, including our program in Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. Program, our NIH T32-funded M.D./Ph.D. Program, and several master’s programs.

SURFers will have the opportunity to work in the laboratories of our exceptional faculty members spanning the UMMSOM departments, in the following disciplines:
