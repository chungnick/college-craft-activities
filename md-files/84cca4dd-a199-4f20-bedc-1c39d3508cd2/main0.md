# WIE RISE! An Introduction to Engineering Research (Virtual)

## *Summer 2026 Program Information*

### Program Overview

This virtual program, hosted by current Maryland Engineering students, was initiated through the [RISE Program](https://eng.umd.edu/rise) (the Clark School’s Leadership Academy) in partnership with the [Women in Engineering (WIE) Program](https://eng.umd.edu/wie). This program is for **rising 9th - 12th grade** students and provides an introduction to engineering through the field of research. Students will explore different engineering disciplines each day of the week as they learn about various engineering research labs at the University of Maryland. Students will learn the various aspects of scientific research papers, participate in asynchronous at-home friendly experiments, and engage with current Maryland Engineering undergraduate students. The entire program will be conducted virtually. Our programs are open to all students!

---

### Program Curriculum

Each day you will engage with different engineering disciplines (Aerospace, Bioengineering, Chemical, Civil & Environmental, Electrical and Computer, Fire Protection, Materials Science, Mechanical) through virtual lab tours and demos as well as learn about the various aspects of scientific research papers.

---

### Program Goals

* Introduce high school students to various engineering majors through the field of engineering research
* Showcase the interdisciplinary nature of engineering
* Explore the various aspects of scientific research

*\*This is NOT a credit bearing program. It is meant to introduce high school students to various disciplines in engineering and the interdisciplinary nature of the profession and is not a research internship.  Participation in WIE RISE does not guarantee admission to the University of Maryland.*
