### College Prep FAQs

  
[General Questions](frequently-asked-questions.html#CPP general)[Application](frequently-asked-questions.html#CPP application questions) [Academic Life](frequently-asked-questions.html#academic-life)[ONLINE PROGRAMS](https://precollege.northwestern.edu/)

### General Questions

***When will the application system open?***  
The application system for summer 2026 will open in December 2025. The list of courses for credit will be updated January 2026 for summer 2026. 

***What is the cost of the program?***  
Tuition differs for College Preparation Program credit courses, online programs, and IN FOCUS seminars. Visit the [**Cost & Aid page**](tuition.html) for details on tuition. 

***Are there any scholarships or financial aid available?***  
Our scholarship and financial aid options are available to domestic students who are entering their senior year of high school; scholarship applications are due February 16, 2026. Please note, students must submit their program application including transcripts by the scholarship application deadline in addition to the scholarship application to be considered.   
   
***Will participation in the College Preparation Program affect my chances of getting into Northwestern University?***    
While successful enrollment in college-level courses is a great head-start to your college career, many facets of your application will contribute to your acceptance to college. Participation in the CPP is one of the many pieces of your application profile; it alone does not guarantee your acceptance to Northwestern University.   
   
***If I have an obligation that requires me to be away from campus during part of the College Preparation Program, may I still attend?***  
CPP courses only meet for a short period of time. As a result, missing even one class meeting could be detrimental to your final grade.  You are expected to contact the CPP office and your instructor if you have a conflict with any class while you are in the CPP program. Other summertime commitments should be scheduled for before or after the College Prep Program.   
   
***Who else takes classes in the summer?***  
College Prep students enrolled in college credit courses take undergraduate courses with other Northwestern and visiting university students during the summer. Only high school College Prep students enroll in the online enrichment program and IN FOCUS Seminars. 

***How safe is Northwestern?***  
Several measures are in place to support student safety, including, 'blue-light' emergency telephones fast alert Northwestern police if there is any problem. These phones are conveniently located at several key locations on campus. At night, the police take extra measures to guarantee safety to students, embarking on more numerous patrols through the campus. You may check the [crime alert](https://www.northwestern.edu/up/facts-and-figures/campus-crime/daily-blotter/) page for updated safety information.

### Application Questions

***Who may apply?***  
Credit courses are open to rising Juniors and Seniors. IN FOCUS seminars are open to rising Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The Online Enrichment Program is open to students age 13+. Information on application requirements is [**here**](admission.html).   
   
***When is the application deadline?***  
The application deadline is in March 2026. Set date to be announced. Late applications will not be accepted.   
   
***Will I be notified if my application is incomplete?***   
We encourage you to check your application portal (the same link you used to start your application) for any missing materials, and contact CPP Admissions at [cppadmissions@northwestern.edu](mailto:cpp@northwestern.edu) to submit any missing materials.   
   
***How soon will I know if I have been accepted?***  
After the admissions committee begins reviewing completed applications in January, you will receive an email of the admission decision approximately 3-6 weeks of receipt of your completed application online and all application materials are received to the College Prep Program office. Your application will not be reviewed until it is complete. Admission to the program is on a rolling basis. Admitted students secure their space in the program by submitting their program deposit fee. Please note that admission to the program does not guarantee enrollment.

***How many classes may I take?***

Credit: US students may take one or more classes for credit, but they must be in the same modality (Online or in-person). International students must take two credit classes to be considered a full-time student on an F-1 Visa.

IN FOCUS: US and international students may attend more than one IN FOCUS class as long as they occur in separate sessions.

### Academic Life

***What courses may I take?***  
College Prep students may enroll in college credit courses, or intensive IN FOCUS Seminars. All courses are taught by Northwestern-affiliated instructors who look forward to the same level of commitment and involvement from you that they do from the rest of Northwestern’s student body.   
   
Generally, CPP participants may take any 100 or 200 level college credit courses — and some 300 level courses — offered on the Evanston or Chicago campuses. [**College credit courses**](https://sps.northwestern.edu/college-preparation/credit-courses.html) are available in virtually any subject area. The [IN FOCUS](https://sps.northwestern.edu/college-preparation/in-focus-sessions.html) seminars are designed for students who want an intensive learning experience in a specific subject area such as business, medicine, law, STEM, and humanities.   
   
Can I take a class in a program (IN FOCUS or Credit) for which I'm not enrolled in?   
You cannot be active in more than one program or take classes from a program other than that which you are enrolled. 

***Where is the bookstore and when can I buy books?***  
For college credit courses, you can buy your textbooks at the university bookstores when you arrive or pre-order and pay for books online, and then pick them up when you arrive on campus. Some textbooks may also be available through online vendors. Prices vary, but we recommend that you plan for at least $100 for each class (more for science texts) if you plan to purchase course materials after you arrive. If your class is taught in Evanston, you will purchase your books from the [**Norris University Center bookstore**](http://northwestern.bncollege.com/) (847-491-3990) or potentially an online book retailer.

### Campus Life

***Will I be able to live on campus during my summer 2026 program?***  
Residential housing is available for summer 2026.

***Where can I worship?***  
Please visit Northwestern's [**Religious Life**](http://www.northwestern.edu/chaplain) page for information on religious life at Northwestern University.   
   
***Can I bring my car?***  
Commuter students may use their cars to travel to and from campus but may not transport other CPP participants. Students must purchase their own parking passes from the [**Evanston Campus Parking**](http://www.northwestern.edu/up/parking/) office.    
   
***How big is the campus?***  
Northwestern University is located on a 240-acre campus in [**Evanston**](http://www.northwestern.edu/about/facts/index.html), the first suburb north of Chicago.
