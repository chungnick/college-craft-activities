# Accelerate Cancer Education (ACE) High School Summer Research Program

The Accelerate Cancer Education (ACE) program is a 6-week paid summer research experience for high school students interested in biomedical careers. Participants gain hands-on exposure to cancer research, explore a variety of career paths, and engage in activities that highlight The University of Kansas Cancer Center’s commitment to workforce development. Through this immersive program, students experience a comprehensive introduction to the field of cancer research, preparing them for future opportunities in science and healthcare

The ACE summer research program is important because it helps to identify and educate the next generation of the oncology workforce by providing this learning experience to local high school students. This is a timely priority, as cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and according to the National Cancer Institute, the number of new cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 23.6 million globally by 2030.

> **Before this, I had never been in a lab. Working with cancer cells is the coolest thing.** –ACE student

## How to Apply

Applications for the 2026 Summer Program can be submitted [here](https://redcap.kumc.edu/surveys/?s=ALYXYWPRP7MRH4L7).

## Program Details

To achieve the goals of the ACE Program, participants engage in cancer focused programming on-site at KU Cancer Center. Each student is paired with a faculty mentor and assigned a summer research project, which may take place in a laboratory, clinical setting, or office environment. This structure allows students to explore a specific aspect of cancer research in depth. At the end of the program, participants present their research project during a poster forum, showcasing their findings and experiences. Upon successful completion, students receive a $2,940 stipend.  
  
KU Cancer Center is proud to provide this valuable educational opportunity to local high school students, fostering interest in biomedical careers and cancer research.
