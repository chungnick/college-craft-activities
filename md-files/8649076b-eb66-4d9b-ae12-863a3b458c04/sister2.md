# Costs, Financial Aid, and Scholarships

Financial aid—whether in the form of loans, grants, work-study, grants, or scholarships—can be an important part of putting a Penn State degree within reach. Penn State and the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences have numerous resources and ways to help eligible students and their families help pay for a Penn State education. Through the generosity of our alumni and friends, the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences provides financial aid to our students in good academic standing and awards nearly 500 scholarships annually.

[## Costs and Aid](#costs-and-aid-997)

Here are some resources that will let you know more about the costs of college and ways that Penn State students commonly receive student aid.

* [Undergraduate Admissions Costs and Aid](http://admissions.psu.edu/costs-aid/)  
  Information on scholarships, tuition and other costs, financial aid, and eligibility for being considered a Pennsylvania resident.
* [Penn State Office of the Bursar](http://www.bursar.psu.edu)  
  This office maintains student accounts pertaining to tuition billing, acceptance fees, charges, payments, financial aid disbursements, and refunds of excess funds, when available.
* [Penn State Office of Student Aid](https://studentaid.psu.edu/)  
  This office handles requests for federal financial aid. On this site, you can learn about important aid-related policies, different types of assistance such as scholarships, grants, and loans that you may be eligible for, and how to apply for financial aid.

[## Dean's First-Year Scholarship](#dean-s-first-year-scholarship-438)

All students who are offered admission to the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences as first-year students are automatically considered for the Dean’s First-Year Scholarship on the basis of their academic record, without regard to financial need. No applications are required. These awards are offered in the spring prior to enrollment on a funds-available basis.

NOTE: First-Year awards are for the first-year students only.

[## College Scholarships](#college-scholarships-878)

Scholarships for the sophomore through senior years are awarded on the basis of academic excellence. The completion of an online application between January 1 and April 15 is required in order to receive consideration. Because some of these awards are “need-based,” it is important that you submit the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://fafsa.ed.gov/) in a timely manner each year in order to be eligible for support.

Note: Alternative grading might affect your eligibility to receive 2024-2025 Earth and Mineral Sciences Merit Scholarships.

**Deadline:** April 15 annually (Application opens Janauary 1 each year)

* [Undergraduate Scholarship Application](/node/1368)

[## Matthew J. Wilson Loan Fund](#matthew-j--wilson-loan-fund-716)

Low-interest loans are available to entering first-year students as well as upperclassmen and graduate students. Students may borrow up to $1,200 per semester ($2,400 per year) through the fund. Repayment is not required until after graduation. Currently, no interest accrues until graduation. After graduation, the University assesses a 6 percent simple interest rate on these loans. The college, subject to the approval of the University Financial Aid Office, grants these loans. If you have any questions, please visit Ashlee Kochik in the Office of the Dean (513F Eric J. Barron Innovation Hub).

* [Matthew J. Wilson Loan application form](/form/matthew-j-wilson-loan-applicatio)

[## Terry Mohney Emergency Assistance Fund](#terry-mohney-emergency-assistance-fund-508)

Emergency grants are awarded to students who encounter extraordinary events or circumstances that could negatively affect their ability to continue their studies in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Emergency grants are awarded on a case-by-case basis and can be given to a student no more than once per academic year. Limited funding is available.

[## Scholarship Thank You Letters for Donors](#scholarship-thank-you-letters-for-donors-619)

Scholarships are made possible through generous donations. A well-written thank you letter is an important way to acknowledge the funding you have received and gives the donor the opportunity to learn about you.  A short note from you affirms the value and significance of their contributions and encourages their continued support.

We ask that you provide information about yourself to share with your scholarship sponsors by completing the online form.
