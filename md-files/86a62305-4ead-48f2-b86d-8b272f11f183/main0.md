# Plate + Planet Lab

### Monday, July 20 - Friday, August 7, 2026

Barnard’s 3-Week Plate + Planet Lab introduces students to the U.S food system, examining food production, distribution, consumption, and waste management through four key lenses: agriculture; health, policy and justice; food systems and climate change; and soil health.Each week, students will explore farms all across the city and New York state to learn hands-on from farmers growing our food. The program will invite experts and professionals from each unit to guide student's learning experience. Students will take a deep dive into each of these units to imagine a food system that produces food in an ecologically mindful way while supporting our communities and the planet.

## Program Objectives

* **Agriculture:** Students will explore how sustainable farming practices are applied in a real world environment, and have the opportunity to work hands-on at a local farm.
* **Health, policy and justice:**  Students will research and analyze food policies and with a focus on health and wellness, food recovery efforts and food insecurity initiatives in NYC.
* **Food systems and climate change:** Students will evaluate how climate change is putting our food systems at risk and contribution of agriculture to climate change, as well as to climate solutions.
* **Soil Health:** Healthy soil is the foundation of productive, sustainable agriculture. Students will evaluate the three components of soil health which include soil coverage, biodiversity and composting, and soil disturbance.
* **Final project:** The students will get an opportunity to choose a unit of interest and culminate a final project.
