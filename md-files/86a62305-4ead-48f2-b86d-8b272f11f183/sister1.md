### Registration and Tuition Payment

### 

After admission, students have **two weeks** to complete registration in the program registration portal (CampDoc). Registration is required to secure a student’s place in both the program and the selected course. Failure to register within this timeframe will result in the student forfeiting their spot, and programs or courses may fill during this period.

At the time of registration, a **non-refundable deposit equal to 10% of tuition** is required. Families may choose to pay more than the required deposit at registration. The registration portal is accessible 24/7, allowing families to make payments in one or multiple installments until the full tuition balance is due.

The registration portal accepts **ACH and all major credit cards**.

Tuition payments may also be made by check. Once a check is received and processed, the student’s balance will be updated in the registration portal.

Checks must be made payable to **“Barnard College.”** Please include the student’s full name, admitted program, and date of birth on a separate note and mail payment to:

Barnard College  
ATTN: Pre-College Programs  
3009 Broadway  
New York, NY 10027

**Tuition for all programs must be paid in full by May 29, 2026.**

### Need-Based Financial Aid & Application Requirements

### 

Barnard’s Pre-College Programs offer a limited amount of **need-based** financial aid each year.

**International applicants are not eligible to apply for financial aid.**

Students who wish to be considered for financial aid must submit both the Pre-College Program application and the financial aid form by **February 9, 2026**.

The financial aid form is embedded within the program application and becomes available when an applicant indicates their intent to apply for financial aid.

Applicants will then have **two weeks after the February 9 deadline** to upload all required financial aid documentation through their application portal. Financial aid applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, and students are encouraged to apply as early as possible.

| Required Financial Aid Documents |
| --- |
| Financial Aid Form (submitted within the application) |
| 2024 Parent/Guardian Federal Tax Returns |
| 2024 Parent/Guardian W2s |
| Optional statement explaining significant family financial changes in 2025 |

After an applicant is admitted, they will receive a follow-up notification in March indicating whether financial aid has been awarded. Any awarded financial aid will be applied to the student’s tuition balance following registration.
