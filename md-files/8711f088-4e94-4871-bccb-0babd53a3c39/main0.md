## **The SARE Mission**

The Summer Academic Research Experience (SARE) is a high school component of our [Johns Hopkins Initiative for Careers in Science and Medicine](https://csm.cellbio.jhmi.edu/).  SARE seeks to develop exceptional high school students from low-income (<200% of the federal poverty level) and educationally under-resourced (most commonly first-generation college or attends, or would have attended based on their home address, a high school where the majority are also low-income) backgrounds, by introducing them to biomedical research. The students who go through the program are known as “SARE Scholars”.  To date, 95% of our scholars who have reached college age have matriculated into college with nearly 100% receiving partial or full financial support.  SARE also has ≥74% college completion rate by four years post high school graduation.  79% have graduated with degrees in STEM or medical-related majors (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medical-related sciences; STEMM).  These outcomes compare quite favorably to the 10-14% national college completion rate by six years post-college matriculation for students from socioeconomically under-resourced backgrounds.

SARE provides its scholars with a unique exposure to modern scientific research, combined with additional tutoring to fortify academic skills. The rationale is that many low-income youth may not have had the opportunity to be exposed to environments where creative and critical thinking skills are emphasized, where substantial academic accomplishment is celebrated, and where colleagues of all levels are ready to help when one needs it. Laboratories within academic research universities cultivate this type of environment. Therefore, we leverage this environment and utilize our science in outreach to this younger group of students. While research universities already have many outreach programs, most target the undergraduate and post-baccalaureate levels. Through SARE, Johns Hopkins targets adolescents at a critical age in an intensive manner, allowing for substantial impact that will carry on through these students’ lives.

Baltimore is an area of great need. Approximately 34% of children in Baltimore City grow up in poverty, which is nearly three times higher than the national rate (13%). Situated in East Baltimore, SARE provides a conduit for promising, socioeconomically under-resourced students to achieve the academic and professional skills as well as the network needed to succeed.

Please see Program Features to learn about the facets of SARE, including its four pillars: Mentoring, Professionalism, Research, and Academic Fortification.

**Interested in applying?**

**Here is what an unforgettable summer looks like!**

The Summer Academic Research Experience (SARE) Program offers eligible students a rigorous and rewarding summer internship at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine’s East Baltimore Campus. Participants engage in eight weeks of hands-on biomedical research while taking advanced courses in scientific writing, data analysis, mathematics, and bioethics. Through daily engagement, both personally and professionally, students sharpen their critical thinking abilities and practice laboratory techniques alongside mentors in some of the nation’s top research labs. Some SARE scholars have even become co-authors on scientific papers. Upon successful completion of the program, scholars receive a $3000 stipend in recognition of their effort and achievements. Please note that we are unable to provide housing for SARE scholars.

The SARE 2025 program will run from June 23 to August 14, Monday through Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM.

Eligibility requirements:

1. **Scholars must come from households with collective incomes that does not exceed 200% of the federal poverty limit. This amount is normalized by household size. Please see the table in the application for financial eligibility based on family size.**
2. **Scholars must be educationally under-resourced. Scholars most frequently meet this criterion by being first generation college or went to, or would have gone to, a high school where the majority are also low income (a.k.a. Pell grant or Free And Reduced Meals (FARM) eligible). We also consider other extenuating circumstances.**
3. **Scholars must super-motivated to succeed.**

The application portal for Summer, 2025 will open Nov. 1, 2024.

​Nov 21, 2016: Doctoral Diversity Program Scholar Mobolanle Adebesin was just accepted into the Emory University MD-PhD program. Congratulations, Bola!

​Nov 21, 2016: We learned last week that several more of our SARE scholars have returned to school and are now realizing a 1.5 or greater increase in their GPAs as compared to last spring before they came to SARE.

June 21, 2016: We were awarded a grant from the Thomas Wilson Foundation for the Children of Baltimore.  Thank you, TWF!

Aug 17, 2015: We received word today that we were awarded a ~$2M Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).   With this grant, we will now double our number of students at the high school level (to >25 students/yr between SARE and our partnering program BRBT, which is another Hopkins high school program that shares our goals and values).  We will also expand to include undergraduates (~17/yr) from disadvantaged backgrounds as part of the Summer Internship Program (SIP).  We will also create a new program, the Doctoral Diversity Program (DDP), which will provide a 1-year mentored research and career development opportunity to 5 postbaccalaureate students annually.  To accomplish this, we have assembled a wonderful team of Johns Hopkins Faculty and Staff who will help make this happen.  Our overall goal is to establish a pipeline program to prepare students from disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to pursue advanced degrees in medical and STEM fields.  Overall, this is a massive, comprehensive effort in which we will be impacting 48, 52, and 56 students in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.

Jul 30, 2015: Check out Assefa Akinwole’s [CARES Symposium Talk](https://sare.cellbio.jhmi.edu/sare-scholar-assefa-akinwole-cares-talk).

Four more scholars will matriculate into college this fall (2015).  
1. Christopher Miller will attend Allegheny College as a mathematics major and on a full-ride scholarship from the National Science Foundation.  
2. Stephanie Keyaka will attend Penn State, majoring in political science, and will be in the Schreyer Honors Program.  
3. Diana Bobb will major in chemistry or biology at the University of Dayton and received scholarship and grant support from the university.  
4. De’Sean Markley will attend Furman University and major in chemistry or biology.  De’Sean also received considerable financial support.
