**Dartmouth Bound was founded by Gary Love, Class of '76, in 1991 with a cohort of eight African-American students from Kenwood Academy in Chicago. Since its inception, the program has expanded in size and includes students from varied backgrounds from all across the country.**

##### **If you are interested in being notified when the application for the 2026 Dartmouth Bound Program is available, please [fill out this form](https://apply.dartmouth.edu/register/cap-interest-2026).**

As part of its comprehensive outreach efforts, the Dartmouth Bound Program, which takes place in July, is designed to give participants an experience of daily college life at Dartmouth. Participants will learn about Dartmouth's close-knit community and its resources, as well as college admissions and financial aid processes.  
   
The Dartmouth Bound Program application is open to all rising high school seniors currently living and attending a high school in the U.S., regardless of citizenship status. We encourage students from underserved communities—including students who are the first in their families to attend college, students from low-income families, students from rural communities, and students from under-resourced high schools or who otherwise lack access or opportunity to programs or resources that would assist in preparing them for college—to apply. Dartmouth will cover travel expenses, housing, and meals for students who are selected for the program.  
   
Participants will attend workshops on the admissions and financial aid processes and interact with members of our faculty. While staying in Dartmouth residence halls, there will be ample time to enjoy meaningful conversations with current student mentors and other Bound participants. [Read about Chelsea M '26's Dartmouth Bound experience in her recent blog post](https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/follow/blog/chelsea-mills/what-dartmouth-bound#post-content).

##### **Program Highlights**

Admissions officers will explain our individualized review process and provide tips for completing college applications. Participants will have the chance to review sample applications to the College as part of a mock admissions committee exercise. Admissions officers will be available throughout the program to address individual questions about the college application process.  
   
Faculty will describe how their work contributes to the themes of academics, social engagement, and leadership via a class-setting environment. Additionally, professors will show the relevance of undergraduate classes and research to the great issues facing us in the world today.  
   
Participants will tour the campus led by currently enrolled students, which will provide an opportunity to gain orientation of the College and its physical and natural resources while hearing about student experiences.  
   
Need-based financial aid makes a Dartmouth education affordable. During the program, our financial aid officers will provide an overview of the financial aid application process and will address how a family's special circumstances are taken into consideration. Admissions and financial aid staff will help decipher the vocabulary of "need-based aid," "cost of attendance," "work-study" and other terms that will empower participants to make informed financial decisions when choosing a college.  
   
Throughout Dartmouth Bound Program, participants will connect with current students and in the process gain a personal understanding of the Dartmouth experience.  
   
Please note that participation in this program does not result in admission to Dartmouth College.

##### **Read about past participants' experiences with Dartmouth Bound**

> It didn't matter that I didn't get to feel the Hanover breeze, but what did matter was that even through this nightmare of a pandemic, I was still able to feel the love and community that Dartmouth beautifully creates through my Zoom screen. Through Dartmouth Bound, I built a community full of thoughtful and talented individuals, who in the short time that I knew them, became my "quarantine best friends." This program allowed for me to get a true taste of the Dartmouth spirit, and gave me the amazing opportunity to attend compelling class sessions, tour Dartmouth virtually (WHICH WAS THE COOLEST THING EVER!!!), and regroup with our designated Dartmouth Bound Leaders for some honest and open Q&A sessions and debriefs. Honestly speaking, after Dartmouth Bound, I never felt more sure that Dartmouth had to be my next home. **— Anell '25**
>
> In no uncertain words, Dartmouth Bound was the most formative experience in my college application process. It was the opportunity of a lifetime that provided an engaging chance to converse with students from across the country while simultaneously diving into the close-knit Dartmouth Community. As a city kid, one of my favorite experiences was midnight stargazing on the tennis court, it was the point at which I realized Dartmouth was the place for me. I built relationships and maintained friendships with my cohort members far after I left the borders of Hanover. Dartmouth bound welcomed me into a whole new community, one which I genuinely felt I belonged to. In the end I found that Dartmouth was the place for me, regardless of whether you reach that conclusion, you will certainly revere the time you spent at the small but beautiful place called Dartmouth. **— Isaac '27**
>
> To say Dartmouth Bound immensely altered my college view would be an understatement. For the longest, I never understood the concept of a "dream school". The idea that a school could encapsulate someone so much to be equated to a "dream" was confusing as all I ever wanted was to attend some institution, regardless of where or what it was, that allowed me to follow my goals. At Dartmouth, I found a community dedicated to the improvement and forming bonds of togetherness. My Dartmouth Bound group leader showed me compassion I could not have ever expected, spending even months after answering every question I had in the application process. My group members quickly became wonderful friends that I am excited to eventually meet up with once again at Dartmouth next year. In the span of three days, I went from questioning whether I would even apply to Dartmouth to deciding I would apply via Early Decision. A program dedicated to showing the world the wonders of Dartmouth, I am absolutely certain that anyone who attends will adore it. **— Michael '27**
