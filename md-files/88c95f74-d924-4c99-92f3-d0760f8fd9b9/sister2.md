## Funding Outside The Lines

While Dartmouth's financial aid covers 100% of the demonstrated need of all its students, the opportunity for funding doesn't stop there. Dartmouth students have access to resources that make all kinds of experiences possible and ensure that every student can take advantage of the diverse opportunities Dartmouth has to offer. We asked current students to share experiences made possible with Dartmouth's financial support.
