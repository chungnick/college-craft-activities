### the 2025-26 SEASON IS HERE!

# Start a CHALLENGE EXPERIENCE team

## FOLLOW THESE 2 easy steps Below

**Not quite ready to start?**Here are some ways to plan your team.

[PLAN YOUR TEAM](https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/plan-your-team/)

#### Step 1

### Buy a Team Number in our online store

[BUY NOW](https://resources.destinationimagination.org/shop.php/products/product_details/143)

[view our pricing page](/challenge-experience/pricing/)

Your Team Number is a code unique to your team that you’ll use when you register for a tournament. Purchasing your Team Number will give you access to our resources, including the Team Challenges, a set of practice Instant Challenges, and Team Manager training materials.

**The cost of a Team Number is $165 USD.** Teams outside the United States may have different pricing based on their local economies. Visit our [Pricing page](http://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/pricing/) for more details.

*When your order is processed, you will receive further instructions via email.*

#### Step 2

### Find a Team Manager and get their Background Check

[BUY NOW](https://resources.destinationimagination.org/shop.php/products/product_details/2067)

[more info](/challenge-experience/background-checks/)

The Team Manager is the mentor or coach who guides the team through their creative process. Team Managers can be parents, educators, or any volunteer who is at least 18 years old.

Team Managers in the United States must clear a background check before they begin working with their team. You can [purchase a Background Check](https://resources.destinationimagination.org/shop.php/products/product_details/2067) through DI for $25. Schools may purchase these for their Team Managers. *When your order is processed you will receive further instructions via email.*
