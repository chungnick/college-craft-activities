## Mission and Background

The mission of Saturday Academy is to cultivate a representative oral health workforce by empowering high school students through mentorship and hands-on career exploration.

Established in 2012 by **[Dr. Lorel Burns](/nyudental/en/faculty/ft/leb409.html)** and **[Dr. Cheryline Pezzullo](/nyudental/en/faculty/ft/cp1379.html)** — at the time, both second-year students at the College — this preparatory program meets biweekly on Saturdays, 7 sessions per Fall semester, and has introduced 457 high school students to the field of dentistry as a career option. We are happy to report that some of our early Saturday Academy alumni are now dentists.
