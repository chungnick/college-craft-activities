# Summer Research Training Fellowship

* High School Summer Fellowship

2025 SUMMER RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIP FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

The UK College of Medicine Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics is offering a summer research training fellowship to outstanding high school students with a strong interest in science.

This fellowship program is ideal for students who are exploring STEM career options.  By being directly involved in experimentation, students get the chance to see how science concepts they are learning in the classroom are applied to modern research questions.  In the past, some of the fellowship recipients have even continued their research projects either as an independent study for high school credit, as a matriculated UK student in the fall semester, or as summer employment while home from attending an out-of-town college.

See below for more information and application materials.

#### Fellowship Recipients

The fellowship recipient(s) will work under the direct supervision of either a graduate student, post-doctoral fellow, or other research scientist. The student will be expected to read assigned materials to acquire background knowledge in the scientific focus of the lab and will be trained in experimental techniques. Typically, the student is able to perform at least some independent experiments by the end of the fellowship period. The student will also be expected to give a short oral presentation about their research to members of the department at the end of the summer.

Selected student(s) will be given a short list of labs that are open for training this summer and will be allowed to rank their choices, but final placement will be at the discretion of the selection committee.  For more detailed information about faculty members and current research projects in the department, please visit our website: [website](/departments/microbiology).
