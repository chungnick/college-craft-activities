## June 21-26, 2026

JumpstART provides students grades 9-12 with a week of hands-on art instruction led by our university art and graphic design instructors and graduates of our program.

## **Welcome to JumpstART 2026!**

**JumpstART** is a one-week precollege art experience designed for students in grades 9–12 who are interested in developing their creative skills in a supportive, university-level learning environment. The program offers immersive, hands-on instruction in a range of studio disciplines, including drawing, painting, sequential art, graphic design, and photography.

Courses are taught by professional artists and alumni of the JumpstART program, providing students with both technical training and insight into creative careers. Instruction emphasizes skill development, conceptual thinking, and creative exploration, while encouraging students to engage in discussion, ask questions, and receive individualized feedback on their work.

Each day, students enroll in two three-hour studio courses—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—allowing for focused, in-depth learning. The daily schedule includes morning classes from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., a lunch break from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., and a visiting artist lecture at 1:00 p.m. Afternoon studio sessions run from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. Visiting artist talks introduce students to diverse artistic practices and pathways, connecting classroom learning to the broader creative community.

JumpstART offers students a challenging and inspiring opportunity to explore the arts, build confidence in their abilities, and experience what it’s like to study art at a major university.

Brook’s photography blends personal narrative with broader social commentary, exploring themes of identity, resilience, and justice. Whether capturing Alaska's landscapes or documenting human experiences, her work invites reflection on the ties between place, memory, and the forces that shape our shared histories.

**Wednesday, June 25: Kristen Diederich and Kaitlyn Carr (combined talk)**

Image

**Kristen Diederich** (b.1994) is an American painter based in Portland, Oregon. After completing a degree in literature at Portland State University, Diederich’s characteristic abstract painting style emerged during periods of time spent in coastal Maine, Oregon and France. She expresses her empathy for the natural world using varied textures, bold compositions and evocative palettes. Diederich’s paintings greet you chiefly as abstractions –– but you may come to know them as abstract landscapes imbued with real and imaginary symbols that form their visual language, a language of repetition and cinematic depth of field. She has exhibited across Oregon, Maine and Los Angeles, including a solo show last November at Chefas Projects and an upcoming show at Carver Hill Gallery in May.

**Kaitlyn Carr** is a process-based artist exploring multiplicity and modulation. She earned a BFA at Oregon State University (2016) where she developed a deep fascination with the systematic, replicative, and labor-intensive qualities of printmaking. Carr continues to indulge in the obsessive rituals often associated with a print practice while expanding to other media including installation, textiles, drawings, and other works on paper. She has exhibited in multiple group shows up and down the west coast, including the Portland Biennial (2016) and Tryst Alternative Art Fair (2024), and has collaborated with Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), Soliloquy Fine Arts, Street Soccer PDX, and other community organizations to create temporary site-specific installations in Portland – where she currently resides with her two tuxedo cats, Mouse and Moose.

**Thursday, June 26: Ashley Stull-Meyers**
