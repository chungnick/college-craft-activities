The Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program in biotechnology and bioengineering provides undergraduate students the opportunity for cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research in the areas of applied molecular and cellular biology, computational biology, medical devices, bioprocessing, drug discovery and development, as well as business and social science research.

## 2026 Tracks

### Individual Research Projects (IRP) June 15 – July 24

We are offering research opportunities in

1. Biology
2. Computational Biology
3. Engineering (medical devices and bioprocessing)
4. Business / Social Sciences

Please read [this document](/_resources/documents/KGI-SURE2026-IndependentResearchProjects.pdf) for full description of available projects.

For your application, please select the top three projects you are interested in, and in your essay discuss why you are interested in these projects, and what skills (lab, computational, etc.) you possess that would make you a good candidate.

### Science and Business of Drug Discovery (SBDD) July 6 – July 24

In recent decades innovative medicines have helped millions of individuals suffering from once incurable diseases. Many cancers can now be cured or managed, effective treatments now exist for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, and chronic diseases impacting metabolic and cardiovascular health are better managed. However, the development of novel drugs is a costly and failure-prone business, as most investigational treatments fail in clinical trials. Participants within this program will learn about drug discovery from scientific and business perspectives, learning about the process of developing new drugs and how it is managed by a complex web of innovative biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical giants. The three-week program will combine highly interactive classroom sessions with a bio-entrepreneurship project focused on an analysis of an innovative drug development opportunity. Participants will work closely with KGI business and science faculty and, through panels and lunch talks, meet KGI alumni that are working in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.

### Bioprocessing Summer Undergraduate Internship Training and Education (BSUITE) July 6 – July 24

The BSUITE track offers opportunities for undergraduate research in bioprocessing and bioengineering to obtain valuable experience through team projects in bioprocessing for the production of monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, vaccines, and cell and gene therapy.

During this exciting program, participants will learn about technical and regulatory considerations for biopharmaceutical production, including biotechnology and cell line engineering, cell growth, product purification, viral controls, and quality systems. Students will be introduced to career options within biomanufacturing that are enabled through KGI’s Master of Engineering in Biopharmaceutical Processing (MEng) program, including process development, production support, facility engineering, quality oversight, and regulatory positions.

## Who Should Apply

The SURE program is appropriate for motivated undergraduate students majoring in biology, chemistry, engineering, business / social sciences, or related disciplines. One of the program goals is to promote the success of women and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.

## How to Apply

* Personal statement
  + Please provide the following:  
    - Why you are interested in conducting summer research at KGI
    - What your future educational / career goals are
    - Which SURE tracks (IRP, SBDD, BSUITE) you are most interested in and why
      * If your top choice is IRP, please list your top 3 project choices and discuss why you are interested in these projects
      * Placement into your top selected track or project is not guaranteed. We will take your preferences into consideration as we work with faculty to ensure they are available to mentor your research.
    - Describe your relevant skills (lab, computational, etc.) that would make you a good candidate
* Resume
* Letter of recommendation (required for Independent Research Project (IRP) track, optional for other tracks)
  + Contact information for one recommender is required during the online application process. This person should be able to evaluate your qualification and potential for success in our program. You can choose to use a professional or academic reference. Only one recommendation is required but additional recommendations may be submitted if desired. Recommenders will be contacted via email to submit their recommendation online. If they prefer otherwise they can email or mail a copy to the Admissions Office along with this [recommendation form](https://www.kgi.edu/_resources/documents/Letter-of-Recommendation-Form.pdf "Recommendation Form").
* Transcripts
  + Unofficial transcripts may be submitted for evaluation purposes. Official transcripts are not required for admission but may be substituted for unofficial transcripts for admission review.
* English language proficiency (by interview or scores from TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo exam for international students)

Students participating in the in-person program sessions are financially responsible for their transportation, housing, and food throughout the program.
