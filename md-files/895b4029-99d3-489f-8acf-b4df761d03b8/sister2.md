The Lab2Launch program provides undergraduate students the opportunity to experience how scientific discoveries are translated into products that benefit society. The program features one-week online tracks in the biological sciences and in engineering.

## 2026 Tracks

### Session 1 June 15 – June 18

## Drug Discovery (DD)

In this program track you will explore the drug discovery process and mechanism of action of different drugs in the fields of neurology, oncology and others. Students who are interested in medicine and research will learn about drug development and approval processes as well as their relation with different disease states. Activities will involve developing and pitching a new drug molecule, i.e., a made-up drug or compound that is in clinical trials.

## Medical Device Development (MDD)

The medical device development (MDD) track provides an introduction to the medical device industry and product development. Participants will work in teams to explore medical device concepts. The projects will be supported by faculty advisors and daily workshops such as design, manufacturing, and regulatory affairs. It is ideal for engineering students who are exploring industry options; biomedical engineering students wanting business and regulatory context; prospective students selecting graduate programs; and future healthcare professionals who are interested in the design of medical technology.

## Population Health (POPH)

This program track offers an intensive exploration of the rapidly-emerging field of population health, and the challenges to the quality of care provided in the current healthcare system. We will use a range of geographic mapping tools to quantify health disparities, social determinants of health, and other upstream factors linked to poor outcomes. Teams of students will be assigned a particular city and health condition to study. On the final day, teams will present an overview of their adopted community, and a diagnostic workup of the condition, related health problems, social determinants, and relevant community resources. Teams will conclude with innovative ideas to improve the health of their adopted community.

### Session 2 July 6 – July 10

## Biotech Industry Careers (BIC)

This track is designed for students keen on unraveling the multitude of career opportunities in the healthcare and biotechnology sectors. You will collaborate with peers who share your curiosity and zest for discovery. Together, you will delve into foundational concepts spanning business, innovation, and regulatory frameworks, complemented by enriching career mentorship from distinguished faculty and seasoned industry stalwarts. This program is tailored to foster a deep exploration of your personal strengths and aspirations, guiding you toward a career path that not only aligns with your interests but also amplifies your innate potential. Prepare to be inspired, challenged, and transformed as you step closer to finding your niche in the vast ecosystem of healthcare and biotechnology!

## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)

In this program track you will learn how to explore the genetic code using breakthrough technology called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Teams of students will delve into specific NGS applications, focused on personalized cancer treatment, diagnosis of inherited disorders in children and even in a fetus prior to birth, infectious disease diagnosis, and outbreak investigation. NGS has revolutionized not just our fundamental understanding of biology but enabled us to tackle healthcare problems faster and more effectively.

## Who Should Apply

The Lab2Launch program is appropriate for motivated undergraduate students majoring in biology, chemistry, engineering, business / social sciences, or related disciplines.
