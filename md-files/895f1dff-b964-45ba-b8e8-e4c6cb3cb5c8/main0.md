# Botball Educational Robotics

The Botball Educational Robotics Program engages middle and high school students in a hands-on, team-based robotics competition that brings STEM to life. Students design, build, and program autonomous robots — no remote controls here! — using real engineering and coding skills aligned with today’s academic standards.

Botball inspires students through inquiry-based, learn-by-doing experiences that build creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork. By combining technical skill with collaboration, students develop the confidence and leadership needed to thrive in STEM careers.

Each season begins with Botball Educator Workshops in January through March, where teachers and mentors receive training and learn the details of the year’s game challenge. After a seven-week build period, teams head to regional tournaments to showcase their robots and compete for top honors.

##### "Through Botball, students strengthen their understanding of science, technology, engineering, math, and writing — all while having fun tackling real-world challenges."

### [Autonomous Robots](https://www.kipr.org/botball#Autonomous)

In Botball, robots think for themselves — no remote controls here! Students program fully autonomous robots using C, C++, or Java, developing real-world skills in artificial intelligence and embedded systems. Every match is powered by strategy, problem-solving, and pure student ingenuity.

### [Engineering](https://www.kipr.org/botball#Engineering)

No power tools, no machine shop — just creativity and innovation. Every team starts on a level playing field, using the same Botball kit filled with motors, sensors, and building materials to design and engineer a working robot from scratch.

### [Reusable Components](https://www.kipr.org/botball#Reusable)

Botball isn’t just a one-time experience — it’s a year-round learning tool. Most teachers report reusing their controllers, sensors, and motors in classroom projects and after-school programs, extending the value and impact well beyond the competition.

### [Training and Support](https://www.kipr.org/botball#Training)

We don’t just train students — we empower educators. Botball provides workshops, resources, and year-round support to help teachers and mentors confidently integrate robotics into their classrooms and communities. The result? Students inspired for years to come.

**Autonomous No Remote Controlled Robots!**

There’s no driver in Botball — these robots think for themselves! Every move is powered by the students’ own programming and the robot’s sensors, which detect changes in light, distance, color, and other parameters to navigate the game board. Botball robots are fully autonomous, starting, stopping, and maneuvering completely on their own.

By designing, building, and programming their robots, students apply what they learn in the classroom — science, technology, engineering, math, and even language arts — in a hands-on, collaborative project that makes learning meaningful, memorable, and fun.

**Engineering With Minimum Tools**

Every Botball team receives a KIPR Wombat robot controller, LEGO® pieces, compatible metal parts, motors, servos, a variety of sensors, and a camera for computer vision — plus all the tools needed to build a functioning robot, no power tools or machine shop required.

This design keeps the playing field level for all teams, regardless of access to resources.

At the Educator Workshop, teams receive their reusable robotics kit, along with software, documentation, and details for the current season’s game. During the workshop, participants use their kit to build and program a demonstration robot, gaining hands-on experience before competition season begins.

**After the workshop, teams have 7–9 weeks to:**

* 🧠 Design, build, and program two autonomous robots using components from the Botball kit
* 💻 Document their innovation and creativity online through the Team Home Base
* 🌍 Connect and collaborate with students, teachers, roboticists, and hobbyists across the Botball community
* 🏆 Test, refine, and prepare for their regional tournament

## **Reusable Components**

The learning doesn’t stop when the season ends! In a recent survey, 86% of Botball team leaders reported using their Botball kit for educational activities year-round — proving its value far beyond the tournament.

**Creative ways to use your Botball kit outside the season:**

* 🧪 Integrate into the classroom — bring robotics into physics, technology, or computer science lessons
* ⚙️ Enhance existing activities — use sensors, motors, or components for hands-on lessons like simple machines or data collection projects
* 🚀 Host a fall mini-challenge — get students energized and ready for the upcoming Botball season
* 🔧 Encourage independent exploration — let students use the kit for science fairs, engineering projects, or personal innovation

## **Training and Support**

Teachers who are confident using robotics to teach STEM can inspire and impact students for years to come. That’s why every Botball region hosts a hands-on professional development workshop designed and led by professional roboticists.

These workshops empower educators to guide students through the engineering design process while strengthening computational thinking and coding skills. The Botball curriculum aligns with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core Math Standards, giving teachers a structured, flexible framework for classroom success.

After the workshop, the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics continues to provide technical support and mentorship throughout the Botball season — ensuring teachers and teams have the tools they need to thrive.
