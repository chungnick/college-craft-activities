# New York Bioforce

#### Free Comprehensive Science Research Training Leading to Paid Summer Internships in Research Labs and Health Care Institutions

April 4 - August 14, 2026

Thank you for your interest in New York Bioforce! This program is designed for students graduating in 2026 or 2027 from low-resource backgrounds who would most benefit from increased opportunity in STEAM fields. It provides 50 hours of science research and professional skills training on Saturdays in the spring followed by placement in a six-week paid summer internship at cutting-edge academic and industry labs and health care institutions.

​

We've placed students at Columbia Engineering, Weill Cornell Medicine, the New York Cancer and Blood Specialists, and life science companies. This program prepares participants for higher education in STEAM fields and ultimately to join the workforce as the next generation of scientists and health care professionals.

## Applications for 2026 are open now!
