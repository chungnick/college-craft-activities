# Research Intensives

Our competitive six-week summer Research Intensives program places high-achieving high school students in professional working labs alongside distinguished faculty, graduate and undergraduate students. We offer placements in Biology, Biochemistry, Engineering, Psychology and Food Science.

Students eligible to apply should have grades of B or above in mathematics and science courses. Applicants should indicate their top three lab choices and reason for interest in the personal statement portion of the application.

Research Intensives are part of our Residential Pre-College Programs, and take place at the UMass Amherst campus. Residential programs at UMass combine all the major elements of college, including great academics, living in a residence hall, and eating in our award-winning dining commons. Of course, it takes a little help to adjust to life on a college campus, so we have live-in resident counselors who are specially trained to help you get used to a new environment. We have lots of fun events in the evenings and on weekends that help you connect with other pre-college students.

Summer 2026 program offerings will be posted in December. In the meantime, check out our Summer 2025 program details below.
