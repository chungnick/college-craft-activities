## about the internship

The Anita K. Hersh Jewish Summer Teen Internship is a selective, four-week program in which rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors join a diverse group of socially conscious Jewish peers to build vital connections with older adults age 65+.

Teens interact with older adults in a variety of  meaningful programs that are uniquely designed to engage intergenerational groups. Together, you’ll explore Jewish communal responsibility and wisdom through daily workshops, volunteering, and activities that include home visits, tech assistance for seniors, creative arts, and discussion groups. Both teens and older adults contribute to building friendships and a community that enrich each other’s lives.

Our internship is a life-changing experience in which you can give back to your community while earning over 100 service hours.

### Build Leadership Skills

Interns receive extensive training and cohort development from our professional team and build leadership skills by planning, facilitating, and participating in daily experiences designed to bridge the generation gap and build life-changing social connections.

The Jewish Summer Teen Internship program is limited to 20 – 22 teens per summer. Summer interns are also expected to volunteer for at least 15 hours with DOROT during the academic year following the summer program.

#### What You’ll Do

The first day includes an orientation and training, and each week is guided by a Jewish theme. We begin the week with group building games and leadership training. Interns end each week with group reflection.

Each intern will have their own schedule of workshops and visits with older adults that may include:

* Designing and running intergenerational activities
* Visiting with DOROT older adults in their homes.
* Exploring social justice and Jewish communal connections through volunteering.
* Leading weekly Jewish discussion groups with older adults.
* Participating in art-based projects including crafts, music, and cooking.
* Teaching older adults how to use technology.
* Leading and planning special events.
* Playing chess, Scrabble, and other games with older adults
