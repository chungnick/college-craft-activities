## A Life-Changing Summer

DOROT’s Summer Teen Internship is a selective, four-week program for rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Interns join a diverse group of socially conscious peers to build vital social connections with older adults. **Our internship is a life-changing experience in which you can give back to your community while earning over 100 service hours.**

As an intern, you will develop exceptional leadership skills and participate in meaningful activities designed to bridge the generational divide. These include visiting older adults at home, providing technology assistance, sharing ideas in discussion groups, taking part in creative arts workshops, and much more.  Summer interns also volunteer for at least 15 hours with DOROT during the academic year following the summer program.

### Frequently Asked Questions

What expenses are associated with the program?

There is no charge to intern with DOROT. If you are in need of assistance in paying for travel expenses, we can help.

Is there anything I should know about the application process?

We typically receive over 300 applications. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis beginning in December and ending in April, but students are encouraged to apply early, as positions will likely fill prior to the final deadline. While DOROT runs two internship sessions per summer, interns may only participate in one each summer. Applicants select a session preference on the application form. All applicants are required to participate in a group interview.

What if I can’t commit to the whole internship?

Space in the internship is very limited. We require interns to commit to the full four weeks, Monday – Thursday, 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM, as well as a closing event on the final evening. Attendance is only excused for school exams and emergencies. Note: Summer Interns are expected to also volunteer for at least 15 hours with DOROT during the academic year following the summer program.

Do I need to bring anything?

Students who are invited to participate as interns and accept the position must have access to a computer, smartphone, or tablet with WIFI connectivity and video capability. DOROT will provide program supplies and materials.
