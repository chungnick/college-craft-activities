UC Irvine’s Summer Surgery Program was established in 2012 and has continued to evolve into one of the most premier medical based high school summer programs offered. Since the program’s inception, the team has worked with feedback from our summer surgeons to continually innovate and improve the program.

The Summer Surgery Program inspires and empowers highly motivated, high-performing high school students to pursue their interest in medicine or related fields via intense real-life exposure to the world of surgery.

Throughout the entire program summer surgeons regularly interact with team members representing all levels of training to assure they fully understand entire process of becoming a surgeon.

* Pre-med students
* Medical students
* Surgical residents
* Surgical fellows
* Junior faculty
* Senior faculty

With their mentorship, summer surgeons gain clear insight into the daily life, aspirations, challenges, and motivations of health professionals. Along with hands-on exposure and training on the worlds most advanced surgical technology, summer surgeons are welcomed into UCI operating rooms to observe live surgery, where they identify real-life challenges experienced by surgical teams.

Inspiring technical wonder summer surgeons create unique novel innovative solutions and present these innovations to a judging panel composed of world-class leaders in technology.
