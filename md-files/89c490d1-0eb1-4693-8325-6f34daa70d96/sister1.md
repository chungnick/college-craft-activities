# Sequencing Your Genome Camp for High School Students:

# ***Your Genome, in Your Hands***

## **College students are also welcome**

### **New for 2026 SYG camps:** students will use machine learning packages to predict their ABO blood types thanks to the aggregated data anonymously shared by previous campers. If you are wish, you may also contribute to this ongoing project involving sequencing and AI in medicine.

Individuals typically don’t understand their own genomic data despite its vital importance to the health of themselves and their families. A person’s genome is vast and difficult to analyze without appropriate tools and training.

Currently, if one does seek genome sequencing, their sequencing data is owned and analyzed by the sequencing company. It is common practice for companies to also sell this genetic data to others. We at miRcore want to provide individuals the option of owning their genomic data. This means that miRcore will have no access to the data.

This camp is to start that journey. Please join us in this exciting endeavor.

With your help, we would like to build a gene-literate citizenry. Students will learn to do real disease research in module 1, explore next generation sequencing technology and data in module 2, and then analyze their own sequenced genome to learn how to research it in module 3. All our sessions use tools and databases in current widespread use by scientists.

If you wish to continue doing self-data research after the camp, we will support you as needed.

The [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE)](https://micde.umich.edu/) has provided access to the University of Michigan’s high performance computing [Great Lakes Slurm cluster](https://arc-ts.umich.edu/greatlakes/) for all Your Genome campers to run calculations in a Linux environment (more computing resources than for other camps over an extended period).

**Session (Modules 1 + 2 + 3):**

**Module 1.**  Computational Biology Camp Content (in-person highly recommended); one of the following:

June 15 – June 19, 2026 (Mon-Fri), Time: 10 am – 5 pm (Eastern Time), University of Michigan campus

July 6 – July 10, 2026 (Mon-Fri), Time: 10 am – 5 pm (Eastern Time), University of Michigan campus

July 27 – July 31, 2026 (Mon-Fri), Time: 9 am – 4 pm (Pacific Time), Scripps campus

\*For Virtual CB camps, arrangements must be made in advance prior to meetings needed.

**Module 2.**  Biotechnology Sequencing Camp Content

July 13 – 17, 2026 (Mon-Fri), Time: 10 am – 5 pm (Eastern Time) hybrid format, either on University of Michigan Campus, Ann Arbor, MI or virtual

**Module 3.** Analyzing Your Genome In Your Hands

August 3 – 7, 2026 (Mon-Fri), Time: 9 am – 4 pm (Pacific Time) hybrid format, either on Scripps Research Institute Campus, La Jalla, CA or virtual

Deadline: April 30, 2026 (rolling basis)

**INTENDED AUDIENCE:**Academically motivated current (2025-26) high schoolers 16 and older interested in computers, math, science, and medicine. College students interested in computational genomics research.

**REQUIRED:** 16+ years old on the first day of the Module 3 session. We need signed acknowledgement that the DNA they are submitting for sequencing must be their own, is strictly for self-data analysis, and is only for non-medical research purposes.

**PREREQUISITE:** High school biology class

**TUITION**:

A) Sequencing Your Genome (SYG) camp: $3,650 (including one-year [miRcore student membership](https://www.mircore.org/for-high-school-students/membership/), $300 value)

B) Students who took CB camp previous years – option to take 2nd and 3rd modules of SYG camp: $2,775 (including one-year [miRcore student membership](https://www.mircore.org/for-high-school-students/membership/), $300 value)

Students will receive a **$80 discount** if they take the advanced CB camp in addition to SYG camp.

*A computer with internet connection is required to join the online camp.*

**APPLICATION FEE:** $75

## Student responses after 2023 SYG camp

> Learning about genetics at camp was the best summer experience ever!
>
> I learned that genes can tell us so much about our past, present, and future.
>
> I want to be part of future research. It’s like being a detective, but for genes!
>
> I want to do more camps next summer!
>
> I want to contribute to our collective research by sharing my data anonymously
