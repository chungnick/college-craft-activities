# Summer Programs FAQ

# Summer Programs FAQ

General program

[Do I earn college credit?](#collapse-accordion-527-1)

Only students attending the Pre-College Programs earn college credit and a corresponding University of Pennsylvania transcript. Students in the Summer Academies and Online Seminars earn a certificate of completion and do not receive an official University transcript.

[Are summer high school program alumni favored for admission to Penn as undergraduates?](#collapse-accordion-546-1)

Admission to Penn SAS High School Programs does not guarantee admission to a Penn undergraduate program. Admission to Penn is highly competitive and based upon a variety of factors. Penn SAS High School Programs are a great addition to any resume and, combined with a strong high school record, will provide undergraduate admissions officers with information regarding your academic potential.

[How do I get transcripts or my certificate of completion?](#collapse-accordion-650-1)

Summer Academy and Online Seminars students can contact the Penn SAS High School Programs office for a digital copy of their Certificate of Completion. Pre-College Programs students can access their transcript through Path@Penn.

[Can recent high school graduates enroll in Penn SAS High School Programs?](#collapse-accordion-693-1)

Graduating high school seniors are not eligible for Penn SAS High School Programs but may apply for [Penn Summer Sessions](https://summer.sas.upenn.edu/programs/penn-summer-sessions). To enroll, students must be able to submit their diploma at the time of application. Note that this will likely happen after the start of Summer 11-Week and Summer Session I classes. As a result, it’s likely that only Summer Sessions II courses will be available to recent high school graduates. These students should also contact the advising office of their prospective undergraduate institution to discuss their decision to enroll in Penn summer classes as their university/college may not accept pre-freshman credit and may have restrictions on coursework taken prior to matriculating. Penn Summer cannot guarantee transfer credit and students must confirm with their college advisors prior to enrollment as a visiting student. If you have been admitted to the University of Pennsylvania as an undergraduate, please check [the Penn Summer Sessions enrollment page](https://summer.sas.upenn.edu/programs/summer-sessions/enrollment) for specific information for summer registration.

[Is participating in the residential and online programs for the same session possible?](#collapse-accordion-1088-1)

Students can register for an online program in Session 1 and return for Session 2 either in-person or online for Session 2. However, students cannot enroll in two programs in the same session.

[What is Penn’s relationship with Summer Discovery?](#collapse-accordion-543-1)

Penn SAS High School Programs has collaborated with [Summer Discovery](https://www.summerdiscovery.com/campuses/university-of-pennsylvania-school-of-art-and-science) for over 10 years. Summer Discovery oversees all community-building aspects of the summer programming, including residential supervision, student evening and weekend activities, and ensures the health and safety of all students throughout while participating in Penn’s programs. The University of Pennsylvania manages all academic programming, including the application process, advising, and course enrollment. While the Penn SAS High School Programs office and Summer Discovery are experts in different areas of summer programming, we work together as a cohesive team to provide the best possible summer experience for each student.

[Can I do an internship, participate in research, hold a summer job, or participate in another summer program at Penn or another university?](#collapse-accordion-595-1)

No. Due to the intensive, residential nature of our programs, residential students are prohibited from engaging in research, an internship, holding summer employment, or participating in another summer program at the University of Pennsylvania or another university program while you are participating in a summer high School program.

For students in online summer programs, you are encouraged to devote your full attention to the program to make the most of the experience, but you are in charge of your own time management.

[If I have questions, who should I contact?](#collapse-accordion-539-1)

You should reach out to the Penn SAS High School Programs office at [hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu) if you have questions regarding:

* General inquiries
* Admissions
* Applications
* Courses
* Registration
* Billing

You should reach out to Summer Discovery at [penn@summerdiscovery.com](mailto:penn@summerdiscovery.com) if you have questions regarding:

* General inquiries
* Billing of additional fees such as airport pick-up or international health insurance
* Residential experience
* Weekend and evening activities and events
* Health and well-being
* Professional residential summer employment opportunities

[What can students do outside of class?](#collapse-accordion-1079-1)

Residential students have access to the residence hall, lounges, gym, dining halls, and libraries when classes are not in session. In general, students will be studying or working on assignments outside of class when they are not making friends or participating in the planned activities. The Summer Discovery residential staff will plan engaging daily activities for all students to enjoy, such as trivia or arts and crafts nights during the week and weekend field trips off campus to the beach or a Phillies game, for example.

[What happens if I need physical or academic accommodations?](#collapse-accordion-1283-1)

Penn will make efforts to accommodate all reasonable requests with appropriate documentation. For more information, please email us at [hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu).

Application

[What are the application deadlines for summer programs?](#collapse-accordion-653-1)

Application dates are available on the [Application Information page](https://hs.sas.upenn.edu/summer-programs/application-information).

[Can I apply for more than one program?](#collapse-accordion-592-1)

Yes! You can apply to as many programs as you would like. Each program requires its own application and has a separate $100 application fee.

[If I am accepted, what do I have to do to hold my place?](#collapse-accordion-568-1)

Confirming your enrollment to your academic program of choice via the application portal **AND** paying the non-refundable $1,500 financial deposit is the only way to formally reserve your spot within the program. Seats for programs are held on a first-come, first-served basis.

[What are the requirements to apply?](#collapse-accordion-533-1)

Penn SAS High School Programs summer applicants must have excellent writing skills and a minimum 3.5 high school GPA. To apply, you must complete the online application, which includes one or more essays and a letter of recommendation. Standardized test scores are not required for any program but are strongly encouraged for Pre-College Programs applicants. Non-native English speakers must submit a test score to verify English language proficiency unless they attend an English medium school, in which case the requirement is waived. If scores are required, TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo English Test (DET) scores are accepted. Students must have attended an English-medium school for two+ years by the time of enrollment for the requirement to be waived. There is a non-refundable application fee of $100. For more details and program-specific requirements, visit the [Application Information page](https://summer.sas.upenn.edu/programs/high-school/application).

[When will I be notified of an admissions decision?](#collapse-accordion-560-1)

Our program operates on a rolling until full admissions process. Only completed applications are reviewed as they are received. It is an applicant’s responsibility to make sure that their application is complete. It may take up to six weeks for an applicant to receive an admissions decision on a completed application.

[What is the minimum age required to be eligible to apply for the residential program?](#collapse-accordion-1082-1)

Students applying to our residential programs must be at least 13 years of age to be able to live in the University residential halls. Students must be 15 years of age to have gym access.

[How can I send a reminder to my recommender or submit a request for a new recommender after submitting my application?](#collapse-accordion-1108-1)

To resend notification emails to your recommenders, revisit the recommendations page of the application, select the reference's name, and then click "Send Reminder."

To send a notification email to a new recommender, revisit the recommendations page of the application, click "Add Reference," enter their contact information, and then click "Send Reminder."

Tuition & Fees

[What are the tuition and fees, and what does that include?](#collapse-accordion-623-1)

Tuition and fee information for each program is available on our [Tuition and Fees page](https://hs.sas.upenn.edu/summer-programs/tuition). Tuition is inclusive of full academic and term fees, use of Penn academic facilities, on-campus housing, meal plan, extracurricular activities and trips, and student supervision, a rental linen packet, and membership to the campus gym (ages 15+ only). Online students do not have access to on-campus amenities.

[Can I use my tuition benefits for my child if I am a University of Pennsylvania employee?](#collapse-accordion-635-1)

Tuition benefits do not apply to high school summer programs, but there are some [scholarships available](https://hs.sas.upenn.edu/summer-programs/tuition/scholarship) to students who attend a School District of Philadelphia public or charter high school.

[What does the residential program fee include?](#collapse-accordion-1085-1)

The on-campus program fees include Penn academic facilities, on-campus housing, gym access, linens, meal plans, extracurricular activities and trips, and student supervision.

[Is financial aid available or can I apply for a scholarship?](#collapse-accordion-628-1)

Financial aid is not available for our programs. You can use 529 college savings plan accounts to pay for the programs, but high school students participating in our programs are non-degree seeking and do not qualify for traditional financial aid through FAFSA.

A limited number of [scholarships](https://hs.sas.upenn.edu/summer-programs/tuition/scholarship) are provided to select students from the School District of Philadelphia for the Summer Academies. All other students requiring financial assistance to attend a summer program are encouraged to seek external sources of funding from educational agencies or scholarship groups. No scholarships are available for the Pre-College Programs.

[When will I be able to pay my remaining tuition balance?](#collapse-accordion-632-1)

Tuition information will be available after course registration begins in March. Tuition and program fees can be paid online via electronic check, credit card, or wire via [PennPay](https://srfs.upenn.edu/billing-payment/pennpay) using your PennKey.

[Is it possible to transfer the $1,500 nonrefundable deposit from one program to another?](#collapse-accordion-1096-1)

No, the $1,500 nonrefundable deposit, the offer of admission, and the application materials are non-transferable to any other University of Pennsylvania programs.

[How do I pay the $1,500 non-refundable deposit?](#collapse-accordion-1104-1)

To submit your deposit, log back into the application portal. You’ll find the payment link next to the “Enrollment Deposit” item on your checklist.

International students

[Do I need a visa to participate in summer programs?](#collapse-accordion-618-1)

No visa is needed for any program if the program is running entirely online. The University advises against a B-1/B-2 visa or visa waiver (ESTA) for online Pre-College Programs students. An F-1 student visa is required only for residential Pre-College Programs. The Summer Academies are taken on a non-credit basis and are therefore ineligible for student visa sponsorship through the University. International students wishing to enroll in these programs must secure the necessary tourist or B-2 visa from their home country. Pre-College Programs students can [contact the Penn International Student and Scholar Services office](https://global.upenn.edu/isss) (ISSS) with specific visa-related questions.

[Do I need to submit an English proficiency exam?](#collapse-accordion-612-1)

Non-native English speakers must submit a test score to verify English language proficiency unless they attend an English medium school, in which case the requirement is waived. Students must have attended an English-medium school for two+ years by the time of enrollment for the requirement to be waived. If scores are required, TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo English Test (DET) scores are accepted. See the [Application Information page](https://hs.sas.upenn.edu/summer-programs/application-information) for more details.

Pre-College Programs

[What if a course is full?](#collapse-accordion-601-1)

New Pre-College Programs courses may open during the add/drop period, but additional space cannot be created in a closed course. A waitlist is **NOT** maintained for Pre-College Programs courses as registration is based on a first-come, first-served system and undergraduates as visiting students are also registering for these same courses. Please contact the Penn SAS High School Programs office at [hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:hsprogs@sas.upenn.edu) for the most up-to-date information about course status.

[What is academic credit?](#collapse-accordion-1021-1)

Academic credit is defined by the University of Pennsylvania as a course unit (c.u.). A course unit (c.u.) is a general measure of academic work over a period of time, typically a term (semester or summer). A c.u. (or a fraction of a c.u.) represents different types of academic work across different types of academic programs and is the basic unit of progress toward a degree. One c.u. is usually converted to a four-semester-hour course.

[Can I apply for one specific course in the Pre-College Programs?](#collapse-accordion-665-1)

Students apply to the program, not to one specific course. You are required to choose alternate courses when registering as courses may be at capacity or be canceled.

Summer Academies

[How and when do I enroll in my academy?](#collapse-accordion-672-1)

There is no course selection process for Summer Academy students. Once you have accepted your admissions decision and submitted your non-refundable deposit, you are considered enrolled in your academy.

[What if an academy is closed?](#collapse-accordion-678-1)

Waitlists are maintained for Summer Academies. If a space opens in an academy, it will go to the next student on the waitlist. We do not release a student's position on the waitlist.
