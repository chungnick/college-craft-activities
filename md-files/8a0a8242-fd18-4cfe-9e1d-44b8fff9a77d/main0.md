* [Summer Before Colgate](/academics/scholars-programs/ous-undergraduate-scholars/summer-colgate)

From mid-July to mid-August, OUS students live on campus and participate in two academic courses taught by Colgate faculty, with an emphasis on critical reading, analytical writing, and quantitative literacy skills. Courses in the Summer Institute are intensive and on a shortened schedule; they range from the core curriculum to biology to anthropology.

We recognize that not all incoming students have equal access to resources while they are in high school. The Summer Institute strengthens OUS scholars' academic skills by immersing them in the rigorous academic culture of Colgate University.

The Summer Institute also offers a place for students to build a home before their first semester starts. They can begin to build close relationships with faculty, staff, and fellow OUS scholars and are introduced to a wealth of campus resources through the office of the Dean of the Faculty and the Dean of the College.

When I arrive on campus, where do I go?

For students and families coming to campus by car, signs will direct traffic to the upper campus parking lots near 100 Hamilton Street. Personal cars are not allowed on campus during the five-week session.

For those arriving in Utica or Syracuse by bus, train, or plane, we will provide shuttle services to campus. We will send a questionnaire regarding travel plans prior to the program. We urge students and their families to complete the questionnaire, even if arriving by car, so that we can plan accordingly for everyone's arrival.

Where will I be living?

100 Hamilton Street ([campus map](https://map.colgate.edu/?id=148#!ct/85190,61712?m/620725?s/100%20h)) is the summer residence for all OUS scholars in the Summer Institute. The Summer Institute's Community Facilitators (CFs) and Academic Mentors (AMs) will also reside there.

OUS scholars will not live in 100 Hamilton Street for the new academic year.  New housing assignments will be available on August 1, 2025. We will assist everyone with moving into their new rooms at the end of the Summer Institute.

What should I pack?

OUS scholars should plan on bringing casual clothing, as well as one or two dressier outfits for special activities. The weather is generally moderate during the summer, but it can get cool during the evenings and early mornings while rising to quite warm temperatures during the day.

We cover the cost of tuition, books, supplies, fees for co-curricular activities, room, and most meals during the Summer Institute. Bring some pocket money for any other personal expenses.

Note about linens for the Summer Institute: We will provide a set of university-rented linens consisting of a pillowcase, two sheets (including a fitted sheet), two towels, and two washcloths for the duration of the Summer Institute. The OUS scholars are responsible for laundering these items. Washers and dryers are available in the Pinchin Hall residence at a cost of $1.80 per load, wash, or dry. OUS scholars are responsible for providing their own pillow, mattress pad, and comforter.

This is a list of suggested items OUS scholars should consider bringing as well:

**For the closet:**

* Jacket/sweater
* Bathing suit
* Casual clothing (shorts, jeans, sweats, etc.)
* Comfortable shoes (sneakers, flats, etc.)
* Hangers
* Pajamas
* Robe
* Socks/underwear
* Two or three business casual outfits (blouses/dress shirts, pants, tie, dress/skirt, dress shoes)
* Umbrella

**For the bathroom:**

* "Shower bucket" (for carrying supplies to and from shower)
* Bathrobe
* Brush/comb
* Contact lens supplies/glasses
* Deodorant
* First-aid supplies
* Hair dryer
* Toiletries
* Shampoo/conditioner
* Shaving supplies
* Shower shoes (flip-flops)
* Soap
* Toothbrush/toothpaste
* Hair care products (perms, grease, pink lotion, etc.)

**For the bedroom:**

* Alarm clock
* Blanket/comforter
* Book bag/backpack
* Desk lamp
* Fan
* Laundry supplies (bag/basket, detergent, dryer sheets)
* Mini refrigerator (optional)
* Pillow
* Comforter
* Small microwave
* Throw blanket

What should I do about medical insurance coverage?

For 2025-2026, the cost for the annual student health insurance policy offered through the university provider is $1,990 (this is reflected on the fall semester billing notification). If you are covered by your parent/guardian’s medical insurance, and their insurance coverage is comparable to the policy provided by Colgate, you may waive the Colgate coverage. However, you must visit the [main Colgate student health insurance page](https://www.colgate.edu/student-life/health-safety-wellness/student-health-services/required-health-insurance) to enroll actively in or waive the Colgate student health insurance coverage by June 14, 2025. [Please note: this deadline is much earlier than is required by the University, which is August 1, 2025. We want to make sure that you have a compatible insurance package from your home coverage prior to starting the Summer Institute.  If you do not, you will need to enroll in the Colgate student health insurance plan.] You should receive additional information about Colgate's student health insurance program in the mail as well.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to OUS with your questions and concerns.

Will my cell phone work in Hamilton?

The more reliable cell phone service providers with coverage in the area are AT&T and Verizon.

May I return home or have visitors during free time and weekends?

OUS scholars are expected to be in attendance for the entire five weeks. We have planned several social and recreational activities and outings for community building. We ask that OUS scholars not plan to go home, visit family/friends, or have visitors during this time.

At the end of the Summer Institute, students wishing to stay on campus can do so; otherwise, they can go home and return to campus on Sunday, August 24, 2025, for the First Year Student Arrival Day. For those who will be on campus during this ten-day gap period, we will have different social activities for them. They can also participate in pre-orientation activities, including Wilderness Adventure, offered by the university.
