## The Colgate Commitment

This financial aid initiative makes a Colgate education within reach for the best and brightest students from all economic backgrounds. For eligible domestic students, this comprehensive financial aid initiative adjusts tuition based on the family’s income levels and significantly reduces student debt.

[More about the Colgate Commitment](/admission-aid/financial-aid/colgate-commitment "The Colgate Commitment")

## Estimate Your Aid

Domestic students may use Colgate’s cost calculators to determine an estimate of their financial aid range and their family's contribution.

[Estimate your cost](/admission-aid/financial-aid/estimate-your-aid "Estimate Your Aid ")

## Apply for Aid

Prospective students will be considered for Colgate’s need-based aid only when they apply for financial aid before an admission decision is made. Current students holding U.S. citizenship or permanent residency receiving financial aid must reapply annually.
