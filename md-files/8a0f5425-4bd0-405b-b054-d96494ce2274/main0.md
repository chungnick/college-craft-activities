* Actuarial Science Camp

Our Actuarial Science Summer Camps are week-long intensive programs for rising high school seniors designed to help them decide if they’re interested in actuarial careers. LVC has had a successful Actuarial Science Program for more than 50 years, and we’ve run this summer camp for more than three decades. Leveraging industry connections and alumni suggestions, we’ve forged an authentic experience that features interaction with actuaries and an introduction to relevant software and content.

**In the summer of 2026, we will have two one-week long camps:**

* **June 21–26, 2026**
* **July 5–10, 2026**

To apply to the summer camp, fill out the application form using the Apply button below. A letter of recommendation is also required. The letter should be no more than one page and be from a high school teacher familiar with your work in mathematics. The letter of recommendation must be emailed to Dr. Patrick Brewer at [brewer@lvc.edu](mailto:brewer@lvc.edu).

### FAQs

Who should I contact if I have questions about the camp?

Patrick Brewer, [brewer@lvc.edu](mailto:brewer@lvc.edu)

What is the camp fee?

The camp fee for summer 2026 is $950, and it covers all camp-related expenses, including room and board.

Who is eligible to attend the Actuarial Science Camp?

Students who have completed three years of high school are eligible for the program, but graduates are not.

When is the registration deadline?

There is no formal registration deadline, but when the program is full registration will be closed. Because the number of spaces is limited (to facilitate closer collaborations between students, faculty, and guest speakers), it is advised that registrations and payments be submitted as soon as possible to secure a slot.

When and how will I be notified if I have been accepted to camp?

Once we receive your camp payment, Health Information Form and Waiver Form, you will be automatically added to our roster of enrolled students! Additional details about the program, including a detailed schedule, will be sent to all enrolled students prior to the start of camp.

What is the camp schedule?

[View a sample camp schedule here.](/about/camps-community-programming/actuarial-science-camp/schedule/)

When will I arrive and depart from camp?

* Check in: 2 p.m. Sunday (June 21 or July 5)
* Check out: 12 p.m. Friday (June 26 or July 10)

What do I bring to camp?

Students should bring linens and a blanket (for a twin bed), a pillow, towels, toiletries, clothes, etc. Computer access will be provided for all camp activities; however, students are welcome to bring their own laptop or tablet to use in class or in the dorm (a Wi-Fi access code will be distributed). Although all meals will be provided, campers may wish to bring snacks and/or drinks to keep in their dorm room. The cost of all activities, classes, and meals is included with camp tuition, but campers may wish to bring money with them for bookstore purchases or souvenirs.

Who will be supervising campers in the dormitories? Will the campers be safe?

Campers will live in a college residence hall with Camp Counselors. Camp Counselors are current actuarial science majors at Lebanon Valley College who have been selected by the Camp Director. The dormitory will be locked at all times, Lebanon Valley College campus safety officers are on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week, and the Camp Director may be contacted at any time by camp counselors.

What will happen in case of an emergency?

Parents/guardians will be contacted in case of any injury or illness to their child. In emergency situations, the safe transport of campers to the nearest hospital will be ensured.

## In Their Words

Job Preparation

The camp convinced me that I would find actuarial science interesting and that LVC had a strong program that would lead me to job opportunities. While there is a heavy math requirement in becoming an actuary, and it is easy to get wrapped up in the math course work, other skills like communication and programming are what will set you apart and get you a job. One of the most important skills to have is the ability to present complex information in a straightforward and engaging way.

Practical Experience

The camp gave me a much better idea about what an actuary actually does on a day-to-day basis and the subjects I would be learning in school. I liked how the camp was structured and that I was encouraged to think for myself rather than just ask questions right away. Being an actuary is not for everyone, and if you’re not willing to put in the work, you’re not going to succeed. But the reward is certainly worth the effort.
