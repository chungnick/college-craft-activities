\**To apply complete the form below and click Submit button at the bottom. Then, arrange to have a letter of recommendation (at most one page) sent to Dr. Patrick Brewer, at brewer@lvc.edu. The letter should come from a high school teacher who is familiar with your work in mathematics. You should apply as soon as possible because there are a limited number of spaces available, and applications are reviewed as they are received. The essay portion of the application is used to determine admission and to help shape the week's curricula and activities, so please be clear and specific.*
