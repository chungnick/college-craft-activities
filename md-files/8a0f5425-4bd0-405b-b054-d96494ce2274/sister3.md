## Submitting Financial Aid Documents

Financial Aid required documents may be uploaded through a secure link in MyLVC. Simply click MyInfo for Students in the portal and select the “MyInfo / Financial Aid Document Upload” button.

## Financial Aid 101

Applying for Financial Aid is a key step in your college journey, but we understand it can sometimes feel overwhelming. To help ensure your application process goes smoothly, we’ve put together a helpful list of key terms and essential information to make the most of your financial aid offer.

FAFSA

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid allows students a streamlined process to apply for federal loans and grants. LVC encourages all families to complete a FAFSA to maximize their financial aid offer. The FAFSA is completed annually and becomes available October 1 for the following academic year. You can complete the FAFSA at [studentaid.gov](https://www.studentaid.gov).

If you are not planning to file a FAFSA within any academic year and have not already notified us, please email [**finaid@lvc.edu**](mailto:finaid@lvc.edu?subject=) and we will prepare a financial aid offer for you.

Cost of Attendance (COA)

The total cost of attending a college includes both direct and indirect expenses. Direct costs are charges billed by the school, such as tuition, housing, food, and required fees. Indirect costs are estimated expenses you may have, such as books, personal items, and transportation.

Student Aid Index (SAI)

A number calculated from the FAFSA that college’s use to determine a student’s eligibility for federal financial aid.

Financial Need

The gap between college costs and what your family can afford. This is what helps decide your financial aid – not just your income. The Cost of Attendance (COA) and the Student Aid Index (SAI) are used to help determine your Financial Need.

Financial Aid Offer

The total amount of financial aid that a student receives is detailed in a financial aid offer letter. The letter outlines the amount and types of aid a student is eligible to receive, institutional charges, and the out-of-pocket expense for the year.

* **Prospective full-time students:**after admission and completion of the FAFSA, aid offers are released on a rolling basis beginning early to mid-February.
* **Returning full-time students:** after completion of the FAFSA by March 1 and submitting required documents (if applicable), aid offers are released on a rolling basis beginning the first week in July.

## In Their Words

Financial Support

Scholarships are what made my college choice so evident. Coming from a single-parent household, affording college was always a concern for me, but receiving my financial aid package allowed me to actually picture myself in higher education, pursuing my goals.
