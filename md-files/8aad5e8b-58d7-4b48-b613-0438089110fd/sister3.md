## **Application Process**

I think it’s really great! Taking more advanced classes instead of high school ones. And it’s free! So that’s amazing!

*Early College student*

My son wanted to keep taking math classes, but he couldn’t do this through high school because he topped out. To be able to have him be on campus last year and attend classes and be with other students, that was really important. It’s just been wonderful! He’s been able to take everything so far that we were looking for.

Early College allowed me to start my college career knowing that I can complete college-level courses and in a field that interests me.
