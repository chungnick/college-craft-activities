# ****Credit Courses** & Study Abroad**

Rice offers summer courses for credit to visiting students and study abroad opportunities for current Rice undergraduates. If you are a high school or college student visiting from another institution, you can apply online for Rice summer courses and earn college credit that may transfer back to your home school. If you are a current Rice student, you can earn credit abroad through Rice-approved Study Abroad programs designed for academic enrichment and new perspectives.

# **Summer Enrichment** **Programs**

Rice University’s Summer Enrichment Programs offer opportunities for K–12 students to learn, play and grow over the summer. From sports camps with Rice coaches to our STEM-LETICS Academy and Summer Youth Activity Program, these experiences focus on skill-building, teamwork, and fun—not academic credit.
