## Gain Hands-On Experience in Pediatric Biomedical Sciences

We will not be offering the High School Summer Internship during the summer of 2026.

We are taking this time to re-imagine and enhance our high school programs to better serve student interests and career development goals. We are excited to announce that we will be launching an application for a newly designed summer experience specifically for high school seniors in November 2026.

This new program will build on our commitment to providing exceptional hands-on learning and professional development opportunities for aspiring young professionals. We look forward to sharing more details about this exciting initiative later this year.

Current high school juniors and their families are encouraged to check back in November 2026 for information about the application process and program details.

If you have questions, please contact us at [hssummerinternship@cchmc.org](mailto:hssummerinternship@cchmc.org "Email the High School Summer Internship program.").

[The Experience](#_collapseF058A1E85EA848809CB391BEE20A0E65)

All Summer interns will shadow their primary mentor in the clinic and can participate in clinical or research projects (see photos from past summers below). Follow the links to mentor faculty webpages in the box below to help you decide which specialty and faculty mentor you would like to work with. You will be asked to rank the top specialties you are interested in and discuss your reasoning for your ranking in an essay as part of the application. Please note, all applicants are required to complete the online application and all requirements before a placement is confirmed.

Each summer intern will have a unique experience. Interns also have the option of observing in other specialties upon request. All interns attend a weekly group luncheon every Tuesday to network with their peers and interact with other specialists. There are also scheduled group activities including a hands-on training session with computerized simulated pediatric patients in the SIM Center (see photos), group community service opportunities and lunch seminars with featured speakers from a variety of specialties. At the end of the internship, students present a summary of their unique experiences to the group at the graduation party.

The internship group gathers outside to enjoy some summer weather.

Summer interns have the opportunity to learn and practice what they've learned with a simulator.

Wearing scrubs is part of the learning experience for many of the internship participants.

Group activities are great for team building and accomplishing tasks together.

Members of the summer internship program spend time on hands-on learning activities.

Final presentation day for the 2025 high school summer interns.
