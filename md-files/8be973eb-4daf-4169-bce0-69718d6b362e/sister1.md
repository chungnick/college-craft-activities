TKS Financial Aid

# Making TKS accessible for everyone, everywhere.

We’re committed to ensuring that financial limitations don’t hold back the next generation of innovators. Learn about our financial aid and support.

Why This Matters

## We believe in human potential.

If you’ve got the ambition, a price tag shouldn’t stand in your way. That’s why we help fund financial aid, so more young people can achieve what they’re capable of.

### Financial aid is intended to provide tuition support to applicants who demonstrate excellence in the core values of TKS:

#### Achieve their potential.

#### Be unconventional.

#### Build real projects.

#### Do things that matter.

## How It Works

Step 1:

### Submit your TKS application

Start by applying to the TKS program. During the application, you'll be asked if you require financial support.

Step 2:

### Apply for financial aid

You will be sent details on how to apply for financial aid. Your parents should be involved at this step.

## Eligibility

### Our financial aid program is needs-based. Funding is provided to families for the following reasons:

#### Low household income.

#### International students with limited access.

#### Large families with many dependents.

### Our Financial Aid Team assesses the application based on a scoring rubric that ensures that the applications are reviewed fairly across all students applying for financial aid.

Funds are limited and granted on a rolling basis. Access to financial support is more likely for students who apply earlier to join TKS.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions? We’ve got answers on how aid works, eligibility, deadlines, and more.

01

How is TKS different from school?

TKS was desgined after the learning environments of Silicon Valley and built with leaders from Google, Stanford, and McKinsey. It prepares students to lead in a world shaped by AI and exponential technologies.

TKS runs in parallel to school and is designed to prepare young people for the future - no memorization, no textbooks, no tests. Students explore 40+ emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, and genomics, while working on projects that can lead to published research, internships, or launching startups.

With mentorship from global experts and connections to organizations like Microsoft and the UN, students build the skills and confidence to create real impact.

02

What is the time commitment?

TKS requires a meaningful but manageable time commitment - similar to training for a sport or musical instrument. Most students spend 7–10 hours per week, which includes one live session (3 hours), hands-on projects, and optional deep dives.

The program is flexible and designed to fit alongside school and other activities. We’ll help you balance your workload, so it feels energizing, not overwhelming

03

Do I need a background in tech or science to join?

No background in tech or science? No problem. TKS is designed for curious students, whether you’re just starting out or already exploring fields like AI and robotics.

Artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry. We help students understand how it works and how to use it as a creative tool, even if they’ve never coded before. You’ll learn how to think critically, work with AI systems, and build solutions that matter.

All you need is an open mind and the drive to grow. Our expert mentors, personal coaches, and supportive alumni help guide you every step of the way.

04

What kinds of things do students actually do in TKS?

Students in TKS work on hands-on projects that explore real-world problems like using AI to detect wildfires, exploring gene editing for rare diseases, designing biodegradable materials, or building tools for clean energy access. These aren’t hypothetical exercises; they help students explore how break through ideas can be applied to complex challenges.

Throughout the program, students are encouraged to think independently, collaborate with peers, and get feedback from industry experts. They might write research reports, build prototypes, start initiatives, or contribute to larger global projects.

The experience is fast-paced and challenging, but also supportive. The goal isn’t perfect answers; it’s building better thinkers, leaders, and problem-solvers. By the end of the program, most students have a portfolio that reflects their growth, interests, and ability to solve complex problems.

05

How much does it cost, and is financial aid available?

TKSis a 10-month experience that includes personalized coaching, mentorship, and access to global opportunities.

Costs vary by location:

###### In-Person Programs

* New York City, San Francisco, Dubai: $639/month
* Toronto,Vancouver: $589/month
* Calgary: $539/month

*Deposit:**$1,000 (due at enrollment)*

‍

###### Global Virtual Program

* $489/month (USD)

‍

###### Financial Aid

We offer financial aid and flexible payment plans. You can apply for financial aid *after* receiving an acceptance into TKS.

For more information contact our admissions team. We’re here to help.

06

How many students get accepted into TKS?

TKS is a selective program, with over 25,000 applications from students around the world. But we’re not looking for "perfect" students. We’re looking for curious, driven teens who are excited to grow, meet like-minded people, make real impact, and explore their potential.

Each cohort is kept small on purpose. That way, students can get personalized coaching, real feedback, and access to unique opportunities that would be hard to find in larger programs.

If you’re genuinely curious and ready to challenge yourself, we encourage you to apply, even if you’re unsure you’ll get in. You might surprise yourself.

07

What do students go on to do after TKS?

TKS alumni have gone on to launch startups, speak at global conferences, publish original research, and work with organizations like OpenAI, NASA, and the UN.

Our alumni are amongst the youngest employees at companies like Google, Apple, Tesla, SpaceX, IBM, Microsoft, and others.

They've been admitted to universities including Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Waterloo, UofT, UPenn, Oxford, Cambridge, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon and Yale.

But more importantly, they leave with the mindset, network, and skills to shape their own path-no matter what field they pursue.
