# Questions? We’ve got answers.

Whether you're curious about the curriculum, time commitment, or how TKS helps with university - start here.

Why Mentorship is a Game-Changer

## Everything you need to know.

Here are answers to the most common questions around the program. Whether its about the structure, financial aid, student life or anything in between.

num

Which cities have in-person TKS programs? If it’s not in my city can I still participate?

We have in-person programs in New York, San Francisco, Dubai, Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary. Don’t see your city listed here? No worries. You can apply for our Global Virtual program, which is online. We also host meetups in cities that have TKS alumni so you can have an in-person connection.

num

What's the time commitment?

The duration of weekly sessions are 3 hours. The day and time will depend on the cohort you select upon being accepted. Usually, these sessions are on the weekend or weekday evenings.

Outside of sessions, students work on a variety of projects. There are no set time requirements, however students who grow the most during TKS typically allocate 5-10 hours weekly to their projects.

There's no homework in TKS. We've designed the program to reflect the real world and built our own learning platform for students to dive into emerging technologies/sciences, connect with mentors, and work on projects at their own pace.

We also host optional events, such as guest speakers and workshops on topics ranging from mental health, time management, and machine learning. These are typically 1 hour.

Overall, we've designed the program for the students. You can grow at your own pace, but at minimum attend the weekly sessions.

num

What topics can I study at TKS?

TKS has 40+ internal learning modules where students can learn about a variety of emerging sciences and technologies - called **Explore Modules**.

Each student can “explore” these learning modules. They include a few hours of hand-picked learning articles and videos.

After some exploration, students choose a focus area. We provide them with guidance on how to complete a “Focus”, along with specialized Focus Mentors.

Within each Focus, students develop depth of knowledge in the topic through our project-based learning approach. This includes creating articles and videos around technical research, building algorithms/computer projects yourself, or interviewing researchers in the field. By joining TKS, students have access to our learning frameworks, guidelines and approaches.

Some examples of topics we offer:

- Alternative Energy

- Material Science

- Artificial Intelligence

- Brain-computer Interfaces

- Nanotechnology

- Cellular Agriculture

- Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies

- Space Exploration

- Cancer treatments

- Metaverse

- Metabolomics

… and the list goes on.

‍

Students can Focus on whatever interests them - we prioritize curiosity. If the topic they’re passionate about isn’t available, they’re still able to complete a Focus in it.

num

What payment methods are available?

Payment can be made in two ways:

1. Single Payment: Students can receive a $500 discount by paying for their full tuition up front.

2. Monthly Payments: Tuition can be paid in 10 monthly instalments plus deposit.

‍

We accept payment via credit card, debit card, and pre authorized bank transfers. If this will be an issue, please contact us for alternative methods.

num

What have alumni worked on after completing TKS?

Our alumni are redefining what young people can accomplish. Some examples include:

* Building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at Google DeepMind, SanctuaryAI, and OpenAI.
* Working on cutting-edge cancer therapies and conducting clinical trials at research labs in Stanford, Harvard, and Berkeley.
* Researching alternative energy like Fusion at companies like General Fusion.
* Working on advancements in space at companies like SpaceX and NASA.
* Building quantum-machine learning algorithms at Rigetti and IBM.
* Becoming thought-leaders and paid consultants in areas like alternative protein and healthcare.
* Starting venture-backed companies and raising millions of dollars. Our alumni have raised over $80,000,000 for their startups.
* Attend top-tier universities including Harvard, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Waterloo, and Cambridge.

num

Here's a video of a TKS student explaining what happens during TKS sessions: https://youtu.be/o4z7zs7vSw8?si=mR3yFD4QiJhZHqxk

num

What does the application process look like?

We want you to get into TKS, and our process is simple and transparent. There are two steps:

‍**1. Written Questions:**

* What's an experience that has shaped how you see the world, and the impact you want to have?
* What’s something about you that’s unique from others, and how did you realize you were different?
* What's something you've done or built that you're proud of?

‍**2. Interview (20 minutes):**

* Join an interview with a program director. You'll be invited to select a time once your written questions are reviewed.
* [Check out this guide for an advance peek at the questions and tips to help you prepare for the interview.](https://tksworld.notion.site/What-we-look-for-in-a-great-TKS-interview-dd1b768944fc4969836dabdf8dbb1510?pvs=4)

‍

This process is designed to understand your curiosity, ambition, and motivation. We’re excited to hear your story.

*Note: We don't ask for your grades or academic performance. We believe that success in the real world depends on traits beyond what traditional education systems evaluate.*

num

What are the eligibility requirements to apply for TKS?

This program is designed for high school students between the ages of 13-17 years old.

In addition to the age requirement, you must also:

* Be proficient in English.
* Have access to good internet connection.

You do **not** need previous knowledge about emerging technology and coding, however having this knowledge can be helpful during the program.

*Note: At the time of applying, you can be 12 years old.*

num

Is there financial aid available?

Yes, we believe that financial barriers should not impact a student's ability to access quality education.

We've provided hundreds of students around the world with financial aid, which have helped them attend the program.

Our financial aid fund is supported by sponsorships from partners like Interac, BenchSci, Cenovus, Masason Foundation, RBC, Shell, and others. As an organization, TKS also contributes over 50% of our financial aid fund.

Financial aid is only provided to families that need financial support. These funds do not need to be repaid.

*Note: Distributions are limited to the fund size. The sooner you apply, the higher chances you have to receive support.*

num

What are we looking for in the interview?

[Here is a guide that will help you answer the interview questions.](https://tksworld.notion.site/What-we-look-for-in-a-great-TKS-interview-dd1b768944fc4969836dabdf8dbb1510)

*Note: We do not ask for your grades or academic performance. We believe that success in the real-world depends on traits that are beyond what traditional education systems evaluate.*

num

Do I need technical knowledge to join?

No, you don't need previous technical knowledge or coding skills to join. However, having this knowledge can be helpful.

During the program, you will learn the knowledge and skills you need to develop projects in your interest areas. We provide guidance and coaching along the way so you feel supported and motivated, especially when working on complex subjects.

We provide playbooks, mentorship, and resources to help you learn what you need to accomplish your goals.

num

Can TKS help me get into university?

During the program, students work on unique projects and develop a personal portfolio that they use when applying to university.

We also host workshops with alumni who share their experiences and tips for applying to universities.

‍

Our alumni attend universities including:

* Harvard University
* Stanford University
* MIT
* UC Berkeley
* Carnegie Mellon University
* Johns Hopkins University
* University of Pennsylvania
* UC San Diego
* University of Waterloo
* University of Toronto
* Queens University
* Minerva Schools at KGI
* Oxford University
* University of North Carolina, Morehead Cain Scholars Program

... and many more.

‍

While we support our students with their post-secondary journeys, the program is designed for their personal growth and development in real-world skills, foundational mindsets, networks, and knowledge of emerging technologies to solve real-world problems.

num

Is there a refund policy?

Yes - we understand that situations can change. If you join TKS and during the year would like to withdraw your enrolment, you may be eligible to receive a partial refund, dependent on your payment plan. We’ve created guidelines around our refund policy, which will be outlined in our terms & conditions to be sent out upon program acceptance.

num

How much does TKS cost?

You can find the tuition fees for the virtual program and in-person program on the program pages. Go to the menu (top right) and select your city or the virtual program.

num

How long does the program run for?

The program runs for 10-months, from September to June. During that time, students attend weekly sessions and participate in events including guest speakers, workshops, and more.

num

Do we look at students’ grades as part of our assessment?

No. We believe that grades aren’t a wholistic representation of your potential. Our application questions and interview help us evaluate your curiosity, desire to make impact, and drive. We're not looking for what you have done in the past, but rather what we can help you accomplish in the future.
