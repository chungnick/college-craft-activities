## Youth Exchange Program

*Due to recent funding cuts, this program will be postponed until further notice. We understand the impact this decision may have and are actively seeking alternative solutions to resume our services. We appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging time and we will share updates on any developments.*

## About

The Youth Exchange Program (YEP) is an exciting transformative two-week summer adventure for 24 high school seniors from across Montana and Chicago. This program dives into the core principles of democracy, examining them through both urban and rural perspectives. The goal is to celebrate the unique traits of each community, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for our differences, while appreciating the commonalities that unite us.

In our diverse society, where we live, work, and study shapes our lives, from our daily routine to the communities we build. These choices influence how we see the world and impact our views on public policies. Recognizing this, the urban-rural exchange aims to bridge the societal gaps, highlighting shared values and aspirations.   
  
 Participants travel to both Montana and Chicago, extensively engaging with politicians, nonprofit organizations, and community leaders. These immersive experiences broaden their perspectives and empower them to make meaningful contributions through hands-on community service. Plus, they enjoy unique local activities throughout their journey.  
  
 At the heart of YEP lies the legacy of Mike Mansfield, the nation’s longest-serving Senate Majority Leader, revered for his principled leadership. Mansfield's remarkable ability to uncover common ground and bridge divides made a lasting impact on governance. His famous "yep" response to reporters symbolizes the program's commitment to impactful and concise actions. By embracing the Mansfield way, YEP aims to inspire the next generation of leaders to connect across urban and rural landscapes, fostering a more united country.
