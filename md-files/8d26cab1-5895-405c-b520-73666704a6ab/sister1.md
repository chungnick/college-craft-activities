# Tuition and Costs

## Your greatest investment

There is no bigger investment in your life that will continue to pay you back than
obtaining a degree. But. That doesn’t mean understanding how to pay for college isn’t
riddled with anxiety. That’s why we’re here. Every step of the way.

Understanding the cost of attending college

Tuition is an important consideration when you’re weighing your options for higher
education. In this section we’ll start with that detail — how much it costs to attend
classes as a full-time or part-time student.   
  
Then we’ll give you a view of the big picture through a look at Cost of Attendance
(COA). This is a rough estimate of your tuition, residence life and dining costs and
fees. The COA will help you make broader comparisons and is the starting point for
you to see the impact of financial aid and scholarship opportunities, as well as housing
choices.    
  
Select your education goals to see the COA estimates, explore details about tuition,
fees, financial aid, scholarships and options for housing and dining.
