## Welcome to Financial Aid

The Financial Aid Office at UM is your one-stop resource for help paying for college. From understanding all the different types of financial assistance available and how it covers tuition costs to submitting your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and applying for student loans, we are here to help you navigate the financial aid process every step of your higher education journey.

The Financial Aid Office is located on the [fifth floor of Aber Hall.](https://map.umt.edu/?id=1906#!ce/54463?ct/70522,70267,52131,70268?m/930623?s/#!m/544393?ce/53588?ct/52930,52138) Please come visit us for all your financial aid needs.

At the University of Montana, financial aid is about more than dollars and cents — and you’ll never feel like just a number. Our Financial Aid Office strives to be both accessible and responsive. Read on to learn more about scholarships, grants, student loans, how to apply for financial aid and more.

## How to apply for financial aid

The first step is to apply for admission to UM and submit your  Free Application for Federal Student Aid application, which is commonly referred to as the FAFSA. Once you are accepted into a degree or certificate program and your FAFSA is processed, you’ll be notified of your financial aid award offer. [Learn more about the financial aid application process at the University of Montana](https://www.umt.edu/finaid/apply-for-aid/default.php).

### How to complete the FAFSA

Your application for financial aid begins with the FAFSA — the form you need to complete to receive any financial assistance from the federal government to help pay for college. The FAFSA is free and can be easily submitted online. [Complete your FAFSA now at the Federal Student Aid website](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa).

### Deadline for FAFSA

You must submit the FAFSA before each academic year for which you wish to receive financial aid. [View deadlines for your state at the Federal Student Aid website](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa).
