## ARCH-Saint Regis Mohawk Scholars Programs

  
  

The ARCH is a four-year grant awarded by Indian Health Service (IHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The newly established ARCH kicks off its first project – The Saint Regis Mohawk Research Scholars Program. This program includes three major components: Mohawk Youth Health Ambassador (MYHA) Afterschool Program; High School Summer Research Internships; and College Summer Research Internships.

#### **Mohawk Youth Health Ambassador Afterschool Program**

  

The MYHA Afterschool Program invites Mohawk students at the junior level in high school to participate in a 60-minute afterschool session to join conversations about community health, science, and research through a combination of Indigenous Knowledge and western science. Students meet on a weekly basis with the ARCH Project Coordinator and virtual speakers like Roswell Park researchers, SRMT department leaders, and other Haudenosaunee leaders in health and wellness to learn about health equity, health disparities, and health-related areas of study and careers. The goal is to engage and support young Mohawk health ambassadors of today and for future generations.
