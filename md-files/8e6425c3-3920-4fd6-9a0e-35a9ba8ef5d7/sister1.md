Ted R. Lilley CURE Program intern Emely Perez Quintana presents her research project at the Research Internship Poster Symposium in the Knight Cancer Research Building, 2025.

“My brother had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. When he passed away I was dumbfounded that not a single treatment was capable of curing a common cancer," says 2018 CURE Program intern Guadalupe. "I questioned everything and it made me want to know why this type of cancer couldn’t be cured in him when the treatment had cured others. It sparked my interest in cancer research.”
