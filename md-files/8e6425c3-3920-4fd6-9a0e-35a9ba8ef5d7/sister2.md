# Knight Scholars Program

## Help us end cancer as we know it

The Knight Scholars Program offers high school students a chance to explore a range of careers in cancer research, prevention, and treatment at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland and in their home communities across Oregon.

Scholars will be paid a stipend. For activities at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, we will arrange (and pay) for scholars to stay in a nearby hotel or in a residence hall at Portland State University.

We’re looking to engage students from underserved communities, including students from rural areas across Oregon.

For more information, visit the website for the [Knight Scholars Program](https://sites.google.com/view/joinknightscholars).

**Applications are currently closed.**

| Program | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduction | 1 week | Spend one week at OHSU touring labs and meeting scientists who represent a range of cancer-related careers. |
| Immersion | 10 weeks | Spend two weeks at OHSU engaging with scientists and six weeks shadowing clinical, public health and community organization professionals in their own communities. Must have completed Introduction. |
| Intensive | 10 weeks | Spend six weeks at OHSU working in a cancer research lab and four weeks in their local communities. Must have completed Immersion. |

The Knight Scholars Program has been bringing high school students from across Oregon to the Knight Cancer Research Building in Portland since 2019.

## Student safety is our top priority

Before starting any OHSU program, participants need to meet all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunization guidelines for health care workers. These are meant to provide a safe environment for students, employees, and patients at OHSU and participating clinical and research training sites.

Most program activities are in person. Some are online. Students should be comfortable with both.

## Yes, you can have a career in this field.

“Many people think working in cancer means being an oncologist, but cancer research and cancer education through public health outreach are also part of the larger cancer professional picture. This program will expose a diverse group of high school students to all of those as real, tangible opportunities for their futures. We want kids to get excited about this.”
