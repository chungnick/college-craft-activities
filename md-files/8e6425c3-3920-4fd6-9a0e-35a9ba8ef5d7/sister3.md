# Biomedical & Bioinformatics Research Internship and Training Experience (B-BRITE) at the Knight Cancer Institute

B-BRITE interns and program directors gather before the 2025 Research Internship Poster Symposium.

## Engaging Curiosity in the Next Generation of Biomedical Scientists

The Biomedical & Bioinformatics Research Internship and Training Experience (B-BRITE) aims to inspire curiosity in the next generation of research scientists by providing upper-level undergraduates hands-on research opportunities at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute and an introduction to cancer research career paths.

The B-BRITE summer internship program seeks highly motivated college students interested in exploring biomedical research as a career path. B-BRITE interns will work directly with accomplished mentors during an 8-week immersive research experience from **June 22 to August 14, 2026**. Interns will work in  Knight Cancer Institute laboratories at the Oregon Health & Science University campus in Portland, Oregon.

The B-BRITE Summer Program at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute offers:

* Participation in a guided research project facilitated by an experienced researcher.
* Hands-on experience in cutting-edge biological and/or quantitative cancer research methods.
* An introduction to experimental design and data analysis.
* Educational and professional development seminars and trainings.
* Development of written and oral communication skills, including preparing and presenting a scientific research poster.
* Networking within a broad community of scientists.
* Stipend of $4,500 for the full 8-week program.
* Limited need-based housing and travel support may be available.
* [See our 2025 program schedule](/sites/default/files/2025-10/B-BRITE%202025%20Summer%20Event%20Schedule.pdf "2025 B-BRITE Summer Schedule ")

If you have questions or would like additional information, please email us at [cancerbiointern@ohsu.edu](mailto:at%E2%80%AFcancerbiointern@ohsu.edu).

## Application

Applications for the 2026 Summer Program open on **November 10, 2025**. All application materials **must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. (PST) on Thursday, January 22, 2026**. Late submissions will not be accepted. Applicants will be notified of decisions in early March 2026.

[Apply Now](https://app.rlogx.com/training-opportunity/9DAD8E45-53B5-E04B-D4EF-968ABF44)

## Eligibility

* We are looking for motivated college undergraduates with a strong interest in a career in biomedical and data sciences who have completed foundational introductory science courses. Depending on a student’s research interests, this might include biochemistry or computer science courses.
* Applicants will have completed at least two undergraduate years but will not have graduated by the start date of the program in June 2026.
* Students must be available and present for the entire duration of the internship, from June 22 – August 14, 2026. No vacations or breaks may be taken.  A commitment of 40 hours per week is required, including time spent on research and educational programming.
* Visa sponsorship is not available for this program. International students enrolled at a U.S. institution with a valid visa may be eligible to participate, subject to approval from their designated school official.
* **Students must be at least 18 years of age by the start of the B-BRITE program in order to participate.**

Undergraduates with strong motivation for gaining hands-on research experience, including first generation college students, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those at schools without comparable research facilities, are encouraged to apply.   While prior experience in research is not required to participate in the B-BRITE Summer Program, successful applicants will have skills important for contributing to a research group such as curiosity, teamwork, resilience, creativity, and problem solving.

Are you unsure whether this program is a match for you? Information about other internship and training opportunities at the Knight Cancer Institute and OHSU can be found at [Summer Internships.](https://www.ohsu.edu/education/summer-internships)

## Frequently asked questions

### What is included in the application?

Our application consists of a form requesting information about you and your research experience and interests.

We also request the name and contact information of a**t least one, and no more than two,** professors or supervisors who can provide **letter(s)** of recommendation commenting on your potential to be successful working in a basic science research environment.

**In addition to completing the application form, you will need to submit the following:**

1. Resume/CV (highlight science courses and any lab or work experience, if applicable).

2. Unofficial college transcript(s) from the past 12 months (if selected, official transcripts may be requested).

3. A one-page (single-spaced) essay explaining your motivation for applying to the B-BRITE program at the Knight Cancer Institute. In your response, describe a personal, academic, or professional experience that sparked your interest in cancer research. What aspects of cancer biology, treatment, or prevention are you most curious to explore through laboratory or computational research? Why are you specifically drawn to the research environment and mission of OHSU and the Knight Cancer Institute? Finally, how do you envision this summer experience shaping your long-term career in cancer research or related fields?

All applications and materials MUST be submitted by 11:59 p.m. PST on Thursday, January 22, 2026. Late applications will not be accepted. Notifications will be sent out in early March 2026.

### I will be graduating in spring 2026. Am I eligible to apply?

No. Only students who have **not** completed a four year degree by the start of the program are eligible.

### What is the time commitment?

This is a full-time internship experience. Interns are expected to work 40 hours per week in the lab and participate in scheduled activities. Interns should discuss scheduling details with their assigned mentor.

### Is it possible for me to take other courses during the summer program?

B-BRITE interns are expected to participate full-time, from approximately 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every weekday. In addition, interns will prepare a poster presentation of their research project and may attend other scientific seminars while at OHSU. Therefore, it is not advisable that interns pursue other coursework during the program.

### Are vacations or breaks allowed during the program?

Vacations or breaks are not allowed during the internship due to the intensive nature of the program. The internship is a full-time commitment and therefore should not be combined with significant other school or work.

### Will I get paid?

Students selected for the internship will receive a stipend of $4,500 for the full 8-week program.

### Are housing and travel provided?

Housing and travel support will be awarded to a limited number of interns, based on need. Please indicate in your application if you would like to apply for airfare and housing support.

### Are there any health or vaccination requirements to participate in the program?

All interns onboarded at OHSU are required to meet institutional health and safety requirements. If selected for the program, you may be asked to verify your vaccination records depending on your lab placement. Please be prepared to adhere to these requirements, as compliance is necessary to participate in an in-person internship at OHSU.

### How are mentors chosen?

We strive to match interns and mentors based on research interests; however, not all Knight Cancer Institute researchers are available to serve as mentors during any given summer. The more explicit you are in your application about your research interests, the better we can match you with a mentor.  You can learn more about the research being conducted in the 4 CCSG research programs at the [Knight Cancer Institute Cancer Research Centers, Groups and Labs](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute/cancer-research-centers-groups-and-labs)

### Where is the internship located?

The internship takes place in Knight Cancer Institute laboratories at either the OHSU South Waterfront Campus or Marquam Hill Campus in Portland, OR.  Interns are expected to use mass transit or a bicycle to get to campus (daily on-site parking is available, but it is expensive and not guaranteed). These locations are easily accessible by public transportation; public transit passes will be provided by the program.

### When will I be notified of acceptance?

Notifications will be sent out in early March via email. There will be several onboarding steps to complete before the internship begins, so please be sure to monitor your emails and act quickly if you are accepted.
