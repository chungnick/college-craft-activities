# Albany's LIGHT Youth Employment Programs

The City of Albany’s LIGHT Youth Employment Programs provides employment for youth between the ages of 14-18. LIGHT stands for Learning Initiatives and Gaining Headway Together, which symbolizes the program curriculum that we use in all Youth Employment programs. The City of Albany’s LIGHT programs has served as a way to introduce youth to the labor market by helping them acquire skills and insight with work experience that can be used to improve school performance and become responsible adults. Research confirms that participation in SYEP improves school performance.

## Albany's LIGHT Program Aims to:

* Provide earned income to Albany youth
* Introduce and prepare youth for the world of work
* Expose our youth to the various businesses and sectors locally
* Learn transferable skills and habits from leaders in the industry
* Provide youth voice and added value to local businesses on special projects and day-to-day functions
* Create a network of professionals and caring adults for Albany’s youth.
