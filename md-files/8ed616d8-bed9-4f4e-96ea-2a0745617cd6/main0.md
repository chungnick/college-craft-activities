SSP Closing Ceremony Poster Session

## Program Overview

Founded in 2010, the Summer Student Program is designed for high school students who are interested in pursuing careers in the biomedical sciences.

### The program is focused on two distinct areas:

#### Independent research in a stimulating learning environment

Students will have a chance to take part in an 8-week, biomedical or computational lab-based internship in a Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) research lab. Students are paired with a mentor who supervises their activities, helping them develop appropriate technical skills. Over the course of the internship, students complete a self-directed project that supports the Principal Investigator’s overall research objectives. Through participation in laboratory meetings and program sessions, students are exposed to a variety of people within their assigned laboratories and MSK community.

#### Professional and Personal Development

The students will also explore outside of the laboratory, in an effort to provide an additional facet to life as a scientist.  These events will give insight into the world of translational medicine and research. The events are hosted by programs throughout Memorial Sloan Kettering, including the Office of Scientific Education & Training, various Memorial Hospital clinical departments, and Human Resources.

**The 8-week program begins on June 29 and ends August 21, 2026.**

Students receive a stipend of $1,200 for the summer. Housing is not provided.

## Areas of Research

* Cancer biology
* Cell & Molecular & Developmental Biology
* Chemistry/Chemical biology
* Computer Science/ Computational Biology/ Genomics
* Engineering/ Optics/ Imaging/ Research Tools
* Immunology/ Immuno-oncology
* Pharmacology & Drug Development
* Structural Biology

## Eligibility Requirements

Students must meet the following criteria:

* Demographic eligibility: The applicant must live in New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut within 25 miles of Main Campus of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on the Upper East Side in Manhattan
* Currently enrolled as a high school junior
* Legally authorized to work in the United States
* A 3.5 grade point average in science subjects
* Must be 14 or older by June 2026
* Submission of application materials by the deadlines
* Eight-week commitment to the program
* A genuine interest in science and laboratory research

## How to Apply

Successful applicants typically demonstrate strong academic achievement and leadership skills and are interested in biomedical sciences and translational cancer research. Members of groups historically underrepresented in medicine and science (including but not limited to individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and persons with disabilities) are strongly encouraged to apply.

Applications for 2026 Summer Student Program will open on December 1, 2025. [Please click here to apply](https://admissions.mskcc.org/portal/apply-at-mskcc?ts=1733107579268&source_id=4101320414442561&utm_source=null&utm_medium=null&utm_campaign=null&utm_term=null&utm_content=null).

* Required short essay responses
* Current resume: A one-page resume highlighting your academic abilities and volunteer and/or professional scientific experience.
* Unofficial transcripts: Transcript(s) from every high school attended.
* Letters of recommendation: Two confidential recommendation letters.

Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is eligible for the Student Summer Program?**

See Eligibility Requirements above. Only current high school juniors with permanent addresses within a 25-mile radius of NYC are eligible. Please only apply if you meet these criteria.

**May I participate in the program for a shorter time?**

Participants are required to complete the full eight weeks of the program onsite through the end of the last day. There are no exceptions. Students unable to adhere to these requirements should not apply.

**May I contact the faculty member of a particular project?**

Applicants and/or their parent(s)/guardian(s) are not permitted to contact individual faculty members during the application process. Violating this policy will automatically disqualify the applicant from consideration.

**Who should write recommendation letters for me?**

For your application to be reviewed, you must have no more than 2 strong recommendation letters from a STEM teacher, guidance counselor or research mentor. The letter should come from someone who can attest to your knowledge, interest, and strength in science, chemistry, and/or biology. Recommendation letters from family or friends will not be accepted.

**Can my research project be used for competition in national science contests?**

The research conducted at MSK is the lab’s Principal Investigator’s intellectual property so a student intern must get permission from the lab head before submitting to an external outlet such as a school project or science fair. If the data that is being collected is under an MSK Institutional Review Board Protocol, the intern will need to be added to that protocol.

**Competition Submission**

As noted above, submissions to competitions based on MSK research are contingent on agreement with the lab PI.

**How many students are accepted to this program?**

The program enrolls 20 interns per summer. We typically receive 1000+ applications and have a 2% acceptance rate.

**If I am accepted, how long will I have to confirm that I will participate in the Summer Student Program?**

After you are accepted, you are expected to confirm your participation in the program within three days of the notification. If you don’t, you will forfeit your spot in the program.

**Can I mail in my application?**

No. All parts of the application (including recommendation letters) must be submitted through our online application system. If you have issues uploading your application, email your documentation to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#400f130514081310120f0712010d13002d332b23236e2f3227).

**Where are you located? Do you provide housing and/or transportation?**

All student research will be conducted on the Main Campus of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We do not provide housing and/or transportation. Should you be accepted into the program, you are responsible for all housing and transportation costs.

**What are the dates and hours of the program?**

Typically, the program runs from the end of June to mid-August. It is a full-time internship, so students are expected to commit to 40 hours per week, Monday to Friday. Students’ hours vary depending on the mentor’s schedule but usually are either 9AM-5PM or 10AM-6PM.

**Whom should I contact if my parent or teacher has further questions?**

Please contact Program Administration by e-mail at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7b34283e2f33282b29343c293a36283b16081018185514091c).
