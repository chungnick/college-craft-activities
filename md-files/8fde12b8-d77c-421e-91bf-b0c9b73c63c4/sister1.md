# Computer Science FAQs

**Q: Is Computer Science SI Residential?**  
**A:** No. Students are to be dropped off (or drive on their own) to campus every weekday at 9am and leave at 4:30pm for the duration of the camp.  UCF will not provide housing for participants.

**Q: What is the cost and what does it cover?**  
**A:** The cost is $1250 and covers instruction, camp shirt, and all materials.

**Q: When are applications due?**  
**A:**The early bird deadline is March 28. These applications will be given first consideration and acceptances will be given to some of these applicants on or before April 7 via email. Any remaining slots available will be filled from applications deferred from this group and those received by the final deadline, April 18. These students will hear back by April 25 via email.

**Q: When is the $300 deposit due?**  
**A:** Deposits for those accepted from the early bird deadline must submit their deposit by April 17. For those accepted after April 25, you must pay your $300 deposit by May 8 to secure your spot. Otherwise, others will be offered an opportunity to attend. **The deposit is non-refundable.**

**Q: When is the remaining payment due?**  
**A:** May 23.

**Q: Are there any scholarships available?**  
**A:** Yes, there are two types of scholarships available for Computer Science SI. (1) Financial Need – Students must establish need as defined by the university. (2) Broadening Participation – Industry partners are committed to increasing the number of underrepresented populations in the STEM fields and have funded scholarships to broaden participation. Students can only receive one scholarship. Those requesting scholarship assistance should contact the program coordinator for more details after being accepted into the program. Note: Scholarships are not given out prior to acceptance to the program.

**Q: How many students are accepted?**  
**A:** A maximum of 35 students will be accepted.

**Q: How are students placed into their programming course?**  
**A:** Students who have not taken the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course will either be placed in the Level 1 or 2 course depending on their mathematics background.  Course placement is determined by the instructor during the application review process.  All students who have completed the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course will be placed in the Level 3: Introduction to Competitive Programming course. Those students with programming knowledge and are applying to Level 3 will be reviewed on an individual basis. Students will be notified in their acceptance email which level they are placed into.

**Q: What about meals?**  
**A:** Meals are not included for this program. Students have two options. They can bring their lunch or they can buy lunch from the on campus dining facilities, which accept cash, credit/debit cards, or touchless payment. Lunch will occur each day in the Student Union, which has many options for the students if they choose to purchase lunch. Students will be monitored by SI staff during lunch.

**Q: Do you use Macs or PCs?**  
**A:** Our lab has PCs, but students may bring their own laptops and use either PCs or Macs. Students are not required to bring their laptops, however.

**Q: What if a student needs to miss a day or two?**  
**A:** We understand with summer travel arrangements that this happens and we are able to accommodate such requests if possible. Due to the group nature of the projects done in the later half of the course, attendance is strongly encouraged. If a student gets sick, we understand the need to stay home. Our staff can help catch them up when they become well.  Please contact the SI manager or instructor for any known absences in advance.
