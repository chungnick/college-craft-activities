**How To Apply**

1. **[Form A](https://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/applications/forma/)** – Complete the [online](https://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/applications/forma/) application **(all programs)**

2. **[Form B](https://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SI_School_recommendation_B.pdf)** – School Recommendation: Complete the top portion and give it to your high school guidance counselor (or another official from your high school). Once completed, your counselor should send **the form and a copy of your current school transcript** directly to [STEM@ucf.edu](mailto:STEM@ucf.edu). If the transcript cannot be emailed, please send the transcript to our [mailing address](https://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/contact-us/).

3. [**Form C**](https://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SI_Teacher_recommendation_C.pdf) – Teacher Recommendation form: Complete the top part and give it to your Mathematics/Science/Computer Science teacher (as defined under eligibility for your program). Once completed, your teacher should scan and send the form directly to [STEM@ucf.edu](mailto:STEM@ucf.edu).

**Program Eligibility Requirements**

**Computer Science Eligibility**Applicants must currently be enrolled in grades 7-11 (minimum age 13 when the institute begins) and they must show interest in Computer Science and Mathematics. Algebra I (or equivalent) is the preferred mathematics prerequisite for the programming and computer science curriculum at SI @ UCF. Applicants will be selected based on a combination of their current school transcript, teacher recommendations, and standardized test scores (PSAT, SAT or ACT). The successful applicant will have maintained a 3.0 average or above, will have shown strong performance in mathematics courses, and will have a strong recommendation from a Computer Science or Mathematics teacher or guidance counselor. Note that prior knowledge of Computer Science is NOT a prerequisite depending on level applying for. Only a very limited number of applicants (up to 35) will be accepted.

**Mathematical Exploration** **Eligibility**Eligible applicants must be enrolled in grades 10 and 11 (entering grades 11 and 12) at the time of application. Applicants must also show an interest in mathematics and extracurricular activities. Algebra 2 (or equivalent) is the preferred prerequisite for the Mathematical Exploration Program at SI @ UCF. Applicants will be selected based on a combination of their application responses, high school GPA, and teacher recommendation. The successful applicant must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on their most recent report card, demonstrate an elevated interest in mathematics, and have a strong recommendation from a recent teacher who can address your mathematical abilities and accomplishments. Students must be 15 years of age at the start of the program. A maximum of 20 students will be accepted.
