**Notes about specific forms:**

* **Sign In/Out Form:**This form allows students to sign themselves in every morning and out every afternoon without a parent/guardian present. Students who are carpooling or driving themselves will be required to have this form on file prior to attending camp. Students may not sign themselves out prior to the end of camp for that day unless arrangements have been made between the parent/guardian and camp coordinator (i.e. leaving early for a doctor’s appointment).
* **Open Lunch Form:** This form allows for students 15 years and older to to be released from the supervision of camp during lunch. Students will be required to go in groups, not individually, with camp participants or lab groups and may not leave campus for lunch. A representative from the camp will be present at the Student Union food court area each day for camper assistance, as needed. Those students under the age of 15 will be monitored by camp staff throughout lunch and will eat in the Student Union.
* **Travel Form (Computer Science):** Provides us information regarding how your student is arriving to student and allows them to sign themselves in and out every afternoon without a parent/guardian present. Students may not sign themselves out prior to the end of camp for that day unless arrangements have been made between the parent/guardian and camp coordinator (i.e. leaving early for a doctor’s appointment).
