# Junior Volunteer Program

## The 2025 program has received the maximum number of applications we can accept. Please check back in early 2026 for information about next year’s program.

*If you submitted an application for the 2025 program, watch your email for follow up from Volunteer Services.*

### General Information about the Program

The Junior Volunteer Program is an opportunity for local high school students to provide valuable, voluntary service in their community. Applicants must be 14 years old and have completed 8th grade by June 16, 2025 in order to be eligible to participate. Acceptance can be quite competitive, depending on how quickly applications are received. This year, the program will have space for forty (40) participants. Interviews will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis. When the program is full, the application will be removed.

### Wayfinding Opportunity

* This year, Junior Volunteers will focus on Welcoming & Wayfinding throughout VCU Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of Richmond
* Our large, urban campus can be difficult to navigate. Patients and visitors appreciate volunteers welcoming them and assisting them in locating their appointment or loved one. This is a great way to interact with a variety of people, learn about our complex facility, and gain experience talking with patients and their families.
* Successful volunteers in this role have a positive attitude, are comfortable talking to people from diverse backgrounds, can remain calm when others are stressed, and are able to walk with others through our complex of buildings. Knowing the buildings in advance is not a requirement but having a sense of direction is helpful!

### Scheduling

* Mandatory training will be offered at several different times June 16-20 (each volunteer only needs to attend one training session)
* Volunteering will last for eight weeks, from June 23, 2025 to August 15, 2025
  + Volunteer shifts are available in three-hour blocks Monday-Friday only: 9am-12pm and 12pm-3pm
  + Each volunteer will be expected to serve at least eight shifts over the eight weeks (no more than two shifts per week)
  + Volunteers will not be guaranteed any particular shift(s); open shifts will be available on a first-come, first-served basis
  + Selecting individual shifts will be through a self-scheduling portal
  + Volunteers are responsible for their own transportation

### Application Process

* For this year's program, spaces are very limited and will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.
* On your application, you must provide an email address that we will use for communications including acceptance, if offered.
* After the program has filled, Volunteer Services will notify applicants by email.
* Individuals who are not offered a placement initially may be placed on a waiting list.

### Acceptance into the Program

Individuals who are offered a placement in the program will be given detailed instructions to complete the participation requirements. Participation is contingent upon meeting our deadlines for completing the following:

* Submitting a participation agreement form
* Submitting health screening documentation
  + Proof of certain immunizations and timely tuberculosis testing; detailed information will be provided to those accepted into the program
  + It will be the responsibility of each selected applicant to complete the requirements and cover any associated costs
* Attending a Volunteer Training
  + Multiple times will be offered for mandatory Volunteer Training to be held June 16-20 (attend only one); detailed information will be provided to those accepted into the program

Thank you for your interest in volunteering!
