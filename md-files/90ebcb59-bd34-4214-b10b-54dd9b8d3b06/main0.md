# WIE Aspire! Explore Engineering

## *Summer 2026 Program Information*

### **Program Overview**

The [Women in Engineering (WIE) Program](https://eng.umd.edu/wie) in the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland (UMD) is excited to offer the WIE Aspire summer program designed for **rising 9th and 10th grade** students who are interested in exploring engineering majors, opportunities, and careers. This week-long, commuter program introduces participants to the field of engineering through hands-on projects, engineering lab and facilities tours, and conversations with faculty, staff, and students in the Clark School of Engineering. UMD Engineering students will serve as summer program interns to support participants with an enriching summer experience.  Our programs are open to all students!

---

### Program Curriculum

Each day you will engage with different engineering majors (Aerospace, Bioengineering, Chemical, Civil & Environmental, Electrical and Computer, Fire Protection, Materials Science,  Mechanical) through department presentations and participate in hands-on activities to illustrate basic engineering concepts and the interdisciplinary nature of engineering.

#### Typical Day

Please note that this serves as an example of a typical day.  Specific activities and times are subject to change. Each day will include department presentations, and hands-on activities and workshops. View the [summer 2025 schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XO4BrviR1lw76aa9wBKszTZ6hqPJdfVq/view?usp=sharing) as an example.
