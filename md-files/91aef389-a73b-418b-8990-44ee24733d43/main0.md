The Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE) program at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering offers unparalleled opportunities for high school students to conduct real-world scientific research at a variety of NYU STEM labs.

Under the guidance of NYU Faculty and graduate researchers, students gain valuable first-hand experience working in a lab and making practical, substantive contributions to the lab’s research objectives in exciting STEM fields, like Biomedical Engineering, Civil and Urban Engineering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and more.

Students will also receive training in presentation and public speaking skills, in collaboration with ARISE’s partners at [Irondale Ensemble Project](http://irondale.org/), and present their research findings at the program’s concluding colloquium to NYU faculty and graduate students, their peer ARISE participants, other academic experts, family members and friends.

ARISE is a 10-week program that takes place during the summer with four weeks of remote after school workshops in June and six weeks of in-person labs starting July 1. It is open to New York City high school students in the 10th or 11th grade. ARISE is offered as a tuition-free program through the support of the [Pinkerton Foundation](http://www.thepinkertonfoundation.org/), with additional funding from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and in partnership with the [New York City Science Research Mentoring Consortium](http://www.studentresearchnyc.org/).

## How to Apply

ARISE is intended to provide an advanced STEM research opportunity to New York City students lacking access to high quality STEM education experiences.

Eligible applicants to ARISE will be New York City high school students currently enrolled in the 10th or 11th grade with strong academic records and demonstrated interest in STEM subjects. Students from groups historically excluded from STEM disciplines and careers are strongly encouraged to apply.

Spaces in the ARISE program are limited and admissions is selective. The application for ARISE is a multi-step process, which includes submission of the online application, a group interview, and lab tours to determine applicants’ placement in one of 32-40 labs.

## Student Life

Students will spend six weeks conducting research at one of 32-40 STEM labs at New York University, reporting to their lab assignment Monday-Friday from 9 AM - 4 PM.

During their lab placement, students will be directed in their research tasks by graduate researchers and faculty, developing technical skills and building a strong foundation for understanding the principles and best practices of conducting research in STEM.

Students will also participate in workshops designed to improve their public speaking and leadership skills, and be able to take advantage of on-campus events and activities organized for NYU’s summer high school students.
