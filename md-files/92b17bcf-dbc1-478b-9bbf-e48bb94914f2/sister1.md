# Residential Programs for Rising 11th/12th Grade Students

## Summer Residential Camps for High School Students

Each summer, the College of Engineering at NC State University offers rising 11th and 12th grade high school students the opportunity to experience engineering and get a glimpse of college life while staying on the NC State campus in Raleigh. The residential program allows students to explore a particular field of engineering in more depth while staying on campus in residential university housing.
