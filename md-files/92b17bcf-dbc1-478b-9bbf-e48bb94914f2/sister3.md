## Send a Child to Camp

The NC State Engineering Foundation, Inc. (NCSEF) was chartered in 1944 to secure private financial support critical to the improvement of the College of Engineering (COE). The Foundation continues to raise funds and engage with alumni to support the important work of the people who define the College. All gifts to the College, its departments and programs, make a difference in the ability of engineering students and faculty to fulfill their own dreams and make a positive impact on the world.
