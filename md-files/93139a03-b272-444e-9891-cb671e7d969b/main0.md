# Application

If you are interested in becoming a Ross counselor, find the [application for 2026](https://mathprograms.org/db?joblist-83) which is available on January 1, 2026. There are multiple sites to choose from and you may apply to one or more locations, i.e., you may apply to the Ohio location and/or apply to the Indiana location.

Counselors will be asked to answer a handful of short essay questions, provide transcripts and a CV, and arrange for at least one reference letter to be written. More details and instructions are provided on the actual applications. Applicants who were employed by the Ross Program in a previous year are not required to submit another recommendation letter.

The Ross Hiring Committee reads counselor applications during February. They expect to make some initial job offers in early March. To be considered in that first round, please submit your application by the end of February.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send any inquiry to [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org).
