# Application & Financial Aid

## Instructions

**The application portal for 2026 is available at <https://apply.rossprogram.org/>**

The math questions are also available: you can get started by [downloading the application problems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossprogram/rossprogram.github.io/master/students/application-problems.pdf).

The core parts of the application are the following:

* responses to some short essay questions,
* a video,
* a teacher recommendation,
* school transcript, and
* work on some challenging math problems.

If you have any questions or otherwise, please feel free to email us at [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org). Note that we will not provide hints on how to solve the math problems posted, but we can answer clarifying questions regarding terminology and phrasing, etc.

## Application Deadline

The [application portal is now available](https://apply.rossprogram.org/) and the math questions will be posted in the next few days. The deadline for Ross applications is March 15. Applications submitted after that date might not receive full consideration. The Ross Admissions Committee will start reading applications on March 16. We aim to have acceptance decisions emailed by mid-April.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Each Ross student is asked to pay a program fee of $7500. Those funds are used to pay for six weeks of room and board, to hire instructors and counselors, and to cover incidental costs of developing and running math courses.

[Financial aid](/participants/faq/#are-scholarships-available) is certainly available. Accepted applicants are encouraged to apply for aid if their families have some financial need. We hope to provide enough support to enable every accepted applicant to attend this great Program.

The Ross Program endeavors to provide enough financial support to enable every accepted student to attend. If you have been accepted to the Ross Program and need financial assistance in order to join us, please ask your parent or guardian to contact us at [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org). We will reply with details on how to apply for scholarship support.

Various academic institutions in the applicant’s home city or state might also have available scholarships. In addition, some scholarship support for participation in math programs can be provided by:

* [Mu Alpha Theta](https://mualphatheta.org/summer-grants),
* the [Davidson Institute](https://davidsongifted.org), and
* the [Jack Kent Cooke Foundation](https://jkcf.org).

## Commitment to Nondiscrimination

The Ross Program does not discriminate on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, ethnic origin, disability, or marital status in its admissions, educational programming, financial aid, employment practices, or other activities.

We recognize the existing gender and racial disparities within the mathematics community. In our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, we highly encourage applications from individuals of underrepresented backgrounds.
