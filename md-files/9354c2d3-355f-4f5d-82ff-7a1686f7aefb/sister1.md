# **Thank You!**

**We are not running the Summer Academies in the Arts program going forward.**

We are so proud of the great work we did to provide excellent training in Art, Dance, Drama, and Music to area youth. Thank you to our artists, educators, staff, faculty, and families who supported the program.

## Arts Outreach

**The mission of Outreach at the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (CTSA) is to connect CTSA with the community in ways that transform lives.**

We partner with local schools and community organizations to share the talents and knowledge of our students, faculty, and staff with people of all ages. Composed of several community-minded programs, we introduce children to the arts, prepare middle and high school students for the next step in their arts education, and provide adults with active experiential immersion in the arts to help enrich lives. CTSA’s Outreach programs support the mission of the school as conduits for community engagement, fostering leadership both in the young artists who participate in them, and in the CTSA students and faculty who facilitate them.
