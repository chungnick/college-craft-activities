[Application FAQ](faq.html)

## MSTP Application Timeline: 2025-2026 Academic Year

Northwestern MSTP only accepts applications through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), and you are strongly encouraged to complete your application (AMCAS, supplemental and letters of recommendation) as early as possible, as we invite candidates to interview on a rolling basis. Your invitation to complete a secondary application may only be sent once you are AMCAS-verified (which can take up to eight weeks).

You may only apply to the MSTP or the MD program, but not both simultaneously. If you apply to the MSTP and wish to have your application transferred for MD-only consideration, [notify MSTP Admissions](mailto:mstp-admissions@northwestern.edu) in writing before November 1. MSTP applications are not automatically transferred for MD-only consideration.

#### Before November 1, 2025

##### Apply Through AMCAS

On the [American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) website](https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/), choose "Northwestern MD-PhD Program (MSTP)." Answer the two MD-PhD-specific questions. Submit your application plus official transcripts to AMCAS. Your invitation to complete the MSTP Secondary Application may only be sent once your AMCAS application has been verified, which may take up to eight weeks.

#### Before November 15, 2025

##### Submit Secondary Application and Letters of Recommendation

Your application must be complete (AMCAS, MSTP Secondary Application and minimum of three letters of recommendation) to be considered for MSTP admission. Request a minimum of three letters of recommendation to be sent as early as possible to the AMCAS letter service. These letters may be included within a committee letter or composite letter or be submitted individually. Applications will not be considered for interview prior to “complete” status. There is no maximum number of recommendation letters that may be submitted.

#### September 2025 - January 2026

##### Interview Invitations and Interviews

Applications are reviewed, and interview invitations are sent by email on a rolling basis starting in late August to early September and may continue as late as January. Interviews are held once per month, September through January. During interviews, applicants meet with Northwestern MSTP leadership, faculty and current students. All interviews will be conducted virtually for the 2025-2026 admissions cycle.

#### October 2025 - May 2026

##### Admissions Offers Sent

Admission will be offered on a rolling basis from October 2025 through May 2026.

#### May 1, 2026

##### National Acceptance Deadline

You must accept your MSTP admission by May 1, 2026. After May 1, you may only hold an offer of admission at one institution.
