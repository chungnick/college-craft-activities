# Bug Camp

## Summer 2026

**We are currently reviewing Bug Camp’s summer programming; at this time we are not yet sure if we will be holding camp in summer 2026. We will share updates as soon as plans are finalized. A final decision is expected by approximately March 1st at the latest.**

Insects are the most abundant animals on earth! Not only are these creepy-crawlies everywhere, they provide many necessary benefits to humans and human society. Through a variety of hands-on activities and interactive field trips, Bug Camp: Insects, Science & Society will teach kids how amazing and valuable bugs truly are. Campers will gain experience with science in the field and the lab, and will come away with an understanding of the important relationship between humans and insects.

Bug Camp: Insects, Science & Society is supported by the University of Maryland’s Department of Entomology​ and the University of Maryland Extension, 4-H Youth Development.

Topics & Activities

* Field trips around the UMD campus to local bug habitats
* Bug bodies and life stages
* Interacting with bugs in their natural environment
* Lab experiments with live bugs

* Pollinators & Pests: How humans and bugs get along
* Bug habitats and houses

## Frequently Asked Questions

When should I expect to receive the additional required documents for camp?

All additional required camp documents will be  emailed to the guardians of registered campers via the email addresses provided on the campers registration form. If you did not receive your packet, please contact, Amy Yaich at [bugcamp@umd.edu](mailto:bugcamp@umd.edu) or by phone at [301-405-3911](tel:+1 301 405 3911).

I forgot which session I enrolled my child in, whom do I contact?

Please email Amy at [bugcamp@umd.edu](mailto:bugcamp@umd.edu) or call her at [301-405-3911](tel:+1 301 405 3911).

What are the procedures for having someone other than a legal guardian pick up my child from camp?

To release a child to someone other than a legal guardian, we will require written permission from a legal guardian.

I have materials I would like to donate to the camp. Whom do I contact?

Feel free to write to us at [bugcamp@umd.edu](mailto:bugcamp@umd.edu) with a description of the materials and someone will be in touch.

I am interested in teaching and/or internship opportunities with your camp. How can I get involved?

Our primary counselors are pulled from a group of 4-H individuals. However, we do offer the internship priority to students from the University of Maryland, particularly those from a math, science, or education track. We will consider interested individuals from outside of the university as well. If you are interested in working for us, please send a brief description of your qualifications and a statement of purpose (what you would like to get out of working at our camp and what you hope to contribute to our camp) to [bugcamp@umd.edu](mailto:bugcamp@umd.edu).

We live out of state or far away. Are there lodging options available?

We do not offer any on-campus lodging. However, the City of College Park has [numerous nearby hotels](https://campustravel.com/university/university-of-maryland-conference-visitor-services/).
