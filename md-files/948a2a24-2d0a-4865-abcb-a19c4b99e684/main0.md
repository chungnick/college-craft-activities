## Parent Testimonials

*“The presentations yesterday were truly impressive for their delivery, attention to time constraints, and especially for the level of understanding that the students achieved in such a short time. Those presentations just reinforced the sense that the internships are a truly unique experience. ”* ~Erik

*“Ashley loves the program and we are continually blown away by what a great opportunity it is! She is learning so much and it’s opening her mind to studies and careers she didn’t know existed.*” ~ Julie

## Intern Excitement

“ARISE exceeded my expectations. I knew I would be working in a lab and going to enrichment activities, but I did not think I would learn as much as I did about the gut microbiome, colorectal cancer, and lab procedures from working in the lab and more about college and career plans from the enrichment activities”  
–*Xavier 2024 Summer Intern*

“ARISE is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. It allows teenagers to find their passions, discover their callings, and learn an insane amount in just 7 weeks. I would recommend this program to everyone I know, and if I could, I’d go back and do it a million more times.”  
*Ellie – 2023 Summer Intern*
