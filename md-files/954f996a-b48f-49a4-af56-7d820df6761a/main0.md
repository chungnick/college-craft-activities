## Testimonials

* > "Coming here has taught me that knowledge is not really power unless it is applied. Through the many amazing opportunities offered here, you will discover that and it will be an unforgettable experience."
  >
  > –Sam Jackson, ND '20
* > "The professors take a unique approach to teaching - they are not afraid to confront controversial issues. They teach us how to think and the possible implications of everything we could do in the future could be. This experience taught me how to apply what I learn to real world problems and issues."
