If you successfully submitted an application for our 2025 Summer Seminar program, that will serve as your preliminary application for the Class of 2030 and you do not need to apply through this website.

## Steps for

### Admission

You can begin the application process as early as your Junior year in high school and we encourage the earlier the better! These steps will provide all the information you need to know about our application requirements and our admissions process.

* [8. Interview](#panel8-Steps-for)
* [9. Admission Selection Process & Deadlines](#panel9-Steps-for)

#### **Eligibility**

You are eligible to apply for the United States Naval Academy if you meet the following criteria:

* A United States Citizen by 1 July of the year of entry
* At least 17 years of age and must not have passed 23rd birthday on 1 July of the year of entry
* Unmarried
* Not pregnant and no dependents
* Have a valid Social Security Number  (If you do not have a Social Security number you can apply for a card here [https://www.ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/))

If you are in high school but are not old enough to apply, you can register with USNA to receive information about our [Summer Programs](../Programs/index.php).

#### **Preliminary Application**

You must submit a preliminary application to become an official candidate for next year's class.

You can submit a preliminary application if you…

1. will be a senior in high school next year
2. are currently in your senior year of high school
3. are a current college student looking to transfer

You will need the following information to complete the preliminary application:

1. Social Security Number
2. High School Educational Testing Service (ETS) Code
3. High School Class Rank
4. Congressional State and District
5. Full Zip Code
6. SAT, ACT or PSAT scores

Upon completion of your preliminary application, and provided you fall within the eligibility age range for entry, you will receive an email with your candidate number and login information for your candidate portal. You will then have access to the entire USNA application.

***If you have applied for our Summer Seminar program you do not need to submit a preliminary application, as they are the same application.***

#### **Apply for Nomination**

You must obtain a nomination from an official source, which normally includes U.S. Representatives or U.S. Senators representing your Congressional district or State, respectively, and the Vice President of the United States. Applying for a nomination is similar to applying for a school. Being personally acquainted with the nominator is not required. We encourage you to apply to all available sources.

It is recommended that you submit your letter of application for nominations immediately after you complete your preliminary application. Do not wait until you receive a nomination to begin your formal USNA application.  Many nomination notifications do not go out until early to mid-January and the deadline for the USNA application is January 31. Your nominator will notify us of your nomination.  You do not need to notify the Academy.

##### Nomination Process and Reference Information:

#### **College Entrance Exams**

All candidates applying for admission to the Naval Academy are required to take either the SAT or the ACT. Detailed information and registration forms for tests may be obtained from the following websites: SAT - www.collegeboard.com; or ACT - www.actstudent.org. The two tests are designed differently and we have observed that many candidates perform better on one than the other. Additionally, students often see a considerable test score improvement on a second or third attempt at both tests. The Naval Academy Admissions Board uses the highest reading and writing score (or critical reading score if taken prior to the digital SAT) for SAT or the English score for ACT and the highest math scores from all the SAT or ACT tests taken by the candidate. We need to receive the full composite score report directly from the testing service (not the superscore report from the College Board or ACT).

 It is your responsibility to ensure that your scores are forwarded to the Naval Academy. **The Naval Academy code for the SAT is 5809 and the ACT is 1742.** Scores recorded on an official transcript are also accepted.  
  
Check with your school counselor or visit the [SAT](https://www.collegeboard.org/) and [ACT](https://www.act.org/) website for test dates and registration requirements. We will accept any ACT or SAT test that is taken before January 31, even if the results are received by USNA afterward. **We do not accept test scores from a test taken with accommodations.**

(Fee waiver information for [SAT](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration/fee-waivers) and [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration/fees/fee-waivers.html))

Note: You may use your PSAT scores for the preliminary qualification; however, these will not be used as final admissions criteria.

#### Transcript

Your high school counselor (or registrar at college) will have the opportunity to upload an official PDF copy of your transcript when they complete the Candidate Academic Information form. 

If your counselor is unable to upload the transcript, they should mail an official transcript to USNA. Mailed transcripts should include your candidate number and be mailed to the following address:

United States Naval Academy  
Office of Admissions   
ATTN: Candidate Guidance  
52 King George Street  
 Annapolis, MD 21402.

#### Medical Examination

The Naval Academy program is physically challenging and we require all candidates to undergo a thorough medical examination.  

The Admissions Department will submit your name to the Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DoDMERB) who will then forward your name to the medical contracting team, CIVTeam/Concorde (DoDMETS). CIVTeam will contact you about scheduling your medical examinations. Once you have completed all your examinations through the CIVTeam contractors, CIVTeam will send your entire medical package to DoDMERB. DoDMERB will carefully review your medical exam to determine if you meet the medical standards for admission. Approximately one month after your physical exam is completed, you will receive (by mail) a status report of the DoDMERB findings. DoDMERB may request that you provide additional information/records regarding illnesses, injuries, surgery, familial diseases, and other factors that could affect your medical status. You may also be asked to schedule follow-up appointments to determine your current medical status. You may check on the status of your medical exam by referring to the **[DoDMERB website](https://dodmerb.tricare.osd.mil/)**.

If you have a disqualifying condition, you will automatically be considered for a waiver if/when you are competitive to receive an offer of appointment to USNA or one of our preparatory programs. You do not need to request a waiver, nor should you send additional medical information to the Naval Academy for review. A waiver of the medical standard may be granted if both your academic record and medical history suggest the risk introduced by the disqualifying condition is justified by your potential for success as a midshipman and as a naval officer. Many candidates will be required to provide additional information to DoDMERB after their first disqualifying medical condition has been waived. This additional information may result in other disqualifying conditions - which will also be considered for waiver. Major medical considerations are summarized in **[Appendix A: Medical Considerations Document.](../_files/Medical_Appendix_24.pdf)** This is not meant to be a comprehensive listing of all disqualifying conditions; it is a brief and general summary for your convenience.

#### Candidate Fitness Assessment

The Candidate Fitness Assessment is used to evaluate coordination, strength, speed, agility, and endurance. If you are accustomed to regular physical activity, you should have no difficulty with the assessment. Maintaining a high level of physical fitness during high school is strongly encouraged to prepare you to meet the physical demands of Plebe Summer and life as a midshipman.

The test consists of a one-mile run, a 'shuttle' run, a kneeling basketball throw, abdominal crunches, push-ups, and pull-ups or a flexed-arm hang for women (when pull-ups cannot be accomplished) and can be administered by a physical education teacher, a team coach, a current JROTC instructor, an active duty commissioned officer, or a Blue and Gold officer (BGO). Family members are not allowed to administer a candidate's CFA.

* [Candidate Fitness Assessment Instructions](../Candidate-Fitness-Assessment.php)

#### Interview

An official interview with a Blue and Gold Officer is required to complete your application.  

Blue and Gold Officers are volunteers comprised of Naval Academy graduates, parents of midshipmen or graduates, and civilians.  Located in every state, they are qualified to guide and support you towards your final decision and through your midshipmen experience.  
   
 All candidates should contact their Blue and Gold Officer immediately upon receipt of their official candidate number. The contact information for your BGO is located on the Candidate Portal under the 'Points of Contact' tab. The preferred communication method for most Blue and Gold Officers is email. Ensure the email address provided in your application is valid and checked regularly. If you do not know who your assigned Blue and Gold Officer is, you may contact the BGO Team to find out (410-293-1814).

#### Selection Process & Deadlines

Maximize your opportunity for admission by paying close attention to deadlines and keeping track of application requirements.     

* On average, of the 3000 students who fully qualify for the Naval Academy, 1,400 will receive appointments and approximately 1,200 become midshipmen.
* The USNA uses a "rolling admissions" selection process.  Most candidates will be notified of their final status by April 15.
* All appointees should notify the Admissions Office of their intention to accept or decline their offer of appointment by May 1.
* After December 31, new applications to the Class of 2030 will not be accepted.
* Applications must be completed by January 31, 2026 or will not be considered for admittance.
