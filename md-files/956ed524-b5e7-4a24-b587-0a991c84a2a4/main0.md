**Join the department summer camps for an immersive nuclear engineering experience. This camp is great for high school aged students who want to learn more about nuclear, for  more information check out the camp below!**

[###### Nuclear Engineering Camp

If you are interested in nuclear engineering, this one-week summer program will introduce you to the fascinating world of nuclear power and the outstanding opportunities in nuclear engineering. Campers interested in continued safe and reliable nuclear energy production, nuclear engineering, use of radiation for biomedical research and medical imaging, how to operate a nuclear reactor, or how nuclear-powered US Navy submarines and aircraft carriers protect US interests at sea, will embrace this unique, hands-on summer program that was designed to introduce them to the fascinating world of nuclear power and the unique opportunities in the world of nuclear engineering.
