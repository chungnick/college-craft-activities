**Capacity:** 40 students  
**Registration Fee**: $1,200 (includes all meals, housing and camp materials)

[Register Now](https://connect.mst.edu/register/Nuclear_2026)

## Camp Activities

Topics include nuclear energy, radiation detection and applications, nuclear materials, nuclear security, nuclear waste management, industrial plasmas, etc. Each day of the one-week course is a combination of interactive lectures, small group projects, and hands-on experiments.

Summer camp leaders demonstrate concepts ranging from radiation detection to reactor physics, where campers are exposed to the topics and materials they will likely study in nuclear engineering in a fun, engaging, and interactive manner.

The security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer used to

communicate with us. We recommend that users take steps to protect against unauthorized access to passwords, computer, and web-enabled devices by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password key on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your passwords private, and periodically changing passwords. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Our third-party service stores personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Where your information is no longer needed, we ensure that it is disposed of securely. There are circumstances when we may be required to store your personal information for longer periods of time to be in compliance with legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements.

#### XII. Social Networking

The University of Missouri provides several opportunities for social networking for both participants and staff on sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. These sites are not affiliated with the University of Missouri and offer their own individual social networking services.

We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this statement at any time. If we materially change our use of your personal information, we will note it in this privacy statement. The effective date of this privacy statement is documented at the beginning of the statement. If you have any questions about our privacy statement, please contact us at [umcompliance@umsystem.edu](mailto:umcompliance@umsystem.edu)
