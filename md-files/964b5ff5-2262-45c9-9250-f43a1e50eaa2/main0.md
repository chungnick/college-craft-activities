## What Is the Circular Innovation Challenge?

The Circular Innovation Challenge is a [precollege summer program](/precollege-programs/) for high school students interested in entrepreneurship, sustainability, and innovation, and it takes place on Lewis & Clark’s [beautiful college campus](https://www.lclark.edu/visit/tour/) in Portland, Oregon, from July 12–17, 2026. The program is run by Lewis & Clark’s [Bates Center for Entrepreneurship and Leadership](/programs/entrepreneurship/).

Over six days, you will learn about the massive opportunities present for innovation in the “circular economy,” which is market space for businesses that prevent waste, circulate products through renewal, and develop new business models that create value without using finite resources. We’re committed to not just teaching processes for entrepreneurship and innovation, but entrepreneurship for a more sustainable future.

* > The camp was so amazing. L&C really put in so much work setting us up with amazing speakers that inspired me.
  >
  > Summer 2025 Student
* > Everything was just perfect about this program. I learned so much from all the speakers, and they were all engaging and interesting. What I also liked about the program is that there was almost never a dull moment. I also loved the field trips because it’s one thing just talking about a textile recycling factory, but then actually visiting it and taking a tour just puts it into perspective how big of an impact they make on the world.

  > Summer 2025 Student
* > This experience was overall incredible and I’m very glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and came here. The content, field trips, group work, etc. was very rewarding and inspirational.
  >
  > Summer 2025 Student
* > I have very much enjoyed the process of learning about circularity and sustainability in a capitalist system. The camp was very fun and I feel like I understand what college life and L&C would feel like.
  >
  > Summer 2025 Student
* > Thank you for such a wonderful opportunity! I learned so much from this experience and fell in love with Lewis & Clark! I especially loved that we went on field trips to the gorge and downtown Portland while also staying on campus. The various mentors helped so much on our project and I think they prepared us for the project well!
