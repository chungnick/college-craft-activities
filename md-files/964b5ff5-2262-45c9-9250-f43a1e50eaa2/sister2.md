# Frequently Asked Questions

#### **FAQ for Parents and Students**

***How do I know you received my application?***

After you fill out your application, press ‘Submit’ and wait for a confirmation page to appear. You will also receive a confirmation email.

***Who can attend the Circular Innovation Challenge?***

Incoming High School Freshman, Sophomores, and Juniors.

***Where do students live during the program?***

All students live together in a residence hall on the Lewis & Clark campus with close supervision provided by Resident Advisors, who live in the same residence hall, and an on-site Resident Director. The Director and faculty provide close supervision during evening events and group-wide off-campus outings. We encourage students to explore our beautiful campus with their new friends.

***When do students arrive and depart?***

Students arrive on campus roughly between 11:00AM and 6:00PM on Sunday July 12th and will be welcomed by resident advisors and Directors. Students depart on the final day, Friday July 17th after the final pitch competition (Flights should be scheduled ideally after 2PM).

***Who are the Resident Advisors?***

Resident Advisors are certified, experienced residential advisors from [BOAT](https://theboatbus.com/) whose top priorities are safety, curating a welcoming community, and making sure every camper gets the most out of their experience. In addition to attending lectures and sessions, the trained Resident Advisors live in the residence hall with the students, making sure the students arrive on time to classes and meals and follow the rules of the program. They also lead fun field trips!

***What do students need to bring to campus?***

A list of everything students need on campus will arrive with the enrollment information.

**What is your policy on medications?**

Our resident director is in charge of holding and administering all medications. All medications must be managed by our RD. Email [chunter@lclark.edu](mailto:chunter@lclark.edu) for questions pertaining to medications.

***What are the rules for students attending the program?***

Before arriving on campus, all participants and their parents sign a Community Code of Conduct form, demonstrating an understanding of the program’s rules. The Circular Innovation Challenge team believes in an open, supportive environment for all participants. If a student fails to follow the Code of Conduct, the student may be sent home.

**We live in Portland, can my child sleep at home?**All campers must stay on campus to get the full effect of the college campus life and Circular Innovation Challenge experience.

***What about transportation to campus?***

If you’re arriving by car, directions will be provided with the enrollment information. On arrival and departure dates, there is a **shuttle service** to and from the Portland International Airport (PDX).

***What about meals? Are there vegetarian options?***

Students are provided with a meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner) at the Fields Dining Room, operated by [**Bon Appétit**](https://lewisandclark.cafebonappetit.com/). There are always vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options available for every meal. Students will pack their own lunch for field trips with the same options from the dining hall.

Campers are welcome to bring their own food or snacks if they wish.

***What if a student has a health concern during the Workshop?***

If a health concern arises during the week, our trained staff follow prescribed procedures, and will immediately contact parents and guardians. All health and medical information is kept confidential.

***What about things like laundry?***

There are laundry machines and dryers in the residence hall. Laundry is free and detergent is provided. If a participant needs a special type of detergent, due to allergies, we ask participants to bring their own.

**Can family or friends visit or observe camp?**Only on dropoff and pickup day. On drop-off day, there will be a chance for parents and family to tour the campus. On pickup day, parents and family are encouraged to attend the final pitches at 10AM on campus. We request no visitors throughout the week.

**How will I receive updates during the week?**While there will be no official updates, @batescenter on instagram will post pictures and updates throughout the week.

***What can students do when not in a Workshop session?***

Year after year, Lewis & Clark College is recognized as a sustainable, picturesque campus. The campus is idyllic in the summer months, and students are free to explore, whether it’s hanging out with new friends, reading in the library, or taking a walk the many trails throughout campus. Students only leave campus when they’re accompanied by faculty or Resident Advisors.

***Will students earn educational credits?***

No. The Circular Innovation Challenge program does not offer college credit.

Additional questions can be sent to the Resident Director: [chunter@lclarkedu](mailto:chunter@lclarkedu).
