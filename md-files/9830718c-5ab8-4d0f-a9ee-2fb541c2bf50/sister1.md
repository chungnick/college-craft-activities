# Admissions

SUMaC invites students who seek to be challenged in mathematics beyond high school subject matter and who would enjoy intensive, in-depth mathematical pursuits to apply.

### SUMaC Admissions

SUMaC is for students who are in 10th or 11th grade at the time of application who have an exceptional interest in mathematics. Students applying to SUMaC should have experience writing and reading mathematical proofs and strong mastery of high school geometry and algebra. Familiarity with number theory and modular arithmetic is suggested.

##### Application Deadline

Monday, February 2, 2026 at 11:59 pm Pacific Time

##### Admissions Notification

Mid-April 2026

We receive many more qualified applicants for this small program than the space we have available. The residential program will serve 40 students and the online program will serve 64 students. Applicants should consider these program sizes when selecting whether they would like to be considered for the residential, online, or both SUMaC offerings.

# Admissions Overview

Students in grades 10 and 11 at the time of application submission are eligible to apply. Participants who will be 18 years or older during the program are not eligible for SUMaC residential but are eligible for SUMaC online.

#### Course Selection

Students will be asked to rank their preference of the two available courses, Program I and Program II, on the application.

#### Review Process

Applications will be reviewed by our admissions team. If offered admission, an applicant is admitted into one course determined to be the best fit, taking into consideration applicant course preferences, and overall suitability and preparation for the course.

#### Notification of Admissions Decision

Once an application is complete, the applicant will be notified of our admissions decision on the notification date. Decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

# Selection Process

***Admissions is competitive.***We receive many more qualified applicants for this small program than the space we have available. The residential program will serve 40 students and the online program will serve 64 students. SUMaC students are selected based on their grades in math courses, their teacher recommendation, their passion for mathematics as demonstrated in their essays and other parts of the application, their prior engagement with math both inside and outside class, and their performance on the SUMaC admission exam.

Using the factors described above to determine the best fit, the Admissions Committee will place each admitted student in either the Program I course or Program II course. Most applicants accepted to Program II are very familiar with the material covered in Program I through prior participation in SUMaC or other study.

The admission exam is a collection of challenging proof-based math problems for applicants to work on at home over an extended period before the application deadline. If you are not familiar with the type of problems on the admissions exam, we invite you to consider applying to our Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes math courses: Number Theory or Discrete Mathematics. These courses will take place online. Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes requires a different application from SUMaC, but you can use the same account to begin and submit your application. **The deadline to apply for Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes courses is March 13, 2026.**

# Application Process

In order to evaluate an application, we must collect personal information about the student and their parents and legal guardians. Parents and legal guardians are required to submit the application with their minor student. Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies defines a minor as a student that has not reached the age of 18 years old.   
  
**Before families start the student’s application**, they should review the [**Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies Applicant Privacy Notice**](https://sumac.spcs.stanford.edu/applicant-privacy-notice) that explains how we collect, use, disclose and process their information. By starting the application, parents and legal guardians are consenting to the collection of their student’s data and the parent or legal guardian’s data described in our privacy notice.

[Applicant Privacy Notice](/applicant-privacy-notice)

### 2. Start an Application

Create a Stanford University Mathematics Camp application account. The application account should be made with the student applicant's legal name, though a parent and legal guardian email address may be used to receive application communications.

The residential SUMaC program is only open to students currently in grades 10 or 11, and who will be minors (younger than 18 years old) during the program. The online SUMaC program is only open to students currently in grades 10 or 11, and who will be 18 years old or younger during the program.

### 3. Review Application Checklist

In addition to the online application form, a complete application includes:

* **Academic Records**  
  We require unofficial transcripts for each school or academic program from which you earned grades (such as letter or numerical grades) from Fall 2023 through Fall 2025. If you have multiple grade reports from one school, combine them into a single file for upload. Homeschooled applicants should submit a document similar to a transcript with their coursework from the years listed above. Homeschooled students should also submit transcripts from any graded courses they took with a school or program during this period.
* **Teacher Recommendation**  
  We require one online recommendation form from a math teacher.
* **Optional Video Essay**  
  The video essay is an opportunity to share more about your interest in our program. You can consider it a conversation between you and our Admissions Committee. If you attend a school in which the primary language of instruction is a language other than English, we **strongly encourage** you to complete the video essay.
* **$65 Application Fee**  
  You may submit the $65 application fee online using a credit card. See instructions for payment at the end of the Online Application. Fee waivers can be provided if qualifications are met. To request a fee waiver, complete the application fee waiver form linked in the admissions application.

### 4. Check Your Application Status

Return to the Application Status and Materials Checklist page to make sure all of your application materials have been submitted. When your admissions decision is ready, you will receive an email notification that prompts you to log in to this page for the decision.

### Financial Aid

Financial aid is granted based upon demonstrated financial need. Students who wish to be considered for both partial and full financial aid awards should submit a complete online financial aid application and all required income documentation. Submit your financial aid application by the financial aid application deadline, usually one week after the admissions application deadline.
