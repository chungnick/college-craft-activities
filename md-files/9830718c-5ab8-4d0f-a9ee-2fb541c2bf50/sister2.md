# Financial Aid

Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies is committed to making our programs accessible for students around the world. We believe finances should not create obstacles to world-class, pre-collegiate education. Financial aid is granted based upon demonstrated financial need. Aid is open to all applicants and applying for financial aid does not have an effect on your admissions decision.

#### Who Should Apply

If the tuition cost is a barrier, we encourage you to apply for financial aid. Be sure to include any relevant clarifications of your family's circumstances in your Parents’ Financial Statement. Aid can be awarded to both domestic and international participants.

#### When to Apply

Applicants must submit their financial aid application by Monday, February 9, 2026.  
  
The financial aid application fee is $60 USD. Fee waivers can be provided if qualifications are met. To request a fee waiver, complete the application fee waiver form linked in the admissions application.

> Being here has changed my life because it made me realize that no matter what my background is that I can make it, and that I can become what I want to be, I can make it to Stanford someday or some other school and do something amazing regardless of where I come from.
