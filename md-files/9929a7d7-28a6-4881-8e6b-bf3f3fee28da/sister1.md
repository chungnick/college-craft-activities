## How can we live and work together in space?

**The NSS Space Policy and Universalization (spUN) Debates** offer international students an opportunity to form a global team to debate space policy with an eye on Universalization – finding solutions, through world-wide collaboration and cooperation, for the space industry and here on Earth.

**The space policy and universalization (spUN) Debates** began in 2017. The High School Program is 100% virtual as teams of 4 debaters (ages 14 -18) come together from different parts of the world and  learn to work together and appreciate different perspectives, cultures, and languages while learning the art of debating important space policy issues. Debaters report its tons of fun on an international level!

**Past high school resolutions:**

* Can universalization promote global peace through cooperation?
* Space development contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
* Money spent on space exploration is not justified when there are so many problems here on Earth that we need to solve first.
* The Gateway will be critical in expanding human presence to the Moon and deeper into the solar system.
* Space traffic management should be regulated by the UN Security Council.
* Space development would best be performed by autonomous AI and robotic systems.

We are people from around the world dedicated to the creation of a spacefaring civilization. We are an independent nonprofit nonpartisan educational membership organization.
