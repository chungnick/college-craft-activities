## Who governs space development, security and ownership?

**NSS presents the University spUN Debate Program**, inviting university students worldwide to join a debate team. This is a 100% virtual opportunity!

**The NSS Space Policy and Universalization (spUN) Debates** offer international students an opportunity to delve into space topics and issues that need attention now, as technology is being built. Students form a global team of three– finding solutions through world-wide collaboration and cooperation for the space industry benefiting on and off world.

**The University spUN Debates began in 2022** at the university level. The program brings together teams of 3 debaters (enrolled in institutions of higher learning ) from all around the world to investigate and present the pros and cons of resolutions on space policy issues while learning to value different perspectives, cultures, and languages. The World Schools Championship Debate format is followed for these rounds.
