### Application Instructions for U.S. Applicants

Florida, Georgia, and Massachusetts select delegates through their state science fairs; Montana will choose one delegate through the state science fair and the other through the online application process. If you are from one of these states, please contact your [state’s selection coordinator](https://www.nysacademy.org/programs/nyscamp/contact-page-for-selection-coordinators/) for additional information. Delegates from the remaining 46 states and Washington D.C. please follow the instructions below to prepare and [submit your application](https://www.nysacademy.org/programs/nyscamp/2024-national-youth-science-camp-application/) for the 2025 NYSCamp.

We encourage you to submit your application with enough time for your recommender to be able to add the letter before the deadline.

### Eligibility Requirements and Application Instructions for International Applicants

In recent years the Office of Cultural and Educational Affairs at the United States Department of State has sponsored delegates from select nations in the Americas. The State Department selects these nations, and the selection coordinators choose delegates at the U.S. Embassy in each nation. Thus, each country processes applications differently. Please visit the [National Youth Science Camp Application (International Applicants)](https://www.nysacademy.org/nyscamp-information-for-international-applicants/) page to learn more information. Reach out to your State Department contact with any questions.

**International delegates for the 2025 National Youth Science Camp will be from: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago**. Applicants must:

* If you are a resident of one of the countries selected to send delegates (noted above)**,** then you must be 16, 17 or 18 years of age on July 1, 2025, have strong skills in spoken English, and be eligible for a J-1 Visa to enter the United States. *Do not apply for a J1 Visa at this time; if selected, the U.S. Embassy in your country will provide assistance.*
* You must have documented superior academic proficiency, including recognition in mathematics or the sciences.
* You must have documented leadership abilities and social maturity through involvement in school or community activities.
* You must have documented skills and achievements outside the realm of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and outside the realm of academia.
* You must demonstrate a curiosity and an eagerness to explore many and varied topics.
* You must intend to pursue higher education and a career in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics related field.
* You must be willing and able to participate in the entire NYSCamp program.
* Proficiency in English is necessary, as the program is conducted in English. Proof of English proficiency is required to apply to the National Youth Science Camp. In the application form, please attach a copy of your TOEFL, IELTS, CAE, or CPE (or equivalent) test scores here; for more details or questions about English proficiency, please [reach out](https://www.nysacademy.org/nyscamp-information-for-international-applicants/) to the selection coordinator via email with specific questions, as the measurement methodology may vary between countries.
* Must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or willing to test prior to traveling to camp. Official documentation of vaccination status will be requested to be submitted if selected to attend the NYSCamp to determine testing needs.

### Delegate Selection

Delegates are selected by representatives appointed by the Governor of their state or by the U.S. Embassy in their nation.

Most U.S. delegates will be notified of their selection on or before Monday, April 1, 2025 by their State Selection Coordinator. Selected delegates will receive an official invitation from the National Youth Science Camp by April 5, 2025, and will be expected to commit to attending the full NYSCamp and fill out delegate paperwork by April 15, 2025.

**If you are selected as a delegate from your state, you must confirm your attendance and fill out camp paperwork by April 15, 2025 to ensure your spot is not given to an alternate.**

### Delegate Participation

Since selection to attend camp is a very competitive process with only two delegates guaranteed a spot from each state or nation, we expect NYSCamp delegates to fully participate in both the camp. We expect all delegates to be fully present 24/7 during the 3 weeks of in-person camp. **The camp is located in the Monongahela National Forest, which is near the National Radio Quiet Zone, which means there is spotty mobile phone service. Please do not plan to take internships, online college classes, etc. during the NYSCamp as we are unable to provide the support needed to meet the deadlines of high-demand programs.**

Delegates will also have the opportunity, if they desire, to propose, plan, and present their own seminar during the camp.
