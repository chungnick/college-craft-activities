## STEM Summer Internship Program

The Griffin Spalding County School System STEM Summer Internship Program is an extension of school-based curriculum into the workplace. Through this experience, students are exposed to a wide range of general workplace knowledge and competencies, with the goal of better preparing students for future career opportunities. This program is apart of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Advanced Manufacturing & Prototyping Integrated to Unlock Potential (AMP-IT-UP) Georgia Tech Project in an effort to increase the number of high school students in Griffin-Spalding County pursuing STEM careers. Internships provide students with academic qualifications and real world experiences that will set them apart during the postsecondary application process, regardless of where they are planning to attend a college, university or technical school.

If accepted, students will spend four weeks, 35-40 hours each week, working in a local business in the summer. Employers determine hours and weeks of work, and the student intern will be paid $7.25 per hour. It is the parents’ responsibility to ensure transportation for the student for the duration of the internship. Each student intern will conduct a presentation of their internship experience on a date and at a location to be determined later.
