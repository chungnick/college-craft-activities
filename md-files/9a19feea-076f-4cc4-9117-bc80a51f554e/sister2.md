### What Do I Need to Know About Parking & Transportation?

Things to know if traveling to UO campus from outside of the Eugene area:

* SAIL does NOT provide parking or transportation to and from programs. Please plan to drop off and pick up your student at designated times and locations, or use alternative options such as bike, bus, etc.
* If arriving by car, drive slowly on the UO campus and follow parking directions. Campus transportation checks parking regularly and will issue tickets. The university has hourly pay-to-park areas located around campus at a rate of $2.00 per hour. Payment can be made at conveniently located kiosks which accept Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, Discover, U.S. bills, and quarters. Payment can also be made with a mobile device through the [Parkmobile](https://app.parkmobile.io/zone/start) app/website. Please make sure you have ample time on your meter and park only in marked stalls when dropping off or picking up your student.

### What Are the Student Expectations, Policies, & Behavior Management?

SAIL is committed to ensuring that YOU, the student, feel safe during your experience at SAIL. The program has developed expectations that will be enforced throughout SAIL programs, which will allow SAIL to provide you with the best experience possible.

The University of Oregon affirms and actively promotes the right of all individuals to equal opportunity in education and employment at this institution without regard to race, color, sex, national origin, age, religion, marital status, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, this includes all protected characteristics from discrimination under Oregon law, ORS 659A.030. inclusive environment and non-discrimination policies. If parents/guardians or youth are uncomfortable with these policies, they may choose to limit their own participation.

#### University Code of Conduct

As a university-sponsored program, we (employees) and you (parents/guardians and student participants) are bound by the University CODE OF CONDUCT. Under this code, the University of Oregon may initiate disciplinary action and sanctions imposed against any student found guilty of committing, attempting to commit, or intentionally assisting in the commission of any of the following prohibited forms of conduct:

Students are not allowed to use their cell phones during the program. Due to the level of engagement, we foster at SAIL and out of respect for faculty and volunteering their time, we will not allow the distraction of cell phones. Not only can cell phone use be a distraction, but it can also lead to unwarranted cyber-bullying. We respect the fact that this may be a difficult challenge for both parents/guardians and students, however, we believe in the benefits of a no cell phone policy. We would like our SAIL students to focus on building relationships with new peers rather than isolating themselves on electronic devices. If you have an urgent need to get in contact with your student, you may contact our SAIL office phone number, 541-346-4668, and we will get a message to your student and/or have them return your call.

Day students will be asked to silence their phones at the start of every day and their phones must be put away until the day program is over. If a staff member continually catches a student on their phone, they will take it for the remainder of the day and give it back at check out. **If you have an urgent need to get ahold of your student, you may contact our SAIL office phone number, 541-346-4668, and we will get a message to your student and/or have them return your call.**

#### Dress Code Policy

Student participant attire adds to the success of our student learning environment. Students need comfortable clothing that is functional for warm days, and cool classrooms. Comfortable walking shoes are important as we walk around the UO campus a great deal. Sandals and flip-flops are not recommended. Programs that include time in labs will require closed-toed shoes.
