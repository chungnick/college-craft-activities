# Mark Cuban Foundation AI Bootcamp

> The future global competitiveness of our country depends on having as many AI literate people as possible. I think there is an untapped wealth of knowledge and innovation in underserved communities.
>
> —**Mark Cuban**, entrepreneur and founder, Mark Cuban Foundation

The Mark Cuban Foundation AI Bootcamp is an opportunity for high school students to immerse themselves in artificial intelligence and machine learning. No prior experience with coding is required for participation.

With AI being a relevant topic on many news sources, students will learn what artificial intelligence is and is not, where they already interact with AI in their own lives, and the ethical implications of AI systems including, but not limited to, TikTok recommendations, smart home assistants, facial recognition, and self-driving cars. Participants will also learn how Large Language Models like ChatGPT are changing life as we know it by answering questions, telling original stories, and even writing computer code.

The AI Bootcamp is held over four consecutive Saturdays in the fall at Carnegie Learning. Over the course of the four five-hour-long sessions, students will:

* identify AI in the real world
* build their own application
* discuss AI ethics and bias in data
* meet and learn from AI experts

The AI Bootcamp is open to students who:

* live and attend high school (grades 9–12) in the Pittsburgh region
* have an interest in technology and machine learning
* can attend in person

> AI and algorithms are shaped by the individuals who create them, so if we truly want to move toward a more equitable future, we need to have a diverse group of individuals involved at every step in the development process.
