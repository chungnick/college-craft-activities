## You can’t be future ready without being community ready

The Readiness Institute Summer Discovery is a transformative experience that equips rising high school seniors in Bedford, Blair, Cambria, and Somerset counties with vital skills and knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving world. Over several weeks, students engage with industry professionals, community organizations, Penn State leaders, and their peers through interactive skills workshops, field trips, group projects, and real-world learning opportunities to create personalized road maps for future success.

**Note on Pittsburgh programming:** While Summer Discovery continues in Central Pennsylvania as an intensive summer experience, the Readiness Institute is expanding its Pittsburgh programming into a year-round experience that provides long-term exploration of career, college, and civic pathways. **More details will be shared soon.**

> Before the Readiness Institute, I didn’t really know who I was. However, through the [Summer Discovery] activities, I was able to realize my potential and understand who I am now and who I want to be. I think I can speak for everyone when I say that our lives are better because of it. I know mine certainly is.
