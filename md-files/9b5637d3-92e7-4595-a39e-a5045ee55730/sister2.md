# Financial Aid Services

Your UMass Dartmouth education is an investment in your future. We can help you finance your education through a variety of programs—from grants and scholarships to loans and student employment.

## Get started

While there is no deadline to applying for financial aid at UMass Dartmouth, the university awards institutional funds on a first-come, first-serve basis. Students who file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) using our school code (002210) by April 1 are given priority for all funds available. After April 1, awards will be on a funds-available basis.

You are encouraged to file your FAFSA as early as possible for maximum aid. Keep in mind that many private and state programs use March 1 as the FAFSA deadline for applying. Please check with your private or state program filing requirements and deadlines. If this is your first time applying for aid, you may want to calculate your estimated cost of attendance with our net price calculator.
