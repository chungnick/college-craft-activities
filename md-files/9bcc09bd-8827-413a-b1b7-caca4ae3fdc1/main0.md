## High School

2026 MERITS Program is now OPEN!

**APPLICATION DUE DATE IS February 13, 2026**

Our Maine Research Internships for Teachers and Students (MERITS) Program provides summer (six weeks) research opportunities to Maine high school juniors in host institutions across the state.  Students who are interested in STEM fields and would like to experience “real-time” applications of STEM in a research-focused work world conducting research and technology development should apply.

Our MERITS interns are paid a stipend for their six-week summer research experience**.**

Students must be U.S citizens, residents of Maine and must be enrolled as a Junior at a Maine school to apply to this program.
