Our summer academic sessions offer diverse courses across multiple disciplines, allowing students to progress toward their degrees, explore new fields or tackle challenging subjects. Smaller class sizes and an intensive format foster close collaboration with faculty and peers, enhancing the learning experience. Want to explore psychology or sociology, creative and performing arts, or natural and lab sciences? Interested in computer programming, American history or public speaking? Summer at William & Mary is for you.

### Who Can Take Summer Courses

Classes are open to all current W&M students. Others may [apply](/as/undergraduate/more-pathways/summer/registration/index) to take classes as "non-degree-seeking" students: the credits you earn at W&M can be transferred to another institution; or, if you transfer to W&M, the credits will count toward your W&M degree.
