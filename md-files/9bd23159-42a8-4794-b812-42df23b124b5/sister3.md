The State Council of Higher Education provides Virginia Colleges and Universities with institutional tuition and fee data on their [Guide to the Tuition and Fees Reports](https://research.schev.edu/apps/info/Reports.Guide-to-the-Tuition-and-Fees-Reports.ashx) website.

The university reserves the right to provide some or all instruction and related academic activities through alternative delivery methods, including remote delivery. It also reserves the right to change the delivery method before or during an academic term in the event of a health or safety emergency or other circumstance when it determines that such change is necessary or in the best interests of the campus community. Tuition and mandatory fees will not be reduced or refunded if the university changes the delivery method for any or all of an academic session.

Suppose significant, long-term changes in instructional delivery are made. In that case, potential reductions in fees for auxiliary services, including housing and dining services, will depend on the university’s need and ability to continue operating, maintaining, and providing access to those services and the timing of events triggering the changes.

## Educational Assistance

William & Mary has [Employee Educational Assistance](/offices/uhr/benefits/other/educational-assistance/index.php) that permits eligible faculty and staff to take advantage of educational opportunities. Participation in the program is by approval only. Please refer to the [Employee Educational Assistance Policy](/offices/ce/policies/financial-operations/employee-educational-assistance.php) for specific details.

## Domicile at William & Mary

To be eligible for in-state status, an individual (or the parent, legal guardian or spouse who provides financial support) must demonstrate residence in Virginia and an intent to remain in Virginia indefinitely to establish domicile in Virginia, then maintain domicile in Virginia for at least 12 months preceding the first day of classes. Please visit [University Registrar’s Domicile](/offices/registrar/student-records/in-state-residency/index.php) page for source documents and complete information.
