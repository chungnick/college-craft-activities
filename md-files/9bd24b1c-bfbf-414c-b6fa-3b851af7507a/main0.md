# Forensic Science Camps

## Forensic Institute

Learn what it takes to solve crimes! Through fun, hands-on activities, you'll learn how to collect evidence from a crime scene, analyze clues, and understand how the criminal justice system works. You'll get to experience what it’s like to be a detective, solving puzzles and uncovering mysteries, all while developing important problem-solving skills. It’s the perfect adventure for young detectives who are ready to learn and have fun!

### CSI Kids

Throughout the week, we will observe how Forensic Scientists analyze a crime scene. Campers will use their knowledge and detective skills to investigate crimes. They will be focusing on specific analyzing skills of different types of evidence, such as fingerprints and blood splatters! Campers will work together through self-expression developing social skills and creativity in many group challenges. Group activities throughout the week will assist the students in building their skills in problem-solving, and taking on real-world challenges. Campers will study Forensics Science through multiple Lab skills including: Observation and Crime Scenes, Blood Spatters, Fingerprints, Hairs, and Fibers.
