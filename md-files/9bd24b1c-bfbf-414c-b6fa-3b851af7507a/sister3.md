This discount cannot be combined with any other discount offers.

*How to use the discount codes:*

*Terms of Cancellation*

If Penn State Abington has to cancel a program, the amount refunded to the family will be equivalent to the value of a program with the discount applied (i.e. if total registration fee for 2 programs was $538 and the discounted cost was $528. the total amount refunded for one program would be $264.)

If the participant requests a cancellation of their registration, the amount refunded will be equivalent to the value of the program with the discount applied (see above example) and is subject to an administrative fee.
