What age group or academic level are these courses for?

* These courses are designed for high school or U.S.-high-school-equivalent students, including those who are taking a “gap year” between high school and college. Students should be 13 and up, not yet enrolled in college, and no more than 1 year post-high school graduation (“gap year”).

Will these courses work with my schedule? What if I have other commitments during the course?

If you aren't sure which dates are best for you, we recommend that you enroll in the cohort most likely to work and switch later if needed.
