## American Rocketry Challenge

The American Rocketry Challenge, the world’s largest student rocket competition, has engaged over 100,000 middle and high school students in model rocketry. The challenge provides a yearlong opportunity to gain hands-on engineering experience by designing, building, testing, and launching model rockets to meet rigorous requirements. The program fosters leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills as students deepen their interest and passion for aerospace and STEM.
