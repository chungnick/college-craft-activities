## About the 2026 Summer Child Health Research Internship

The Department of Pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and the Colorado Child Health Research Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado host a summer research program for high school seniors over the age of 18, college students, graduate students and first-year medical students. Students will work in the lab with members of the Department of Pediatrics faculty at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado on the [Anschutz Medical Campus](/locations/anschutz-medical-campus-aurora/).

The summer program will introduce students to research opportunities related to child health. This includes opportunities for students to participate in a weekly lecture research series as well as present their research at the completion of the internship.
