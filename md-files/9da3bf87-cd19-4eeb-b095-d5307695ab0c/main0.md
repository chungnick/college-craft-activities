Please note the following: You may only attend SSTP once. Due to the large number of SSTP applicants, questions about your application may not be answered immediately. We answer all correspondence in the order we receive them. We process inquiries as quickly as possible but recommend completing your SSTP application in advance of the deadline to avoid encountering issues at the last minute that may impact the timely completion of your application. Inquiries submitted 1–2 days prior to the SSTP application deadline may not receive a response until after the deadline has passed.

### Daily Schedule

As a student in SSTP, you will be a registered student at the University of Iowa and will receive 3 semester hours of credit for successful completion of the program. During your time on campus, you will be working with your research group 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. Central time, Monday through Friday with required evening activities including yoga, improv and seminars.

On Tuesday and Wednesday nights from 6 p.m. – 7 p.m. you will be attending seminars to guide you through SSTP with readings and assignments. Additionally, students will have planned weekend activities. SSTP students will be supervised by the program staff for all activities.

In addition to academic programming, you will be able to participate in a variety of scheduled recreational activities selected by the staff. You will also have access to the University of Iowa libraries, computer facilities, and study areas.
