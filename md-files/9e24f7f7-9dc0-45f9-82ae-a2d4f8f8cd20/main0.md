# Precollege Academic Campus Experience (PACE)

[Apply for PACE](https://reg.cerc.wisc.edu/HpHEDmC7/5a1bHpM7OtK)

The PACE program gives **students finishing grades 4–8** an opportunity to explore their current interests and passions with like-minded peers in a college setting. Students will spend one week taking an enrichment course designed specifically for advanced middle-school learners. Three week-long sessions are offered. Students may enroll in one or multiple sessions. [Scholarships](https://precollege.wisc.edu/financial-information/) are available.

Learn more about the application process below.

## Why PACE

PACE offers the opportunity to engage your academic interests in a college setting. During class, don’t be surprised if you lose track of time geeking out on your favorite subject while facing unique academic challenges. In the classroom, you will become a more independent learner and increase your confidence when approaching challenging academic tasks, both individually and in teams.

By the end of the program, you will develop better time management skills and improve your understanding of yourself, your strengths, talents and areas where you can continue to grow. When you are not in class, be ready to explore different parts of campus, which may further spark your curiosity!

Overall, PACE will help you feel more comfortable and confident sharing your ideas with a broad community of intellectually motivated peers.

### Admission Questions

Please [use this form](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BPC-Middle-School-App-Form.pdf) to answer the following questions in 4-6 sentences. Take time to answer these questions thoroughly as they will be reviewed by the admission committee and will be used for decisions about program admission, class placement, and consideration for scholarship (if you apply for a scholarship, please review the information in the next tab).  Please know your responses may be shared with your course instructor.

* Why do you want to participate in this program?
* What interests you about your course selection(s)?
* Could you tell us about an accomplishment you are proud of? (This could be school, sports, hobbies, personal goals, etc.)

Then, in 1-2 sentences, please answer the following questions:

* Tell us what you like to do. For example, what are your favorite subjects to study and/or activities to participate in (in school or outside of school)?
* The most challenging thing I have had to do in school is…
* The most helpful thing a teacher has ever done for me is…

Students who participate in PACE typically have been successful and interested in classwork related to their course selection(s). They are motivated to attend an academic program focusing on one specific subject per week.

### Admission process

Each application is reviewed on a rolling basis by a committee which takes into consideration the student’s academic achievement and motivation for participation in their choice of course(s). The comittee will review the question responses, grade reports, and any supplemental materials submitted to demonstrate interest, achievement, or speak to extenuating cirumstances. The committee may request further information to make a determination.

After committee review, a student may be Admitted, Conditionally Admitted, or Denied. When a student is Conditionally Admitted, they may have been waitlisted or need to provide additional information for the Committee to make a final decision. Students will be given an amount of time to complete needed steps. Waitlists are generated on a first-come, first-served basis. If the student is unable to complete the additional steps or the additional documentation does not meet required standards, Badger Precollege reserves the right to determine when and how denial is communicated.

We are pleased to offer full and partial scholarships to students who participate in the Accelerated Learning Program on a first-come, first-served basis. Please review the information below to see if you qualify. At this time no scholarship assistance is available to international students. ***Funds available for scholarships are limited***and are distributed throughout the month of January-March on a rolling basis.

Prior to applying, a student may request a waiver for the application fee in writing to [info@precollege.wisc.edu](mailto:info@precollege.wisc.edu).

All materials supporting your application for scholarship assistance must be submitted with your application or received **within two weeks** of program application submission. Documents not included on the application can be sent to **info@precollege.wisc.edu**. **Application for scholarships should be received no later than  April 1, 2026.**We encourage you to submit scholarship information early to maximize your chances of receiving aid**. Please note that scholarships are awarded on a rolling basis, and funds may run out before the deadline.**

Please visit our [financial information page](https://precollege.wisc.edu/financial-information/) for more information and to review the full scholarship policy.

### Scholarship Application Process

**Full Scholarship:** Available to WI Residents Only

To qualify for a full scholarship you must:

* Receive free or reduced lunch in the state of Wisconsin during the current school year
* **Upload**a[Badger Precollege Scholarship Form](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2026-Scholarship-Form.pdf) to your online program application or to [PACE@precollege.wisc.edu](mailto:PACE@precollege.wisc.edu) with your school’s Authorized Representative signature (ex: Food Service Director, Principal, Counselor) and the checkbox verifying your free-reduced lunch status.

If you don’t qualify for a full scholarship or are not a resident of Wisconsin, you may qualify for a partial scholarship of up to 50% of the tuition cost.

**Partial Scholarships:**

To qualify for a partial scholarship you must:

* Provide an alternative document verifying income. For domestic students the recommended alternative is to submit the first page of the U.S.  1040 Tax Form of the most recent year’s tax return. For international students, please submit the first page of the Income Tax Report of the most recent year’s taxes.  For security purposes, all personal information like  Social Security or other identity numbers should be redacted before submitting the form. If extenuating circumstances (i.e. loans, loss of employment) are not reflected on tax return but are impacting your family’s finances, please also submit your financial need story.

Additional information (essay, interview, phone conversation, etc.) may be requested from students and/or families prior to notification of aid.

### Notification of Aid

Families will be notified of decisions via email. Badger Precollege is committed to making an allocation of financial aid funds to allow the largest possible number of students to attend our programs. Families will be required to submit their intent to accept financial aid. Failure to do so by the deadline posted in your award letter may result in a loss of partial or full aid award.

### PACE FAQs

#### Where is the program located?

The PACE Program is located on the beautiful UW Madison campus. Our students eat lunch at Gordon Commons, located on the SE side of campus (770 W Dayton St.) and classroom locations are within walking distance to Gordon Commons. Badger Precollege works closely with UW Central Campus Reservations and individual building managers to secure space. This process takes time, as there are many other campus departments and programs scheduling space during the same blocks of time each summer. Individual classroom locations are not confirmed until late May at the earliest.

#### Is lunch provided during the program?

Yes, lunch for your student is provided as a part of the cost of tuition. Gordon Avenue Market is an undergraduate residence dining facility serving cafeteria style options that offers many food choices each day. Badger Precollege staff will be supervising your child and assisting them in making healthy food choices. If your child has any dietary restrictions or allergies we need to be aware of, please be sure to include this information in your CampDocs online health profile. If a student has severe food allergies or a very restricted diet, they are welcome to bring their own lunch. (Tuition is not prorated in cases where a student brings their own lunch.) A good resource that includes daily menus may be found [here](https://www.housing.wisc.edu/dining/locations/gordon/).

#### Will students be walking frequently?

PACE students often move between buildings on campus as part of their course and occasionally as a large group. This affords students the opportunity to explore just some of what the UW Madison campus has to offer. Please keep in mind that all field trips are walking trips around campus, with occasional use of the campus Metro route as needed. Venues are chosen based on their proximity to the southeast side of campus to accommodate students walking, as well as being mindful of the very hot temperatures which often occur during July. Students are supervised by a combination of Group Leaders, Instructors, and Badger Precollege Staff.

#### How do I request a late drop off or an early pick up during PACE?

Requests for late drop off and early pick up should be directed to the program manager/program coordinators. Advance notice is greatly appreciated.

While we try our best to accommodate requests, it is not always possible to accommodate specific times. The volume of requests we received increased tremendously over the past year, making this process more challenging. Our staffing numbers are based on a 1:10 staff to student ratio which we must maintain at all times.

Most PACE classes take some field trips during the instructional blocks, so picking up during those times may not be possible. This will vary between classes.

Requests to pick up in the middle of the lunch/field trip block cannot be accommodated, as all staff are needed to supervise, or we may be in transit during those times or already at a field trip location.

As a general rule, if your student has another commitment in the afternoon, we request that you pick up your student up at 11 a.m., following the morning instructional block, or at 1:30 p.m. once students have returned to class following the lunch block.
