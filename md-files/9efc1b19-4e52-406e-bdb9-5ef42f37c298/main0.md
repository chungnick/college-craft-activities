# NC State Livestock Science Camp

The summer camp experience expands students' knowledge of the livestock and agricultural industries and related careers.

[Contact Us](mailto:LivestockScienceCamp@gmail.com)

The NC State Livestock Science Camp is designed for high school students aged 15-18. During the camp, youth will engage with NC State students, faculty, and staff to explore animal science and learn more about the livestock and agricultural industries and related careers. **No previous livestock species experience is necessary.**

## Livestock Science Camp June 14-19, 2026

## Camp Life

You will learn about the vast field of agriculture and livestock production outside of the world of veterinary medicine and participate in many hands-on activities, including:

* Visits to the beef and dairy cattle, swine, sheep, goat and horse educational units
* Run laboratory experiments
* Attend farm and industry tours and hear from industry guests
* Explore the science, technology and biotechnology of livestock industries and the interaction of animal production and food safety
* Participate in leadership activities

And you’ll make many new friends from across North Carolina and beyond.

## Camp Preparation

There will be a Zoom information session prior to camp in early June to answer questions, introduce counselors and staff, and meet the campers. In mid-July 2026, we will host follow-up reflection and evaluation sessions.

## How to Apply

The camp is open to high school students, ages 15-17, who want to learn more about the livestock industry and potential career opportunities. No livestock background or experience is necessary, only a desire to learn.

Applicants will receive notification of acceptance and follow-up details for registration packets and payment by email.

**Applications are now open! [Click here to begin your application.](https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/YouthApplication?youthProgramID=CALS-LSC%202026)**

**The camp is limited to 40 participants. Apply through March 25, 2026 at 9 p.m. Selected applicants will be notified by April 10, 2026. Deposits will be due 1 week after notification of acceptance.**

## Camp Costs

The $900 camp fee for selected participants will include a five-night stay on campus, meals, field trips, supervision, and program materials. (No refunds are available after receipt of payment). There is a $25 application processing fee.

If selected, a camp deposit will be required to save your spot.

## Additional Camp Info

[## Scholarship Information](#ncst-accordion-item-0-0)

#### Sponsor a Camper or Support the Livestock Science Camp Program

Livestock Science Camp is a self-funded camp program. Each year, programmatic costs increase, making it difficult for some youth to participate. Please consider sponsoring an individual camper’s scholarship, or donating to the camp program as a whole.

Contact Dr. Carrie Pickworth at clpickwo@ncsu.edu for camper scholarship opportunities or donate today through: <https://give.ncsu.edu/?appealcode=UCGNW> (search for Livestock Science Camp Fund (012244/669645)]

[## What does the camp registration fee include?](#ncst-accordion-item-0-1)

#### Education

The camp fee covers educational resources and educator fees for hosting 5 days of programming, which will include guest speakers, industry tours, and farm and laboratory demonstrations. Some supplies will be sent to participants as well.

#### Leadership and Supervision

We employ about nine (9) NC State students for the Livestock Science Camp program. These young adults dedicate many hours in the spring to preparing the camp curriculum, coordinating unique events and experiences for campers, and working with faculty and staff. Additional faculty and staff support are covered for Livestock Science Camp coordinators on nine-month contracts. Counselors and staff are on duty 24 hours daily for camp participant supervision.

#### Safety

NC State University requires a minimum of one (1) staff member for every ten (10) participants for all residential programs with youth 15 to 17 years of age. Several counselors are first-aid certified each year to take care of general health care needs. The camp program also purchases a supplemental insurance policy to help cover out-of-pocket expenses in emergency medical situations.

A secondary transport vehicle is always available during Livestock Science Camp in case of an emergency.

#### Housing

Five (5) nights stay in a suite-style dormitory on NC State Campus. Typically there are two (2) campers per room in a suite with approximately eight (8) campers and 1-2 counselors. Rooms include two twin-size beds, a closet, a min-refrigerator, and a small microwave.

#### Meals

The Livestock Science Camp strives to provide a variety of food and ensure options are available to those with dietary restrictions.

**Breakfast:** Continental-style breakfast provided at the dorm by the Livestock Camp staff. Typically this includes a variety of cold cereals, breakfast bars, fruit, bagels, bread, peanut butter, jelly, microwavable breakfast sandwiches, juices, and milk.

**Lunch:** An all-you-can-eat buffet-style at one of the University Dining Halls. The meal typically includes a fresh salad bar, several hot entree selections, Howling Cow ice cream and milk, soft drinks and water.

**Dinner:** Options vary by day and location due to field trips. Typically dinners are “fast-food” style catered meals such as pizza, Chic-fil-A, Subway, etc.

**Snacks and Beverages:** The camp program strives to keep snacks such as granola bars, fruit snacks, etc. and an assortment of water and soda available to campers between meals during transportation times.

#### Additional Items

Each camper receives a camp T-shirt and a drawstring backpack.

#### Transportation

Additional staffing and emergency vehicles are available at all times to maintain ratios in case of an emergency.
