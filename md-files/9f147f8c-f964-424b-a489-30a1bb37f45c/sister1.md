# Frequently Asked Questions

Thank you for your interest in Project Scientist. Check out responses to the most frequently asked questions below. Don't see a response to your question? [You can contact us here](https://projectscientist.org/contact-us/).

**Who can participate in Project Scientist programs?**

We serve girls ages 4-18 from underestimated communities. While we focus on girls, Project Scientist is committed to serving children of all gender identities and expressions.

**Can boys join Project Scientist programs?**

Since its inception, Project Scientist has focused on creating programs for underrepresented gender identities, primarily, girls. We do so to help address the significant gender gap in STEM degrees and STEM careers. That being said, we are happy to serve students of all gender identities and expressions. 

**How can I enroll my child in your programs?**

We partner with title 1 schools, school districts, and nonprofit organizations to offer our programs to students. While we don’t take enrollments directly, you can fill out [our program interest form](https://projectscientist.formstack.com/forms/program_interest_form_1) to bring one of our Innovation Lab, Explorers Club and Scholars Circle programs to your school. Once we receive your form, we will be in touch about next steps. 

**What types of programs do you offer at Project Scientist?**

We offer three core student programs including Innovation Lab (ages 4-12), Explorers Club (ages 4-12) and the Scholars Circle program (ages 13-18) to empower girls\* from underestimated communities on their STEM education journey. Additionally, we also run the Project Scientist Elevated Institute, a professional development initiative by teachers for teachers. 

**Do you offer programs in Spanish?**

Yes, our Innovation Lab and Explorers Club programs are available in Spanish. Similar to our programs in English, we partner with dual-immersion schools in the US to offer our programs in Spanish. We also host programs in Mexico. 

**Do you offer scholarships?**

All our programs are tuition-free and offered at NO COST to students and their families. Our partnerships with STEM companies allow us to cover the cost of our programs. 

**How can I bring Innovation Lab or Explorers Club to my school, nonprofit or local community?**

Thank you for your interest! We would love to partner with you to bring our programs to your students. All we will need from you: 

* A minimum of 20 students
* Dedicated learning space equipped with wifi
* Monitor or screen
* Class facilitators
* Project Scientist will provide the teachers, lab kits, and fun among other support to run a successful program. Fill out this program interest form and a member of our team will contact you with next steps.

**How can I volunteer with Project Scientist?**

We believe it takes a village and are committed to providing our students with the mentorship and positive role models they need to pursue their STEM career dreams. Our volunteers are incredible women studying or working in STEM who support our expeditions, share their work with our students through virtual or in-person presentations or through our social media channels.

**Do you offer internship opportunities?**

At present we do not have a formal internship program since we do not have the funds to offer paid internships. However, if your university offers funding we are open to hosting interns on a case-by-case basis. Reach out to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with a resume and someone on our team will get back to you. 

**How well qualified are your teachers?**

Our diverse group of educators has many years of experience teaching STEAM. Project Scientist also gives them additional training and credentialing through our Elevated Institute on math educational techniques, along with gender and racially equitable teaching strategies. Our teachers are dedicated to engaging and inspiring girls from underestimated communities. 

**What is the difference between STEAM and STEM?**

STEM is the commonly used acronym referring to the broader fields or industry relating to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. STEAM, which stands for science, technology, engineering, **arts** and mathematics, refers to the explicit inclusion of arts as a more holistic approach to education. This approach acknowledges the importance of creativity in STEM innovation.
