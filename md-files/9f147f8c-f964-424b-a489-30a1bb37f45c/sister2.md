# 2025 Scholars Program!

### **Fall Theme: Brilliant Builders & Bold Breakers**

Get ready to tinker, design, and innovate! Each session, you'll take on a hands-on challenge: engineer an umbrella, build a shoe, design your own toy, create a robotic arm, explore how eyes work, and even invent something brand new to solve a problem! Through the Scholars Program, you'll discover the power of creativity and problem-solving while having tons of fun.

**Program Details:**

**Dates**: Every Sunday beginning September 7, 2025 - November 23, 2025

**Time**: 3:00-4:30pm PST | 5:00-6:30pm CT | 6:00-7:30pm EST

Project Scientist’s Scholars Circle (formerly Scholars Program) is an **interactive virtual or in-person STEAM Leadership program for teens ages 13–18** designed to build confidence, ignite curiosity, and empower their dreams. Through hands-on projects and opportunities to build their professional networks by connecting with inspiring role models, Scholars explore real-world opportunities and pathways in STEM. The program also fosters leadership, collaboration, and community—helping Scholars develop their voice and see themselves as innovative scientists and problem solvers.

**Key Features:** STEAM Curriculum & Materials | Training & Ongoing Educator Support | Real-World STEM Career Exploration and Role Model Connections | Flexible Program Facilitation | Virtual or In-Person | Students Ages 13-18 years

## The Project Scientist Difference

Our programs are available in English and Spanish

Our programs are facilitated by educators who are equipped with the knowledge, strategies, and confidence to foster spaces of belonging for girls\* in STEM.

One of the distinguishing features of our programs are our strong partnerships with STEM companies which allow us to take our students on STEM expeditions and give them the opportunity to interact with women role models.

Through intentionally engaging parents and caregivers we ensure that our students receive holistic support in their STEM education journey.

To date, we have provided nearly **135,000** STEAM education experiences, impacting over **27,000** girls from communities across the United States and Mexico.

# **Bring our program to your school or nonprofit**

Project Scientists partners with school districts, individual schools, nonprofit organizations and library systems to offer our Scholars Circle program. We provide curriculum, training materials for teachers, STEAM education kits for students and all the logistical support to run our programs.
