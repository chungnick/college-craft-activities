# Youth On-Campus and Online Workshops

## Film, Media, and Performing Arts Programs

During NYFA’s year-round programs, teens and kids can pursue their interests in the film, media, and performing arts. Through projects, exercises, games, and activities, students develop new skills in filmmaking, acting for film, screenwriting, photography, musical theatre, game design or 3D animation.

In these programs, students learn what it means to be a visual and (or) performing artist and storyteller while forming lasting friendships, creating their own unique content, and establishing their unique artistic voice.

We currently offer summer camps, as well as weekend, after-school, and online classes held during the academic year. These full-time day camps and part-time weekend programs are offered at our campuses and locations at NYFA New York, Los Angeles, and Florence, as well as our satellite locations in Paris and the Harvard University Summer Program. As our level-one camps are designed for students with all creative backgrounds, no experience is required to attend. Our level-two camps, offered to those who graduate from level one camps, introduce additional skills and projects.
