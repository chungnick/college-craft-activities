* **Research Immersion in Materials Science and Engineering (RIMSE)**

## RIMSE Summer Schools: Training Opportunities for Graduate Students, Undergraduate Students, Post-Graduate Trainees, High School Students, K-12 Educators, Visiting Scholars, and Researchers from Industry, Government, and National Laboratories.

***What is [RIMSE](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/)?*** RIMSE stands for ***Research Immersion in Materials Science and Engineering***. Sponsored by the U.S. [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) as part of the UC San Diego Materials Research Science and Engineering Center ([MRSEC](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu)), the [RIMSE Summer Schools](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/) are immersive, hands-on courses meant to prepare trainees to work in Materials Science and Materials Engineering research laboratories.  They generally run for 8 to 10-weeks each summer on the UC San Diego campus. The UC San Diego MRSEC currently runs three [RIMSE](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/) schools:

***Who can participate in RIMSE?*** The RIMSE schools are unique in that they blend researchers from a wide range of backgrounds and educational levels - your team may include local high school students, undergraduate students (including incoming UC San Diego transfer students and REU students), graduate students (including incoming UC San Diego PhD and MS program students), post-doctoral trainees, k-12 teachers (through the RET program), and visiting international scholars, industry researchers, or government laboratory researchers (through the Researcher in Residence program). The UC San Diego MRSEC does not consider race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and/or other protected categories as part of the application and selection process of any programs or initiatives.

***What are the Program Elements of RIMSE?*** Focused on materials science research in topics of interest to the [UC San Diego MRSEC](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu), each of the RIMSE Summer Schools are run by MRSEC faculty who serve as senior mentors and/or instructors. Each RIMSE begins with an intensive training in theory, techniques and laboratory methods, and includes  a capstone “Discovery Project”—an independent research project implemented by the trainee in a small team and under the mentorship of a current UC San Diego MRSEC researcher. Though each Summer School runs its own topical curriculum, they share common activities including:

* Training on several of the key analytical instruments used in materials science (in the [MRSEC Materials Characterization Facility](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/facilities/)).
* “Pathways” luncheon seminars given by academic, industry, and government laboratory scientists that give insights into STEM career paths.
* Professional development workshops (research safety, research ethics, science communication, information literacy, graduate school / career preparation).
* Team-building activities including nature hikes, beach days, a San Diego Padres baseball game, and a kayak tour of the La Jolla cove.
* A final projects day (oral presentation at the [UC San Diego Summer Research Conference](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/conferences/src/index.html) or a poster presentation).

Each school emphasizes different research aspects related to the MRSEC, including soft materials and biomaterials, self-assembled materials, and computational design, and they share a set of core training elements focused on: research-critical instrumentation (electron microscopy, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, x-ray and electron diffraction methods); integration of computational methods; critical laboratory safety and the safe handling of chemical, biological, and nanotechnological hazards; and research ethics.

***Dates:*** In Summer 2026, the RIMSE summer schools will run from Monday, June 22 through Friday, August 14, 2026 (8 weeks). Trainees have the option to extend their laboratory research participation for longer periods either before or after the formal training program, depending on the particular Summer School and participant category.

***Expectations of Participants:***Full-time commitment to immersive lab work and engagement in program activities (Monday – Friday, 9am – 4pm), including presentation at the [UC San Diego Summer Research Conference](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/conferences/src/index.html) (SRC) in mid-August.

***Application:*** The different participant categories have different application processes (see below). The deadlines vary by participant category. In addition to completing a registration form, you will be asked to select a [RIMSE](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/) school (and potential [MRSEC faculty](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/faculty/) mentor) that best fits your interests, and to submit the following application materials:

* Personal Statement
* CV/Resume
* Current Transcript (if applicable)
* 2 Letters of Reference - *It is recommended that you seek out academic recommenders (university/college faculty members, rather than your RA or your high school coach) who in their letters can address your accomplishments, skills, knowledge, scholarly dedication and suitability for undergraduate research. Be sure to contact recommenders at least 3-4 weeks in advance of the application deadline. Send thank you notes once recommendation letters have been submitted and follow up to let your recommenders know the outcome of your application.*

### 2025 RIMSE Summer Schools:

#### [Summer School for Silicon Nanotechnology](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/sssin/)

***Nanoscale silicon materials***The intellectual focus of this RIMSE Summer School is on preparing, characterizing, and exploiting the properties of photonic crystals, thin films, nanoparticles, and quantum dots prepared from mesoporous silicon. Technological touchstones for these materials include nanomedicine, drug delivery systems, chemical sensors, biosensors, in vivo imaging, taggants, batteries, photovoltaics, and thermoelectric devices. Led by Professor [Michael Sailor](https://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/), the course provides training on synthesis and characterization of these materials. If you have questions about the RIMSE Summer School on Silicon Nanotechnology, please contact Professor [Michael Sailor](http://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/msailor.html)

#### [Summer School on Predictive Assembly](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/summer-school-on-predictive-assembly/)

***A computational framework for rational materials design and development.***The intellectual focus of this RIMSE Summer School is on understanding how nanoscale building blocks can be assembled into functional, tunable materials that operate at the meso- to macroscales. Such materials are broadly relevant to energy, environmental sustainability, and human health problems. Led by Professor [Tod Pascal](http://cmp.ucsd.edu/), the course provides training on the computational aspects of the self-assembly problem—students will learn how to deploy high-performance computing to build predictive models that capture the chemical and physical complexities of mesoscale materials and the dynamics of their formation.  Students will be employ a multiscale theoritical framework to solving these problems, combining first-principles electronic structure calculations, atomistic and coarse-grained (CG) models. The structure and dynamics of these system will be explored by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations will be used to determine the long-term, thermodynamic behavior. Trainees will learn how to: (1) simulate assembly at atomistic, nanoscopic, and mesostructural scales; and (2) how to predict the properties of the resulting structures. If you have questions about RIMSE on PA, please contact Professor [Tod Pascal](http://cmp.ucsd.edu/?team=prof-tod-pascal).

#### [Summer School on Engineered Living Materials](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/summer-school-on-engineering-living-materials/)

***Exploiting biology in functional materials***The intellectual focus of this RIMSE Summer School is to engineer living systems to generate new polymeric materials. These composite materials can be responsive to diverse stimuli and are capable of generating complex, genetically encoded material outputs. Such materials can enable biosynthetic electronics, chemical threat decontamination, synthesis and/or delivery of therapeutics, and soft robotics, among other applications. Led by Professor [Jonathan Pokorski](http://www.pokorskilab.com/), the course offers an introduction to skills relevant to synthesis and fabrication of engineered living materials. Trainees will learn techniques to create materials at the living/non-living interface, including polymer chemistry, additive manufacture, and soft matter characterization. If you have questions about RIMSE on ELM, please contact Professor [Jonathan Pokorski](https://www.pokorskilab.com/team).
