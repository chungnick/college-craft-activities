# Summer School for Silicon Nanotechnology (SSSiN)

* **2026 Summer School for Silicon Nanotechnology (SSSiN)**

***a Research Immersion in Materials Science & Engineering (RIMSE) program of the UC San Diego MRSEC, a National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center***

**About the SSSiN:** The Summer School for Silicon Nanotechnolgy (SSSiN) is run by [Prof. Michael Sailor](http://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/msailor.html) in the [Silicon Nanomaterials Research Laboratory](https://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. The SSSiN is one of three Research Immersion in Materials Science & Engineering ([RIMSE](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/)) programs of the [UC San Diego MRSEC](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/). Begun in 2003, the SSSiN is an immersive workshop focussed on the synthesis, properties, and applications of silicon-based nanomaterials. It integrates participants from a wide variety of backgrounds and skill levels: high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, industry researchers, and university professors. As part of the RIMSE training program, it also serves as a “bootcamp” for selected students at the beginning of their MS or PhD degrees, for [MRSEC REU](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/reu/) (Research Experiences for Undergraduates), and for UC San Diego undergraduate participants. Course elements include lectures, hands-on laboratory training, and a capstone “Discovery Project”- an independent research project implemented by a team of trainees under the mentorship of a current research group member.

**Program Details:** Dates, application instructions, and deadlines are given at [mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse](https://mrsec.ucsd.edu/rimse/).
