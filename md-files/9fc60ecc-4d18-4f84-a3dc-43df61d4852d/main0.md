# BUGS Jr. Program

# **Bridge Undergraduate Science Jr. Program (BUGS Jr.)**

### ***An Immersive Summer Research Program for High School Students***

### We are training the next generation of students to surmount disciplinary boundaries, create professional networks, and engage in world-class research as they work to better understand the human body and human health.

## The 2026 BUGS Jr Program Update.

We appreciate the tremendous interest in the BUGS Jr Summer Research Program at the Bridge Institute at USC. We are currently working with our PIs to have the application available by the end of February 2026.

Please check our website again at that time to submit your application.  
If you have any urgent questions, feel free to email us at bugsprogram@usc.edu.

## Seeking Feedback from our BUGS/Jr Alumni

The information being collected in this survey is: (1) for statistical purposes for planned future funding applications with relevant agencies, (2) for use on our website, social media and other promotional materials – please make sure to indicate at the end of the survey your consent/non-consent for these purposes, and (3) to evaluate impact and allow us to rationally consider changes to improve the program in the future.

Thanks for your participation!

## HANDS-ON RESEARCH

The BUGS Jr Program runs concurrently each summer with a parallel program for undergraduates, [**Bridge Undergraduate Science Program**](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge-institute/bugs-program/), known as BUGS for short. Students in the BUGS Jr Program pair with a USC Faculty Member and the members of their laboratory, often graduate students or postdoctoral fellows, to perform hands-on research in state-of-the-art research labs at USC.

Students also benefit from weekly BUGS Jr Program activities, including campus tours, journal clubs, career symposia, technical panels and Bridge-sponsored peer community-building activities such as research seminars and multi-disciplinary social mixers.

Curious to learn the kind of research our previous BUGS have done? Get to know a few of our alumni in the BUGS Jr Alumni Focus, or peruse our list of alumni to see some of the people who participated before and the projects they worked on.

## EXPLORE DISCIPLINES

BUGS Jr is one of a few immersive U.S. programs that allows students to explore across scientific disciplines. A unique highlight of the program is the summer finale symposium (*the Saturday in August*) where BUGS Jrs  present their work to their scientific mentors, peers and family, as well as the university community in dynamic poster sessions that allow them to showcase their efforts from the summer research program.

## ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

If you are currently a high school student, or will be an incoming freshman during the upcoming school year, you are eligible to participate in the BUGS Jr Program. Students who will graduate from high school in Spring 2025 should apply to this BUGS Jr Program.

[*updated 3/24/2025*] **Only U.S. Citizens, permanent residents and students already in the U.S. on in a valid immigration status** are eligible to participate in the BUGS Jr Program. BUGS Jr is not registered or able to sponsor student visas for participation in the summer research program.

There is **no GPA requirement** to participate in the  
BUGS Jr Program.

## PROGRAM DATES

##### **2026 BUGS Jr Program application portal will OPEN END OF FEBRUARY 2026**
