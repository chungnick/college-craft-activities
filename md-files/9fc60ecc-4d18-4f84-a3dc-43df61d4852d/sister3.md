# BUGS Jr Program FAQ for Faculty/ Mentors

[BUGS Jr Program FAQ for High School Students](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge-institute/bugs-jr-program-faq-for-high-school-students/)

* Am I eligible to be Faculty Mentor in the BUGS Jr program?

  Any USC faculty member who conducts research in an area that connects to better understanding the human body at USC and its affiliated organizations is eligible.

  Beginning 2025, all potential Faculty Mentors are required to register for the program (by April 18, 2025).

  [**https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_9Yqvl60aMkYbGN8**](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Yqvl60aMkYbGN8)

  Registration does not commit you to participating, but will be used by the BUGS Jr admissions committee in their decisions about pre-arranged or potential new mentor-student matches. Our priority will be to make both impactful and informed matches, and to ensure mentor and programmatic capacity to include a selected student. You (as the host/mentor) will be notified and have an opportunity to accept or decline the match/participation before a student is notified.

  See “**What else do I need to know?**” below:

  + - * You will be required to complete annual training for the protection of minors/youth (online).
      * You will be required to clear a background check through LiveScan (fingerprinting). This is a one-time requirement (not repeated annually), once cleared you should not have to repeat while you remain employed at USC.
      * You will be required to have at least one other adult (collaborator or member of your lab) actively co-mentor the student with you [and they must complete the same training and background checks]). This is to adhere to USC’s policy prohibiting private/one-on-one interactions between an adult and minor/youth.
* What kind of research is eligible for the BUGS Jr program?

  Any research that connects with understanding the human body and human health is eligible. This is defined in a broad sense and includes studies of biomedical materials, instruments or methods development, computational or animal models of disease, cinematic investigations of scientific data or methods, as well as human health topics. *Research projects in geology, plant science, green energy, astronomy, marine science, etc. are NOT eligible for participation in the BUGS Jr program.*

  ***Note:***

  ***Per Department of Animal Resources (DAR)/IACUC policy, students must be at least 18 years old to participate in work with animals, even if accompanied by an adult/Principal Investigator.***

  + ***Per USC Keck policy, students must be at least 17 years old to observe patient care in the hospitals or licensed clinics.***
  + ***Per IRB policy, there are NO age restrictions related to research participation on IRB-associated studies.***
* What research modes are allowed in the BUGS Jr program?

  All projects are conducted in person at USC and affiliated campuses, with an allowance for some hybrid (partly online; partly in person) participation.

  Strictly virtual/online-only projects will NOT be included in the 2025 BUGS Jr Program.
* When is the program offered?

  The BUGS Jr program typically runs from mid-June through the first Saturday in August (~7 weeks). The program culminates in a finale summer symposium at which the students present their research results in a poster session; symposium attendees include faculty/mentors/colleagues, as well as fellow students and family members/guests. We hope you will attend and participate in the symposium too.
* What are the costs to me (as a faculty/ mentor) to host a student in the program?

  All student participants in the BUGS Jr program receive an $800 stipend for their summer work. Faculty will be asked to support this cost from their own research funds; if faculty are unable to support the full cost of the stipend, applications will be reviewed by the BUGS Jr admission committee and a limited number of faculty-student pairs will be selected to receive an award through the Bridge-administered sources of fellowship support for high school students. Additionally, all participating faculty members must support the related materials/supply expenses needed to conduct the proposed research.
* What is the timeline for the 2025 BUGS Jr program?

  **Friday, April 18, 2025:** (Student) BUGS Jr Applications due via Qualtrics.  
  Students (and their Parent/Guardian) will automatically receive an email via Qualtrics confirming the application submission. Any updates or changes to the submitted application should be emailed to [bugsprogram@usc.edu](mailto:bugsprogram@usc.edu) and NOT submitted as a new application.

  **by Friday, April 18, 2025:** BUGS Jr Faculty/Mentor Registrations due via Qualtrics

  **April 21-May 23, 2025:** our BUGS Jr Admissions Committee will be meeting to review applications and available research slots. They will contact faculty mentors to recommend appropriate admissions pairing prior to provisional acceptance decisions.

  **Full acceptance in the BUGS Jr Program is contingent upon:**

  + Satisfactory Completion of the USC General Laboratory Safety Training Course.
  + Return of completed BUGS Jr Student Contract Forms.
  + If the student is under 18 years of age, contracts must also be signed by parent/guardian.
  + Completion of CampDoc health and registration requirements. If the student is under 18 years of age, CampDoc materials must be provided by a legal parent/guardian.

  **Tuesday, June 17, 2025:** BUGS Jr Summer Research Program begins.

  **Saturday, August 2, 2025:** BUGS/BUGS Jr Summer Research Finale Symposium (schedule to be determined – students should be available for full period).
* What else do I need to know?

  You will be required to release the student from research activities to allow them to participate in mandatory weekly programmatic activities (planned for 2 hours, one morning each week).

  **Critical details about USC’s Working with Minors Policies (****[https://policy.usc.edu/protecting-minors/](https://policy.usc.edu/protecting-minors/ "https://policy.usc.edu/protecting-minors/")****):**

  + Because all one-on-one interactions between a Covered Activity (BUGS Jr Program) Staff person and a Minor must be observable and interruptible by another Covered Activity Staff member (except under emergency circumstances), you must identify *at least one* additional lab member (faculty, staff, postdoc, or grad student) to participate with you in the research activities with the student for the duration of the summer program.
  + Faculty mentors (and their lab members) working with a child/minor (<18 yo) must complete (annual) USC mandated training for interacting with minors and reporting suspected child abuse or neglect. This training is available through **USC TrojanLearn.****You will be sent a link when we update our program registration though the Provost’s office.****.**
  + YOU (as “the” faculty mentor) have a “Duty to Report” knowledge or suspicions of child abuse or neglect. Specific information and instructions are outlined in the faculty contract.

  To comply with **[California Bus. & Prof. Code § 18975](https://casetext.com/statute/california-codes/california-business-and-professions-code/division-8-special-business-regulations/chapter-29-youth-service-organizations/section-18975-child-abuse-and-neglect-prevention#:~:text=Section%2018975%20%2D%20Child%20abuse%20and%20neglect%20prevention%20(a)%20An,child%20abuse%20and%20neglect%20reporting.)** (a new state law that went into effect on January 1, 2022), USC’s Protecting Minors policy requires that anyone who will have direct contact with minors in a covered activity undergo a fingerprint-based background check. As such, USC requires personnel working in covered activities to be screened through the Live Scan process.

  **Live Scan Instructions (for USC-sponsored covered activities only – NOT for third parties):**

  1. **[Review the instructions](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge-institute/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2023/03/LIveScanApplicationForm_BUGSJr.pdf)**for completing the Live Scan application form, which is the form you’ll need to bring with you when getting fingerprinted.
  2. Use the instructions as a guide to complete the prepopulated [**USC Live Scan application form**](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge-institute/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2023/03/BCIA-8016-Request-for-Live-Scan-Service-USC_FINAL-BUGSJr.pdf) and make 2 copies. Note that the pre-populated Live Scan application form cannot be used by third parties.
  3. To avoid paying fees out of pocket (does **not**apply to third parties), make an appointment at the following Live Scan location  
     – **[MR. Fingerprints](https://mrfingerprints.com/)** located at 617 S Olive St. Ste 807 Los Angeles, CA 90014; or  
     – Attend free, on-campus fingerprinting sessions with a Live Scan operator which are occasionally scheduled by USC. If you have a large group (50+), we can help schedule a visit specifically for your covered activity staff when possible.
  4. Bring the completed application form and a government-issued ID, such as a U.S. Driver’s License, U.S. passport or foreign passport with U.S. visa, to the Live Scan location.
  5. In the event these options do not accommodate your staff, they may choose another location; however, please note that reimbursement may not cover all associated fees, and/or there may be a delay in receiving funds. For alternative Live Scan locations, including associated fees, refer to the **[California Department of Justice’s Live Scan locator tool](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)**.
