# A real-world introduction to academic life at UCLA

## Gain the skills to succeed in university while earning college credit

The UCLA Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP) offers exceptional high school students the opportunity to experience a comprehensive introduction to college life while studying alongside UCLA undergraduates.

Designed to emulate the undergraduate experience, SCIP provides students access to a broad range of UCLA’s academic expertise and resources through lectures, workshops, and seminars, as well as UCLA coursework. SCIP’s co-curricular components are specifically curated to empower students to gain balance and thrive as they embark on their college journey.

Successful participants will come away from SCIP with college credit, a certificate of completion for the program, and the skills to successfully manage college applications, academics, and university life.
