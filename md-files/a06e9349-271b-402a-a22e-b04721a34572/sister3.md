## Fee Calculator

You may use the fee calculator below to estimate the cost of your attendance. For Summer Courses, Summer Online, or Summer Intensives, search for the courses you’d like to take either via our course/program search tool or the [UCLA Schedule of Classes](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC) and use the unit information of each course to estimate your total units.

Please note that the fee calculator is intended solely to help you plan your summer and only provides an estimate of your course or program fees, excluding other costs you may have such as housing cost, living expenses, textbooks, Course Materials fees, or miscellaneous fees that may apply.

The [Finances tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAa4lyy1Y3U&ab_channel=UCLASummerSessions) has an overview of fees, payment, deadlines, and more.

**PLEASE NOTE**: UCLA students who have been **dismissed, withdrawn, or graduated prior to the summer term** will be assessed **visiting** student fees.

DISCLAIMER

* Fees are calculated based on **student type and units**; there are NO additional out-of-state domestic student fees during the summer *(international students may incur additional fees i.e. health insurance).*
* UCLA students who have been **dismissed, withdrawn, or graduated prior to the summer term** will be assessed **visiting** student fees (including the $350 registration fee described below).
* A **$175 processing fee** is assessed when UCLA students drop all summer courses to 0 units ***starting April 15***. Dropping all courses prior to April 15 will not result in a processing fee. If a student re-enrolls in courses after the processing fee is assessed, it will be removed automatically from Bruin Bill.
* The **$350 registration fee** (and 2.75% service charge if paying by credit card) is ***non-refundable*** at all times.
* **Housing fees are included** in the program fee for ***residential Precollege Summer Institutes**.***
* Some or all instruction for all or part of the summer sessions may be delivered remotely. ***Tuition and fees are set regardless of the method of instruction***, and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the summer sessions.
* Figures for tuition and fees represent currently approved or proposed amounts and may not be final. Actual tuition and fees are subject to change by the University of California as determined to be necessary or appropriate. Final approved tuition and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.

## Financial Aid

### UCLA Students

Financial aid is available to all eligible UCLA students including students admitted to UCLA for fall quarter. To find out if you qualify for financial aid, please contact the **[UCLA Financial Aid Office](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/contact-us)**. For the most updated information about summer aid, please see the Financial Aid department’s [website](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/special-aid-programs/summer-aid).

If you will be receiving aid for the summer term, your aid will likely disburse before the payment deadline for summer. If your aid is delayed, but you have successfully submitted all required documents with your aid application, you may be placed on the **Protect from Drop list** and your courses will be saved from the drop for non-payment.

### Visiting UC Students

Eligible financial aid students from other University of California (UC) campuses may apply for financial aid at their home UC campus for summer study at UCLA. Please check with your home UC campus financial aid office for more information.

Note: If you plan to pay for classes with financial aid from your home university, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your sponsor, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines.

If your home UC campus financial aid office is unable to disburse your aid by the payment deadline, it is customary for your financial aid office to send UCLA a “Protect from Drop” list. **If you are still waiting for your aid to be disbursed, please check with your home UC financial aid office to see if you have been included in their protect-from-drop list.**

### High School Students

**CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS**

[**Summer Scholars Support**](https://summer.ucla.edu/student-types/high-school-students/scholarships/) – A needs- and merit based scholarship fund for current 9th-11th grade California high school students to participate in any of the following UCLA Summer Sessions offerings: Summer Courses, Summer Online, Summer Intensives, Precollege Summer Institutes, or the Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP). A limited number of full and partial scholarships will be awarded to selected recipients.

**[Bruin Ascent Summer Experience (BASE)](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/bruin-ascent-summer-experience-base/)** – A six week online scholarship program for current 10th-11th grade California high school students from economically under-resourced communities. Selected students will have the opportunity to enroll in one UCLA summer online course free of charge, to be paired with a UCLA undergraduate student mentor, and to participate in co-curricular workshops that will prepare them for their future endeavors in higher education!

**Precollege Summer Institutes Departmental Scholarships** – Some precollege summer institutes will offer program specific scholarships to qualified and selected high school students. Please visit the specific precollege summer institute page to see if they offer a departmental scholarship.

**OUT-OF-STATE OR INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS**

*\*UCLA financial aid is not available to visiting out-of-state high school students.*

While we do not offer scholarships for international or out-of-state students attending UCLA summer courses or programs, we highly encourage you to utilize the following scholarship search engines to explore financial aid opportunities which may be available to you. These scholarship search engines offer a wide variety of aid that are available for many different types of students. Please note that many of these scholarships will not fully cover the cost of your courses or programs; however, getting an early start on your scholarship applications can allow you to apply and possibly receive multiple scholarships. Utilizing these scholarship search engines is not only an excellent way for you to research ways in which you can fund your summer studies here at UCLA, but also is a great way to familiarize yourself with what funding opportunities may be available for your undergraduate studies.

* Add and drop deadlines

Refunds may take 1-3 weeks to process back to the same method that you paid with i.e. credit card, Bruin Direct, or check.

If you make any changes to your enrollment, check your BruinBill to verify changes in your balance before the [payment deadline.](https://summer.ucla.edu/calendar/key-academic-dates/) You are not relieved of financial responsibility if you fail to attend classes, reverse your credit card charges, stop payment on your registration check, or if the bank does not honor your check or credit card payment. **We do not offer auto payment or payment plans for summer fees.**
