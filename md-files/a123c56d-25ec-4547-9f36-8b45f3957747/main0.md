**APPLICATIONS FOR SPRING & SUMMER 2026 IS NOW AVAILABLE!**

The UC San Diego Department of Bioengineering, in collaboration with UC San Diego Extended Studies, offers a series of engaging courses designed for high school students interested in exploring the field of bioengineering. These courses emphasize experiential learning through interactive, hands-on laboratory activities.

## Course Progression

Students typically progress through the sequence beginning with BE-BOAT, followed by BE-ROW, and culminating in BE-SHIP. Students may have to take BERP-A and BERP-B, prior to taking BE-SHIP. Please view each course page for more information.

### BE-BOAT Courses

Winter and Summer 2026

### BE-ROW Courses

Spring and Summer 2026

### BE-SHIP Courses

Varies by Quarters

## BE-BOAT

The Bioengineering Broad Overview and Techniques (BE-BOAT) courses provide students with a comprehensive introduction to core scientific and engineering principles in bioengineering, complemented by hands-on experience using custom lab kits, pre-lab planning, data analysis, and post-lab discussions. These courses not only build foundational skills in experimental design and interpretation but also serve as preparation for advanced research opportunities through the Bioengineering Research (BE-ROW) course.

## BE-ROW

In the BioEngineering Research Orientation Workshop (BE-ROW) course, students collaborate with active researchers and work in teams to design and carry out a bioengineering research or design investigation from their home “lab,” building on foundational knowledge from a BE-BOAT course or by permission. Through structured project experiences in areas such as BioMechanics, BioImaging, and Tissue Engineering, students engage in the full research process—from literature review and study design to data analysis, scientific writing, and presentation.

## BE-SHIP

The Bioengineering Scholar High School Internship Project (BE-SHIP) provides high school students with the opportunity to independently propose, execute, and present a bioengineering research project in collaboration with a university research laboratory. Structured around the Bioengineering Research Project (BERP) sequence—comprising a proposal phase followed by a research and reporting phase—the program supports a range of academic goals: Fall and Winter sessions are particularly aligned with preparation for science and engineering fairs, while Spring and Summer sessions are intended to support advanced students in refining their research for conference abstracts, manuscripts, or other scholarly outputs.

## [FAQs](#)

[What are 90000 level pre-college units?](#Q1)[Are award of completion certificates available?](#certificates)  
[How do I request an official/unofficial transcript?](#Q2)[How do I access my grade report?](#gradereport)

**What are 90000 level pre-college units?**  
Courses numbered 90000-99999 are non-credit-bearing, pre-college-level courses designed to provide an opportunity for students to explore academic interests or prepare for college admission. Research Scholars pre-college units may be transferable for secondary school credit at the discretion of the receiving institution. Students should discuss the transferability of individual courses with the registrar of their secondary school prior to enrolling.

**Are award of completion certificates available?**Award of completion certificates are not available for the courses. However, students are welcome to request a transcript or downloand and print their grade report by logging in your MyExtension [here](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/ "https://myextension.ucsd.edu/").

**How do I request an official/unofficial transcript?**For instructions on how to order and pay for an **official/unofficial transcript**, please click [here.](https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts "https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts") If you’ve never ordered transcripts through Parchment before, you will need to register for a Parchment account. Details can be found from the link above.  All transcripts will be printed and delivered by one of the methods listed [here.](https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts "https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts") Transcript requests are processed by Student Services. Should you have any questions, please contact them at [unex-reg@ucsd.edu](mailto:unex-reg@ucsd.edu "mailto:unex-reg@ucsd.edu").

Please note that when grades are not yet posted for the current term, you can still request an official transcript by selecting the "Hold for current quarter grades" option on the transcript request form, which instructs Student Services to wait to send the transcript until all current grades are officially posted to your academic record. This process ensures the transcript reflects your most up-to-date academic performance before it is sent to the requested recipient. 

You can also view/download your **grade report** by logging in your MyExtension [here](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/ "https://myextension.ucsd.edu/") without needing to make a payment. 

**How do I access my grade report?**  
Your final **grade reports** will be available in [MyExtension](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/) within three weeks after the last day of class. For current blended, hybrid or online courses, you can access grades for individual assignments through [Canvas](https://extensioncanvas.ucsd.edu/?_ga=2.192066856.349548968.1614007798-2003140809.1607358536) or by contacting your instructor.
