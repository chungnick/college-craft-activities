# **Bioengineering Broad Overview and Techniques (BE-BOAT)**

The Bioengineering Broad Overview and Techniques (BE-BOAT) courses provide students with a comprehensive introduction to core scientific and engineering principles in bioengineering, complemented by hands-on experience using custom lab kits, pre-lab planning, data analysis, and post-lab discussions. These courses not only build foundational skills in experimental design and interpretation but also serve as preparation for advanced research opportunities through the Bioengineering Research (BE-ROW) course.

## BE-BOAT COURSES

Students must successfully complete ONE BE-BOAT course in order to proceed to BE-ROW. Below are the BE-BOAT courses offered.

  \*\*There is no/minimal planned homework as there is time during the daily sessions for completing the group and individual work. 

  In this course, students will engage in hands-on training within their home-based laboratory environment to develop foundational skills in mammalian cell and tissue culture, alongside a comprehensive understanding of the scientific principles and applications underlying these techniques. Specifically, students will learn to: 

  1. Plan, prepare, and administer solutions to support the propagation of mammalian cells and the cultivation of tissues.
  2. Visualize and capture digital microscopy images of cultured cells and tissues.
  3. Interpret biochemical assays to quantify cellular and tissue growth.
  4. Analyze both qualitative and quantitative data using an integrative approach.

  Participants will gain experience with standard laboratory equipment commonly used in academic and industry settings, including micropipettes, serological pipettes, culture plates, and digital light microscopes. Through this training, students will acquire core competencies in mammalian cell and tissue culture, which are essential for investigating the mechanisms and potential treatments for diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, myocardial infarction, diabetes, osteoporosis, and arthritis. Moreover, these skills form a critical foundation for further study in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, as well as Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.

## Other Program Information

## [Students will need:](#)

Computer and a cell phone, each with internet access, camera, microphone, audio output, web browser, and Zoom software.

## [Fees, Eligibility, and Laboratory Kit Requirements for Remote Participants:](#)

UC San Diego Research Scholars Bioengineering program is a self-supported program that does not receive any State or Federal funding. As a result, we are unable to offer financial aid, grants, or scholarships to our program participants currently.

Students enrolled in the home lab (online) format will receive laboratory kits shipped directly to their designated address; these kits are included in the tuition fee and may be provided on a loan basis. To remain in good standing and maintain eligibility for future UC San Diego Research Scholars programs, all loaned materials must be returned promptly upon course completion. Students should also anticipate an estimated out-of-pocket cost of approximately $50 for locally sourced miscellaneous supplies.

International applicants are advised that additional shipping fees may apply. Furthermore, due to customs regulations in certain countries, some students may encounter restrictions that prevent the delivery of required materials. Nevertheless, all interested applicants are encouraged to apply, as individual circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## [Eligibility Criteria – Grade Level and Age Requirements:](#)

Applicants must be current high school students enrolled in grades 9 through 12 and possess a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. For enrollment in online courses, students must be at least 14 years of age by the start date of the course. For participation in in-person courses, students must be at least 15 years of age by the commencement of the program.
