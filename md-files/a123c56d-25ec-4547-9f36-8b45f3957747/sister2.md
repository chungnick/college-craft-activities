# **BioEngineering Research Orientation Workshop (BE-ROW)**

In the BioEngineering Research Orientation Workshop (BE-ROW) course, students collaborate with active researchers and work in teams to design and carry out a bioengineering research or design investigation from their home “lab,” building on foundational knowledge from a BE-BOAT course or by permission. Through structured project experiences in areas such as BioMechanics, BioImaging, and Tissue Engineering, students engage in the full research process—from literature review and study design to data analysis, scientific writing, and presentation. 

## BE-ROW COURSE

Students must successfully complete ONE BE-BOAT course in order to proceed to BE-ROW. There is one BE-ROW course. Please view below for additional information.

What distinguishes research in Bioengineering from traditional research in biology or technology development in other engineering disciplines? This course offers students the opportunity to explore that question through a guided, team-based biomedical engineering research or design project conducted from their home-based “lab.” BEI²R builds upon foundational knowledge gained through a BE-BOAT course or by instructor permission.  
  
Students will collaborate with active researchers and engage in the full research cycle, including literature review, problem definition, bioengineering modeling, study design, experimental data acquisition, results analysis and interpretation, scientific writing, and formal presentation of findings. A range of pre-defined research topics will be available in areas such as BioMechanics, BioImaging, 3D Printing, MechanoBiology, Tissue Engineering, and Regenerative Medicine, with project assignments based on student interests.

## **Other Program Information**

## [Students will need:](#)

Computer and a cell phone, each with internet access, camera, microphone, audio output, web browser, and Zoom software.

## [Fees, Eligibility, and Laboratory Kit Requirements for Remote Participants:](#)

UC San Diego Research Scholars Bioengineering program is a self-supported program that does not receive any State or Federal funding. As a result, we are unable to offer financial aid, grants, or scholarships to our program participants currently.

Students enrolled in the home lab (online) format will receive laboratory kits shipped directly to their designated address; these kits are included in the tuition fee and may be provided on a loan basis. To remain in good standing and maintain eligibility for future UC San Diego Research Scholars programs, all loaned materials must be returned promptly upon course completion. Students should also anticipate an estimated out-of-pocket cost of approximately $50 for locally sourced miscellaneous supplies.

International applicants are advised that additional shipping fees may apply. Furthermore, due to customs regulations in certain countries, some students may encounter restrictions that prevent the delivery of required materials. Nevertheless, all interested applicants are encouraged to apply, as individual circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## [Eligibility Criteria – Grade Level and Age Requirements:](#)

Applicants must be current high school students enrolled in grades 9 through 12 and possess a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. For enrollment in online courses, students must be at least 14 years of age by the start date of the course. For participation in in-person courses, students must be at least 15 years of age by the commencement of the program.
