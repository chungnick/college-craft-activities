# **Bioengineering Scholar High School Internship Project (BE-SHIP)**

The Bioengineering Scholar High School Internship Project (BE-SHIP) provides high school students with the opportunity to independently propose, execute, and present a bioengineering research project in collaboration with a university research laboratory. Structured around the Bioengineering Research Project (BERP) sequence—comprising a proposal phase followed by a research and reporting phase—the program supports a range of academic goals: Fall and Winter sessions are particularly aligned with preparation for science and engineering fairs, while Spring and Summer sessions are intended to support advanced students in refining their research for conference abstracts, manuscripts, or other scholarly outputs. 

## BE-SHIP Course Progression

Students who complete a BE-BOAT and BE-ROW are eligible for BE-SHIP. Students typically progress from BE-BOAT and BE-ROW to BERP-A then BERP-B. Students who demonstrate exceptional performance in BERP-A/B may be approved to continue for an on-site Summer Internship Project as BE-SHSP, with preparation in the preceding Spring Quarter.

Plan a Bioengineering Research Project: In this preparatory course, students collaborate with a bioengineering research laboratory to develop a design- or science-focused internship project suitable for execution in the following academic quarter. Building upon foundational knowledge acquired through a prerequisite BE-BOAT course, students will engage in a structured process that includes literature review, problem or research question definition, study design, and preliminary pilot studies. The resulting research proposal may be tailored to support applications to science and engineering fairs or other scholarly venues.

Conduct a Bioengineering Research Project: In this course, students will implement their proposed research project through active experimentation and data acquisition, with potential support from a collaborating research laboratory. Students will analyze and interpret their findings, develop a scientific abstract and research paper, and prepare a formal presentation of their work. Projects may be structured to align with the requirements of science and engineering fair submissions or other academic presentation formats.

## Other Program Information

## [Fees, Eligibility, and Laboratory Kit Requirements for Remote Participants:](#)

Students enrolled in the home lab (online) format will receive laboratory kits shipped directly to their designated address; these kits are included in the tuition fee and may be provided on a loan basis. To remain in good standing and maintain eligibility for future UC San Diego Research Scholars programs, all loaned materials must be returned promptly upon course completion. Students should also anticipate an estimated out-of-pocket cost of approximately $50 for locally sourced miscellaneous supplies.

International applicants are advised that additional shipping fees may apply. Furthermore, due to customs regulations in certain countries, some students may encounter restrictions that prevent the delivery of required materials. Nevertheless, all interested applicants are encouraged to apply, as individual circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
