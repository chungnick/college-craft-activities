* [Summer Camps & Community Programming](https://www.lvc.edu/about/camps-community-programming/)
* Computer Programming with AI Summer Camp

Our week-long, immersive computer programing with AI summer camp is designed for rising high school juniors and seniors who want to explore the future of technology and discover whether a career in computer programming or data science is right for them. During camp, students will use Python alongside AI powered tools to solve programming and data science challenges as part of a team.  We’ve forged an authentic experience that will take students from idea to implementation in the span of a week.  The camp features opportunities to connect with LVC alumni in computer and data science, gain exposure to relevant software, and work hands-on with projects that reflect real-world applications.

**In the summer of 2026, the camp will take place** **June 21–26**.

When is the registration deadline?

There is no formal registration deadline, but when the program is full registration will be closed. Because the number of spaces is limited (to facilitate closer collaborations between students, faculty, and guest speakers), it is advised that registrations and payments be submitted as soon as possible to secure a slot.

How and when will I be notified that I’ve been accepted into the camp?

Once we receive your camp payment, Health Information Form and Waiver Form, you will be automatically added to our roster of enrolled students! Additional details about the program, including a detailed schedule, will be sent to all enrolled students prior to the start of camp.

* Check-out (date and time): Noon on Friday, June 26

What do I bring to camp?

Students should bring linens and a blanket (for a twin bed), a pillow, towels, toiletries, clothes, etc. Computer access will be provided for all camp activities; however, students are welcome to bring their own laptop or tablet to use in class or in the dorm (a Wi-Fi access code will be distributed). Although all meals will be provided, campers may wish to bring snacks and/or drinks to keep in their dorm room. The cost of all activities, classes, and meals is included with camp tuition, but campers may wish to bring money with them for bookstore purchases or souvenirs.

Who will be supervising campers in the dormitories? Will the campers be safe?

Campers will live in a college residence hall with Camp Counselors. Camp Counselors are current mathematical sciences majors at Lebanon Valley College who have been selected by the Camp Director based upon their expertise in the computer and data science, as well as their maturity and experience mentoring younger students. The dormitory will be locked at all times, Lebanon Valley College campus safety officers are on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week, and the Camp Director may be contacted at any time by camp counselors.

What will happen in case of an emergency?

Parents/guardians will be contacted in case of any injury or illness to their child. In emergency situations, the safe transport of campers to the nearest hospital will be ensured.
