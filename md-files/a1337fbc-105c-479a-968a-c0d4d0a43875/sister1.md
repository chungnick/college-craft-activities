During a typical day, students work in teams to learn some relevant Python and math to investigate a data science problem. The primary emphasis is on problem solving and effective communication. On most days, an LVC alumna visits the class to discuss her job in the software development and/or data science fields. In the evenings, students participate in supervised activities with curfew at 10 p.m.

Daily activities are organized around a specific problem in data science. Below is a sample schedule for a typical camp day.
