## Financial Information

The program fee for the 2026 session is $9,250. The program fee covers all tuition, room/ board, meals, course materials, and program-related trips. Please, note this does not include travel costs to or from the program.

#### Financial Aid

All students are welcome to apply for financial aid. Financial aid is extremely limited and will only be extended to those who demonstrate sufficient need. Click Here to complete the [Financial Aid Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs5EXQ4JTe6aVqFdPM7ul0JltxcSSLgvDOZaymxaugd-71-g/viewform?usp=header).

#### Deposit Payment:

A non-refundable deposit of $1,500 USD (deposit amounts for financial aid recipients will vary, and this amount will be displayed in your online enrollment form) is due at the time of enrollment (date indicated on your admission letter). The remaining balance is due in full on the date reflected on your tuition bill. Installment payments can be made through Penn Pay until the due date. After completing your enrollment form, you will automatically be routed to the deposit page for payment. If you experience any issues with the enrollment or deposit payment page, please email [pennesap@boldsummers.com](mailto:pennesap@boldsummers.com).

#### Program Payment:

Once you are enrolled in ESAP, a bill will be generated (later) by Penn’s [Student Registration & Financial Services](https://srfs.upenn.edu/).  We will send an email with information on how to log into Penn Pay and access your bill.  However, **please note that our office DOES NOT handle billing, and all applicable inquiries must be made directly to SRFS**.  The balance due (minus the amount of your deposit payment) will be due on the date specified on your bill.\*  If you received a financial aid award, this amount will be deducted from your balance before your bill is generated. The university must receive the full amount due on or before the bill’s due date.  If full payment is not received by the due date, **a late penalty of 1.5% of the amount past due will be assessed**, and your enrollment in the program will be jeopardized.

\***Applicants’ bills are typically be available at the beginning of May** **and will be due by June.**

Please note that students should plan to have access to funds for any personal spending (toiletries, snacks, souvenirs, etc).

International students should also plan to accommodate additional fees such as visa application, SEVIS, and shipping fees.

#### Withdrawing from ESAP:

If you need to withdraw from the program after submitting your deposit payment, you will receive a refund in accordance with the schedule below.  Written requests must be sent via email.  Students dismissed from the program for disciplinary reasons, or those that leave voluntarily, will not receive a refund.

**NOTE:** All requests for a refund must be made in writing and properly dated. Refunds are given based on the date in which we receive your formal written request to withdraw from the program and receive a refund. If your bill has been generated, and your child withdraws AFTER any of the posted refund request dates, you are STILL responsible for the program balance (based on the table below). There are NO exceptions.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Refund Request Date** | **Received Amount** |
| On or Before June 3rd | 100%, less $1500 deposit |
| June 4th – June 10th | 50%, less $1500 deposit |
| After June 10th | No refund (vacancy will remain unfilled) |
