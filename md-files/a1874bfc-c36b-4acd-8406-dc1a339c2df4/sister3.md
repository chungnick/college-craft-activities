## Eligibility

Admissions is highly selective, and each required element of the application is taken into careful consideration. Students who succeed in ESAP not only demonstrate a history of academic excellence, but also creative thinking skills, the ability to work well independently as well as on a team, and the motivation to take an active learning role in a collegiate environment.

The program is designed for rising sophomores to rising seniors.  **Applicants must have completed their freshman year in high school (ninth grade) and must be at least 15 years of age by the start of the program.**  Students currently in their senior year of high school are not eligible for ESAP.  A minimum 3.0 GPA, or equivalent, is required for all applicants with a preference for strong performance in math and science subjects, as well as honors and advanced coursework.

#####

### **PLEASE NOTE:**

#### **ESAP is NOT a summer camp.  Enrolled students will be immersed in an academically intense, fast-paced college environment for the duration of the 3 week program.**
