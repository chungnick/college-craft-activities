# Summer Research Immersion (SRI)

## **About SRI**

SRI is a research-intensive, structured and mentored experience. It consists of either
one or two, four-credit courses over 5 or 10 weeks in the summer. Participation in
the program is a full-time (40 hr/wk) commitment. The 10-week SRI program for 2026
will run from May 26th - July 31st. The 5-week SRI program for 2026 will run from
May 26th - June 29th.

* **Research Stream Part 1** (first 5-week course) covers theory, techniques, protocols and data management of
  the research.
* **Research Stream Part 2** (second 5-week course) consists of applying that to the research problem, as student
  teams plan their experiments, conduct their experiments, analyze the results, and
  present their results.

A dedicated Research Educator designs and oversees the research experience for each
Research Stream in collaboration with a team of three to five tenure/tenure-track
faculty members. Laboratories have been designed, constructed and outfitted to provide
the innovative infrastructure to fully integrate undergraduate students in leading-edge
research in their Research Stream.

For the research conducted, students will work in teams of three to five. We have
students work inter-dependently because developing teamwork and collaborative skills
are so important in research today. Each student team will work on a research question
that is related to the overall objective of the Research Stream for that year.

SRI students learn how to talk about their research, collaborate and identify their
next steps in research. Students finish the three-course program with a public poster
session displaying their results.

## Course Credit

These courses will count toward a Binghamton University degree. The courses also fulfill
various general education requirements and count toward the major that corresponds
to the rubric code of the courses.

You will be billed for the associated course credits. In addition to tuition, there
are comprehensive, laboratory and activity fees as shown in the tables below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **10-Week SRI** | NYS Resident | Non-Resident |
| Tuition | $295/credit x 8 credits = $2,360 | $1,123/credit x 8 credits = $8,984 |
| Comprehensive Fee | $57.20/credit x 8 credits = $457.60 | $57.20/credit x 8 credits = $457.60 |
| Laboratory Fee | $300 | $300 |
| Total Cost | $3,117.60 | $9,741.60 |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **5-Week SRI** | NYS Resident | Non-Resident |
| Tuition | $295/credit x 4 credits = $1,180 | $1,123/credit x 4 credits = $4,492 |
| Comprehensive Fee | $57.20/credit x 4 credits = $228.80 | $57.20/credit x 4 credits = $228.80 |
| Laboratory Fee | $150 | $150 |
| Total Cost | $1,558.80 | $4,870.80 |

  Center for Learning and Teaching's [Summer Session](/academics/summer) student info page.

## Application Process

SRI is particularly appropriate for STEM majors who have completed their first year
and/or STEM majors who have not had an intensive research experience. SRI is for students
who have had the equivalent of at least one year of college and introductory college
science, math and/or engineering (= STEM) courses in their intended STEM major. AP
scores of 4 or 5 may apply to that requirement.

Admission into the SRI program is based on the student's academic record indicating
sufficient preparation to be successful, the student's essay indicating background
and career aspirations, and letters of recommendation from professionals familiar
with the student's aptitude for science and/or engineering.

The SRI **application for 2026 will open in December**. SRI has rolling admission and **application review will start March 2nd, 2026**. The number of slots in the SRI program are limited, so we recommend that you apply
early. Applicants will notified within a few weeks of the application deadline of
**April 5th, 2026**.

* For non-Binghamton University students, official college transcript(s) must be submitted,
  so we can review your math and science courses.
  + Submit these to sri@binghamton.edu.Scanned copies of your official transcript(s) are
    preferred.
  + Cross out or cover your Social Security number (SSN) prior to scanning your transcript.
    Your SSN should not appear on your scanned transcript.
  + Remember to scan your files with care, making sure that they are clear and legible.
    The files you upload are what the Admissions Review Committee will see.
  + Individual files should be under 2 MB. Preferred file format is PDF. Other accepted
    file formats include: .doc, .docx, .rtf, .jpg and .tif

it.

## Policies

* Honesty - Note that any deliberate falsification or omission of application data may
  result in rescinding of admission, denial of permission to enroll or dismissal from
  courses. All applicants affirm acceptance of these terms and conditions.
* Admissions Materials - All admissions materials submitted by applicants become the
  property of the University.
* Program switching - Once the summer program is begun by student, the student cannot
  switch to another research stream.
* Grading policy - Research Stream courses must be taken as regular grading (not pass/fail).
  To continue in the SRI program (from Research Stream Part 1 to Research Stream Part
  2), students are expected to engage fully in the SRI projects, complete all assignments
  in the SRI courses satisfactorily, and demonstrate a steadily increasing ability to
  engage in research-specific projects as they move through the two-semester SRI sequence.
  Students who fail to meet these standards will not be allowed to continue. Students
  should monitor their own progress and discuss any concerns with the SRI staff.

### SRI Student Quotes

“At the start of the summer, I expected research to be similar to the weekly laboratory
biology or chemistry experiments I had done in previous introductory courses. By participating
in SRI’s Biomedical Chemistry Stream, I was able to learn what research is actually
like and all that it entails, from training to experimental design and set up, to
data collection and analysis, to amendment after failed experiments. **Research this summer was completely different than the laboratory experiments I had
done because it was more engaging and interesting knowing that what I was doing was
novel and that this research was not merely for a grade or a lab write-up.**”

“I was nervous when I realized I would have to present my research to an audience
at a poster session towards to end of the program. I had never given a research poster
presentation nor had I created a research poster. SRI allowed me to practice this
important technique. With instructor guidance **I was able to successfully create an appropriate research poster showcasing the research
our team had produced over the summer**. Additionally, I gained experience about how to explain my research to a range of
people from different fields of work.”

“**Every Friday, we attended honors meetings with different research programs from around
the University... it was a great opportunity to learn about different techniques of
research from speakers and our fellow students**. Some of the topics discussed by speakers included elevator talks, data ownership,
and networking. The one that specifically caught my attention was the elevator talks.
It taught me how to explain my research to people who do not work in the biochemistry
field. It is important to limit any jargon and state the importance of the work to
everyday life. Most importantly, it should be short and to the point, hence the name
elevator talk!”
