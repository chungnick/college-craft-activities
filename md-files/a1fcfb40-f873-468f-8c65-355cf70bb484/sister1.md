2026 Application for the First-year Research Immersion's Summer Research Programs

The First-year Research Immersion (FRI) program is offering three summer research opportunities for summer 2026. These summer research programs are particularly appropriate for STEM majors who have completed their first year of college and/or STEM majors who have not had an intensive research experience. In general, qualified students should have had the equivalent of at least one year of college and introductory college science, math and/or engineering (= STEM) courses in their intended STEM major. AP scores of 4 or 5 may apply to that requirement. Program admission is based on the student's academic record indicating sufficient preparation to be successful, the student's personal statement indicating background, motivation for participating, and career aspirations, and recommendation from a professional familiar with the student's aptitude for STEM.
