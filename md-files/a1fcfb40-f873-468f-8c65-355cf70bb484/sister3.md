# Research Streams

Summer research students in SRI or FtRI conduct research in what are known as research
streams, or research courses dedicated to a specific field in science and engineering.
Each research stream has a dedicated laboratory designed and equipped for its specific
type of research and led by a Research Educator.

## Potential Summer Research Streams

Each summer two to three of Binghamton University's First-year Research Immersion
(FRI) program research streams are run during the SRI or FtRI programs. The FRI program
currently has 11 [research streams](/first-year-research-immersion/research/).

## Research Streams for Summer 2026

The Summer Research Immersion (SRI) program will be running the 10-Week SRI program
in the Clean Energy research stream and the 5-Week SRI program in the Biomedical Chemistry
research stream. The Fast-track Research Immersion (FtRI) program will be running
the Biogeochemistry stream. See the table below for more information on each of these
specific streams.

The 10-Week SRI Clean Energy will be conducted at Binghamton University and run for
10 weeks from May 26 - July 31.

The 5-Week SRI Biomedical Chemistry will be conducted at Binghamton University and
run for 5 weeks from May 26 - June 29.

The FtRI Biogeochemistry stream will have a hybrid location running for 5 weeks, with
two weeks at Binghamton University (June 15 - June 27) and three weeks at the Chincoteague
Bay Field Station in Wallops Island, VA (June 28 - July 18).

* [Clean Energy](#acc-18-1)

  **Focus on harvesting and storing energy**. Demand for energy, particularly alternative and sustainable energy, will increase
  substantially over the coming years. The research carried out by students encompasses
  new materials and devices for better energy generation and storage, such as photovoltaic
  systems, thin film electronics, thermoelectric systems, lithium-ion batteries and
  super-capacitors.  The stream is led by Research Educator Dr. Yiliang Luan, and the
  team of faculty stream collaborators include Professors Nikolay Dimitrov, Stan Whittingham,
  Bruce White, Manuel Smeu, and Tara Dhakal.

  **This stream is available to both HARPUR and WATSON admitted students.**

* [Biomedical Chemistry](#acc-18-2)

  Focus on molecular targets for treatment and delivery. The biomedical chemistry research
  stream studies the structure and function of select biological macromolecules, in
  particular proteins, which are important for our understanding of patho-physiological
  processes, as well as for biomedical applications. The goal is to identify molecular
  mechanisms of action of these proteins, and to develop new strategies and methodologies
  to study them, and potentially control their activity. The stream is led by interim
  Research Educator Andrew Ziesel, and the faculty stream collaborators from the Department
  of Chemistry include Brian Callahan, Christof Grewer, Susan Bane, and Wei Qiang. Participation
  in FtRI will result in enrollment for CHEM 261, and successful completion will allow
  entry to CHEM 361 during fall 2026.

  **This stream is available to HARPUR admitted students only.**

* [Biogeochemistry](#acc-18-3)

  **Focus on sustainability of earth systems from perspectives of human and ecosystem
  health**. This research stream is particularly interested in microbes and their geochemical
  interactions with metals and other contaminants, resulting in their coupled short-
  and long-term impacts on physical, chemical and biological interactions. Modern and
  ancient oceans, the atmosphere, watersheds and wetlands provide the field sites for
  our studies. The stream is led by Research Educator Jonathan Schmitkons, and the team
  of faculty stream collaborators include Joseph Graney, Thomas Kulp, Tim Lowenstein,
  and Weixing Zhu. Participation in FtRI will result in enrollment for ENVI or GEOL
  234, and successful completion will allow entry to ENVI or GEOL 334 during fall 2026.

  **This stream is available to HARPUR admitted students only.**
