Learn about a few of SEP’s past programs.

## Cellular Construction Workshop (CCW)

The Cellular Construction Workshop was a 10-day summer workshop for high school teachers and students, that ran from the summer of 2017 to the summer of 2025.  This NSF-funded program, was part of the [Center for Cellular Construction](http://www.centerforcellularconstruction.org), and engaged students and teachers in design challenges as they learned together about the field of cellular engineering.

Cellular engineering is a field of biology that uses cells to solve complex problems. It applies what we know about cells, including how they’re built, make decisions, and accomplish tasks, to develop new technology based on this knowledge. We need a new generation of scientists to help us tinker, build, and figure out how things work so that we can use cellular engineering to make the world a better place.

Students and teachers collaborated in teams to conduct experiments to observe how cells work, and use robots and coding to copy how cells make decisions, and try to solve a real-world problem using what they’ve learned about cells and coding.

## SF Health Investigators (SFHI)

With support from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award, SEP led SF Health Investigators (SFHI) from 2015 to 2020. SFHI was designed to build a community of high school student researchers who, over the course of a year, would learn about health issues affecting their communities, conduct surveys within those communities to understand the existing gaps in knowledge and misconceptions, use data from the surveys to inform the development of health message campaigns, and disseminate those messages. Each year’s cohorts of students tackled a different health topic: infectious diseases, Zika, and vaccines (Year 1); antibiotic resistance (Year 2); cancer prevention and screening (Year 3); and flu prevention and vaccination (Year 4).

Check out the health messaging campaigns developed by SFHI Student Researchers:

* **BeWiseImmunize** – this campaign provides information about the importance of immunizations, videos explaining how vaccines work, the history of vaccinations, and their benefits.
* **SuperDrugDefenders** – this campaign focuses on antibiotic resistance.
* **ScreeningCancer** – these health messages share about cancer prevention and screening.

In collaboration with education researchers from UC Berkeley, the SFHI team developed and validated a novel survey instrument to measure students’ researcher identity. Learn more about this survey and SFHI in these two publications:

## International Teacher-Scientist Partnership Conferences

Three hundred people attended the first International Teacher-Scientist Partnership (ITSP) Conference in 2013, led by SEP and the Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), with funding from the National Science Foundation. Participants deepened their understanding of the broad range of teacher-scientist partnership models, learned about and accessed new resources for teacher-scientist partnerships, discussed ideas for overcoming challenges with teacher-scientist partnerships, and made connections with colleagues. The Conference ended with a poster session held during the AAAS Annual Meeting that featured research from eighty efforts. The second ITSP Conference was held in 2015 in San Francisco. Programs from both meetings are below.

## Triad

With support from the National Science Foundation, SEP led the Triad Project from 1994 to 2003. Triad’s two major initiatives were interwoven: 1) professional development in gender equitable science teaching for participating teachers and scientists and 2) implementation of after-school Triad Science Clubs for students in SFUSD elementary and middle schools. Triad built an extensive community of partnership specialists, education researchers, research scientists, K-12 teachers, K-12 students and families engaged in developing innovative approaches to gender equitable science teaching. This collaborative work ultimately led to the development of the Triad Framework for Equitable Science Teaching. This Framework translated the research literature in gender equitable science teaching into concrete goals and teaching strategies for educational settings, divided into student goals, science goals, and teaching goals.This Framework and reflections written by Triad teacher and scientist participants ultimately led to the publication in 2008 of*Girls in Science: A Framework for Action* by NSTA Press.
