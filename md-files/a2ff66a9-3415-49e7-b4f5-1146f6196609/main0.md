## Summer Neuroscience Program (SNP)

The Summer Neuroscience Program (SNP) is a two-week course for NYC public high schoolers led by Rockefeller graduate students. Participants take a look at ongoing neuroscience research in an effort to understand how the brain works and how it relates to our daily life. We aim to introduce students to modern neuroscience, while empowering them to explore in their own unique ways the mysteries that remain.

#### In SNP students will:

* participate in a series of interactive lectures
* read and present a scientific article
* design an original neuroscience experiment
* meet with Rockefeller scientists
* dissect a brain
* visit research facilities

### **Applications for SNP 2026 are now OPEN.**

**Deadline: March 15th, 2026 at 11:59pm.**

Please visit the [Application Materials](https://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/snp/snp-student-application/) page for further details.

Students work with a partner and a mentor to design their own experiment.

Throughout the program, students get to see inside labs and core facilities. Here, a scientist gives students a close-up look at the lab's experimental animals.

Students present their work at the end of each week in a supportive, relaxed setting.

Students work in small groups to read and analyze a research paper with the help of a mentor.

Students dissect a sheep brain and a cow eye to identify anatomical features that we cover in lectures.

We try to make our lectures as engaging as possible! Here, students are looking at a visual illusion in class to learn how the brain can interpret visual stimuli.

SNP 2026 will take place **August 10-21, meeting Monday – Friday, 10:00 am to 5:00 pm** at the Rockefeller University in Manhattan. All expenses are covered (e.g. meals and all necessary equipment and supplies). Please note that accepted applicants will be required to commit to attending the entire program **in person**.

We seek motivated, mature, and curious students, irrespective of grades or experience with science. We are particularly interested in applications from students with otherwise limited opportunities to develop their passion for science. Applicants must be enrolled in a New York City public school, and must be at least 16 years of age by the start of the program — we cannot make exceptions!

Interested students must complete the online student application and have a teacher complete the reference form. Applications missing either form will not be considered. A subset of applicants will be contacted by the SNP directors in April to arrange an interview.

If you have any questions, please contact us at: [snp@rockefeller.edu](mailto:snp@rockefeller.edu)
