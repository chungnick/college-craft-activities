## SNP Application Materials

**Applications for SNP 2026 are now OPEN.**

The application consists of two online google forms: a set of short answer questions submitted by the student and a reference form submitted by a mentor of the student’s choosing. **Please note that applications missing either form by the deadline will not be considered.** We will invite a subset of applicants for a virtual interview in early April, and will select a final SNP class of twenty students.

We are an outreach program designed to provide a basic introduction to the field of Neuroscience and scientific research. We take a holistic approach when reviewing applications, where we consider both the applicants’ interests and passion in exploring science, and also the broader state of scientific access across NYC public schools. **We are particularly interested in students who are eager to engage with science but have not had opportunities to do so through their school curriculum or through extracurriculars.** Do not be deterred if you do not have an extensive background in science, we’re more interested to hear about **why science excites you!**

**[Student Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUAcHTRIoEv9No9oSGZFPnOM30jEVqPou8XWZmBVdDg2Q1vQ/viewform?usp=publish-editor)** to be filled out by the student  
**[Reference Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbQgWEHUKqgrc8d5fqK5Q79fW7dc-_Qu6k9iUGVg-6YSVh7A/viewform?usp=publish-editor)** to be filled out by a mentor

#### Deadline: 11:59 PM on March 15, 2026.

Incomplete applications (missing either form) will not be considered. Please contact us at [snp@rockefeller.edu](mailto:snp@rockefeller.edu) with any questions or concerns about the application.

#### 2026 Program Dates

August 10-21, 2026 | Monday through Friday 10:00 am – 5:00 pm.

#### Eligibility Requirements

Applicants must be enrolled in a New York City **public** high school, and must be **at least 16 years** of age at the start of the program. ***We do not offer ANY exceptions to these criteria***.

#### For Students:

Fill out the application form and ask a mentor to complete the corresponding reference form. Your mentor can be any adult who knows you well, and does not necessarily need to be associated with science (e.g. could be a boss, faith leader, English teacher, etc.). You only need one mentor to act as a reference. Please feel free to contact us at [snp@rockefeller.edu](mailto:snp@rockefeller.edu) with any questions, concerns, or if you do not have someone to write a reference for you.

#### For Mentors:

SNP is run by graduate students who love nothing more than as-yet unanswered questions. We share a thorough introduction to the brain and current research in the field of neuroscience, while emphasizing the research process and the power of scientific inquiry. As such, we don’t necessarily look for “straight A” students, but rather those who flourish when allowed to exercise their creativity, curiosity, and independence. Do you know a student who would be a good fit for our program? Please recommend them by filling out the reference form! (And let the student know so that they can submit an application.)
