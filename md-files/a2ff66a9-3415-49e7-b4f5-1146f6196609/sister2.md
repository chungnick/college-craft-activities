## FAQs

### Who is eligible to participate in SNP?

If you are enrolled in a New York City Public high school and you will be 16 years old on the first day of the program, we encourage you to apply. You don’t need perfect grades and you don’t need to have had previous experience with science outside of school!

### Does the program cost any money?

SNP is free! All expenses are covered, including MTA fare, meals, and supplies throughout the program.

### When does SNP take place?

SNP takes place during the last two full weeks of August, meeting on weekdays from 9:30am to 4:00pm (please see the main page or nominations page for specific dates).

### Where does SNP take place?

SNP happens fully **in person**on the Rockefeller University campus in the Upper East Side of Manhattan (66th Street and York Avenue). We pay for your transportation to and from campus every day. (By the way – SNP 2020, was held virtually! The summary lives **[here](https://snprockefeller.wixsite.com/mysite)** and it’s a useful reference for what our program covers!)

### When are the application forms posted?

Application forms for the upcoming summer are posted by the end of January. Applications are due in March.

### Once I’ve applied, when can I expect to hear from SNP directors regarding interviews and placement in the program?

Applicants can expect to hear via email whether they have been selected for an interview by the first week of April. Interviews will be conducted virtually. Interviewed students should expect to hear a final decision about acceptance into the program by the end of April.

### What does a typical day at SNP look like?

A typical day will consist of morning class sessions, lunch, and afternoon hands-on activities. For more detail, check out the sample schedule.

### Is there homework? Are there tests?

No homework, no tests, no grades! However, expect to be challenged. While in class, students will read research articles, conduct experiments, and prepare presentations. All work will be done during course hours, and punctuality and attendance is required.

### What kinds of students participate in SNP?

All kinds of students participate in SNP! You don’t have to have a ton of prior neuroscience experience – just a real desire to learn more. Similarly, we don’t look for one “type” of student. You can be shy or outgoing, and as long as you’re inquisitive, thoughtful, and independent-minded, you’ll fit right in. We’re particularly interested in applications from students who haven’t had much previous opportunity to explore scientific interests (e.g. underrepresented minority, limited access to science extracurriculars, humanities-focused high school).

### Are there any minimum GPA or curriculum requirements?

There are no requirements for GPA or curriculum (we don’t ask for your grades). The only requirements are that students must be responsible, respectful, motivated, and curious.
