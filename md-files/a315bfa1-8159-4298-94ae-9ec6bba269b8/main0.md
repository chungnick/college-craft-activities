# Teachers and High School Students Program (TAHSS)

**Are you a high school sophomore or junior interested in a career in STEM or healthcare? Do you want to know what these careers are like and how to obtain them? If you answered YES to either question, the STEM+M CONNECT program may be a good fit for you!**  
  
Please see the information below to learn more about the program and who is eligible.

To apply for the program, **you must first attend an Information Session** that will be held via Zoom on January 21 at 8pm or January 30 at 6pm. If you are unable to attend either of the information sessions, please contact Valerie Solon at [SciEd@tufts.edu](mailto:SciEd@tufts.edu).

[Register for an info session here](https://tufts.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YXVEb5ISR7eZ8VhGrH9YZA#/registration)

The Teachers and High School Students (TAHSS) Program was founded in the fall of 1989 with the goals of exposing interested high school students of varied backgrounds to health care and related professions, and providing support in their academic and personal development.

In 2023, the [Office for Multicultural Affairs (OMA)](/about/school-medicine/administrative-offices/multicultural-affairs "Office for Multicultural Affairs") and the [Center for Science Education (CSE)](https://sites.tufts.edu/ctse/) at Tufts University School of Medicine began a collaboration that bridges the strengths of the Teachers and High School Students (TAHSS) Program and the CSE’s Mini Med Connect program. The new program's name is STEM+M CONNECT.

Tufts STEM+M CONNECT offers high school students a unique one-month paid summer experience that combines a residential experience of Tufts Pre-College programs [Mini Med School](//universitycollege.tufts.edu/pre-college/browse/mini-med-school) or [Lab Science Investigations](https://universitycollege.tufts.edu/pre-college/browse/lab-science-investigations) with a multi-tiered mentoring program. The programming is designed for highly motivated students from the Boston area, particularly students who will be first in their family to attend college, or students who come from low socioeconomic status backgrounds.

Our goal is to CONNECT you with other high school students, undergraduate mentors, and Tufts faculty to build friendships and networks to support your exploration of career pathways!

The program is funded by Tufts University School of Medicine and other generous donations.

More information can be found on the [STEM+M CONNECT Program](https://sites.tufts.edu/ctse/pre-college/mini-med-connect/) website.

  *If you have any questions about your eligibility, please contact us at* [*SciEd@tufts.edu*](mailto: SciEd@tufts.edu)*.*

  ### Program Information:

  The CONNECT programming begins the week before the residential Pre-College programs and continues the week after, with follow-up experiences throughout the next year.

  #### CONNECT has FIVE key strands:

  + **Let’s Have Fun** – Bonding activities to build relationship between high school students and mentors (games, movies, field trips and more)
  + **The Hidden Curriculum** – Workshops about professional and life skills that are rarely explicitly taught
  + **Celebrating Diversity in STEM +M** – Networking with and spotlights of diverse professional role models
  + **Let’s Learn Some Science** – Activities such as reviewing biology concepts prior to the Pre-College programs and tours of lab spaces
  + **Individual Mentoring** – Structured weekly check-ins with undergraduate STEM Mentors

  #### Mini Med School

  Mini Med School is a summer intensive that provides driven students who are interested in medical school and other health professions the opportunity to study with one of the nation's leading medical schools: Tufts University School of Medicine.

  The program is run and designed by faculty from the Department of Medical Education and is instructed by Tufts medical students and faculty. Students will experience what it takes to study medical sciences through lectures on cutting-edge topics and medical case studies coupled with hands-on training, which includes time in the Clinical Simulation Center and advanced anatomy lab at the Tufts medical campus. Question and answer sessions with admissions staff, doctors, medical students, and professionals from other medical fields (such as dentists, veterinarians, and physician assistants) will help participants get a feel for medical school and career options they have in medicine and related health sciences.

  For more details, please look at the Mini Med School webpage [here](https://universitycollege.tufts.edu/pre-college/browse/mini-med-school).

  #### Lab Science Investigations Highlights

  In the Tufts Lab Science Investigations: Antimicrobial Resistance, you will become a researcher working to understand the challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and antibiotic stewardship. Just imagine a world where antibiotics don’t work! AMR claimed 1.27 million human lives in 2019. If trends continue, drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050, surpassing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer as a leading cause of human death.

  As a student researcher in Lab Science Investigations: Antimicrobial Resistance, you will have a uniquely immersive experience with the One Health approach that recognizes that the health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment. In the case of AMR, excessive use of antibiotics in agriculture, animals, and people, all contribute to this problem. To address this, you will hear perspectives from experts in many fields who work together at the Tufts Levy Center for Integrated Management of Antimicrobial Resistance (CIMAR), work with laboratory and research techniques used by engineers, social scientists, biomedical scientists, veterinarians, physicians, drug developers, epidemiologists, healthcare policy experts, and environmental scientists.

  For more details, please look at the Lab Science Investigations webpage [here](https://universitycollege.tufts.edu/pre-college/browse/lab-science-investigations).
* ### History of TAHSS

  The TAHSS Program has undergone a number of changes since its inception. In 1989, Tufts University School of Medicine created the Minority High School Tutorial PLUS Program to provide local minority/disadvantaged students with access to medical student tutors. Additionally, in 1989, Tufts University School of Medicine received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to start the Minority High School Research Apprenticeship Program. This program was launched to offer research experiences to local minority/disadvantaged students during the summer. The Teachers and High School Students Program is an extension of both programs. In 1999, TAHSS became a combined initiative of Tufts University School of Medicine and an NIH-supported program, the National Center for Resources Minority Initiative: K-12 Teachers and High School Students.

  Finally in 2023, the Office for Multicultural Affairs ([OMA](/about/school-medicine/administrative-offices/multicultural-affairs "Office for Multicultural Affairs")) and the [CSE](https://sites.tufts.edu/ctse/) began a collaboration that bridges the strengths of CONNECT and the Teachers and High School Students ([TAHSS](/local-global-engagement/pathway-programs/teachers-and-high-school-students-program-tahss "Teachers and High School Students Program (TAHSS)")) Program.

  **Our current collaboration between CSE and OMA expands access partnering communities in the Greater Boston area, maximizes residential and clinical experiences, and amplifies our capacity to provide academic and personal development to all STEM+M CONNECT students and alumni.**
