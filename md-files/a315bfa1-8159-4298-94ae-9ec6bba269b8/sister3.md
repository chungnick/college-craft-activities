***Summer 2026 Applications open December 1st, 2025!***

Are you interested in a laboratory- based experience where you contribute to a research project that studies a critical societal challenge?

In the Tufts Lab Science Investigations: Antimicrobial Resistance*,* you will become a researcher working to understand the challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and antibiotic stewardship. Just imagine a world with no antibiotics! AMR claimed 1.27 million human lives in 2019. If trends continue, drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050, surpassing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer as a leading cause of human death.

As a student researcher inLab Science Investigations: Antimicrobial Resistance*,* you will have a uniquely immersive experience with the One Health approach that recognizes that the health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment. In the case of AMR, excessive use of antibiotics in agriculture, animals, and people, all contribute to this problem.. To address this, as part of the STEM Research Institute*,* you will hear perspectives from experts in many fields and you will work with laboratory research techniques used by engineers, social scientists, biomedical scientists, veterinarians, physicians, drug developers, epidemiologists, healthcare policy experts, and environmental scientists, who work together at the Tufts Levy Center for Integrated Management of Antimicrobial Resistance (CIMAR).

## Highlights

Meet experts in fields across STEM including physicians, biomedical scientists, engineers, dentists, veterinarians and environmental scientists

Gain experience in interpreting, using, and analyzing evaluating real experimental data in real world contexts

Make lifelong friends with students from all over the world

[Learn More](/pre-college/student-life)

## Guidelines & Access

Safety & Campus Access

#### University Facilities

Students will have full access to the university’s facilities including the libraries, computer lab and student center. Students will also have full access to Tufts’ Steve Tisch Sports and Fitness center, featuring racquet courts, a swimming pool and cardio and weight-training equipment.

In addition, SMFA Studio Art Intensive students will have access to supervised studios and resources including, the W.Van Alan Clark Library, the media stockroom (where you can borrow any equipment necessary for your art), the School Store, the computer lab. [See more details about our studios.](https://smfa.tufts.edu/about/spaces-resources)

#### Health & Wellness

Tufts works hard to ensure the health and well-being of all of its students. Once accepted to the program, Tufts will ask all students to submit information related to their health and will collect details regarding allergies and accessibility concerns. Tufts and Residential Life staff will work together to ensure students’ routine medical needs are met.

Tufts also has procedures in-place for students with urgent or emergency needs, illnesses, or injuries. Our procedures combine on-campus and hospital-based care depending on the nature and severity of the issue. A student’s emergency contact will be notified, if one is provided, in the event of an issue. Please see our [Health & Wellness Services](/about/university-resources/health-wellness) page for additional information.

Please note that the Pre-College Program does not offer onsite mental health counseling for participants. Participants are encouraged to stay in touch with their local provider as needed.

In any type of health & wellness emergency, students should immediately contact Tufts University Police at (617) 627-6911.

**Please note:**medical fees of any kind will be billed to the student and are not included in program fees.

#### Campus Security

Tufts University is considered very safe among U.S. college campuses. Although crime on campus is unusual, we do have an open campus in a major metropolitan area and we expect our students to exercise good judgment and responsibility as they navigate the campus. Tufts University maintains its own police department, on the job 24 hours a day, if an emergency arises. Each location is equipped with an emergency blue light phone system and residence halls require a current and valid Tufts ID card for entry and a mechanical key for access to bedrooms. Emergency processes and protocol will be reviewed during orientation.

For more information, please visit our [Campus Safety](https://publicsafety.tufts.edu) page

Supervision

Tufts takes the safety of its students seriously. All programs are staffed with resources appropriate to care for the size and nature of the program. Tufts makes reasonable efforts to secure background checks and provide Title IX training to every staff person responsible for students in its Pre-College Programs.

Students are required to attend all elements of the program schedule, and any expected absences must be communicated to program staff in advance. Tufts takes the safety of its students very seriously. As such, our current policy for Pre-College students states that students cannot be in a lab or leave campus during their program without the supervision of a staff member or explicit parental permission received through official processes.

Some elements of our supervision plan vary depending on how the student is interacting with our campus. Below is a brief overview of where to find information about this. Please note that not all programs offer residential/commuter/virtual options, but the below applies when they do:

* **Residential Students:** Safety in the dorms is also paramount. Please see the Residential Students section below for more information about how our Residential Life program is staffed.
* **Commuter Students:** The commute to campus and time outside of the program will not be monitored by program staff, although the Tufts University Police Department and other safety protocols (in which students will be trained) are available to Tufts community members at all times. Detailed information about traveling to each of our campuses, including details on parking, [can be found here](/about/university-resources/parking-transportation). Please check the course list if you do not know the campus on which your course meets. Please note: Commuter students are not permitted to enter any residence halls on campus.
* **Virtual Students:** Students are required to attend all elements of the program schedule, and any expected absences must be communicated to program staff in advance. Tufts takes the safety of its students very seriously, even in the virtual environment. Students who enroll will receive more information about our virtual safety protocols.

Residential Students

**Check-in**

Check-in will begin at 9 am on the first Sunday of the program (or Monday, 7/1, for Tufts College Experience & Tufts Summer Research Experience). Students are welcome to arrive on campus and check in on Sunday between 9 am and 5 pm, and between the hours of 12 pm and 3 pm if arriving by car. During check-in, room assignments will be distributed and students will have the opportunity to meet their Residential Coordinator (RC) and roommates and unpack.

For students arriving from out of town on their program's arrival day between 9 am and 5 pm, there is a shuttle service from the airport and train/bus station for students arriving from out of state. All details about arrival and departure travel will be communicated after you have been admitted to the program.

Students arriving outside of the specified window should be in touch with us to discuss what accommodations can be arranged. While we make reasonable efforts to accommodate students who need to arrive early or depart late, we cannot guarantee the same services will be available to students arriving or departing outside of the specified windows.

**Residential Life**

Residential students will get the full Tufts University experience by living on-campus in one of Tufts' undergraduate dorms! Rooms are air-conditioned with 24/7 security and hospitality; accessible rooms may be available upon request.

Bedrooms will be doubles in a common hall. Halls are divided by gender and age, and students are grouped into smaller communities known as Resident Advisor groups. Roommates and RA groups are determined based on the pre-program housing questionnaire, taking into account age and geographic diversity. Full bedding and towels will be provided and replaced weekly. Wi-Fi is available throughout campus.

Resident Coordinators (RCs) will live in each hall and work to create a strong, supportive residential community. A Resident Coordinator's role is to support students in every aspect of their summer experience while serving as a mentor and active leader.

The residence hall is secured at all times, and students are required to use a current, valid Tufts ID card for entry into the building. Each individual dormitory room is secured with either a mechanical or digital lock.

A dedicated residential staff oversees student safety during the entirety of the program. Students are honor-bound to follow clear safety protocols, whether on campus or in the city, and are required to use the buddy system during free time. Tufts takes the safety of its students seriously. All programs are staffed with resources appropriate to care for the size and nature of the program. Tufts makes reasonable efforts to secure background checks and provide Title IX training to every staff person responsible for students in its Pre-College Programs.

See our policy section for additional information, and please do not hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.

**Residential Staff**

Residential staff will support students as they adjust to living in a dormitory and being responsible members of a summer program community. The residence staff will include a director, senior staff, and one resident advisor for every ten students. Prior to the program, residence staff will be trained to lead student groups, manage student conflict and resolution, and oversee all safety aspects of the program. They will begin the program well-prepared to meet the needs of all Tufts Pre-College Program students.

**Dining**

Residential program fees include three meals per day and brunch/dinner on Sundays. All meals on the Medford/Somerville campus will be at Dewick-MacPhie Dining Center, conveniently located a few minutes from student housing. Dewick-MacPhie provides a wide variety of menu choices, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and an organic salad bar. All meals on the Boston Fine Arts (SMFA), Boston Health Sciences, or Grafton campuses will be provided through boxed lunches or by Tufts staff. Tufts staff will also provide meals for program-related activities taking place off-campus. Tufts Dining is able to accommodate most dietary restrictions and preferences. Please advise us of dietary needs during the application process.

**Activities & Trips**

We want your summer to be fun too! It is summer after all! Residential Life staff will be planning trips and activities throughout the summer that will allow students to make friends, build relationships, and relax from the world-class academic work they will be doing in the classroom.

**Daily Activities**

Daily activities might include ice cream socials, midnight pancakes, trips to local coffee houses for poetry readings, lectures around campus, visits to Davis Square, etc. The cost of most of these activities will be included, however, incidentals like coffee at the coffee house or public transportation fares for an optional activity will not be covered by the program.

Many programs are also planning their own program-specific activities, often thematically relevant to the program content itself. Look out for these activities in the program description above and in the information provided after you enroll!

**Trips**

Examples of past weekend trips include excursions to Six Flags New England, Crane Beach in Ipswich, Downtown Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Duck Boat tours, Charles River Cruises, and more! Please note that weekend trips vary from year to year and these are only examples of the kinds of trips this program might include. The cost of any such excursions (including transportation, entrance fees, regularly scheduled meals, and supervision) is included in the cost of the program, although souvenirs, extra food, and other incidentals are not.

Commuter Students

### **Commuting to the Program**

We know that for some students, living on campus is not the best option. We welcome you to our program! For commuter students, the program will begin at 9:00am on the first Monday of the program with an orientation and end at 2:00pm on the last Friday of the program with a closing event. Saturdays and Sundays are not program days and commuter students are not expected on campus on these days.

**Medford/ Somerville:** For more information on commuting to the Medford Campus click [here](/pre-college/student-life/enrolled-students).

**SMFA:** During each day of the program, commuter students should arrive on the Fenway (SMFA) campus at 9:30am, and proceed directly to their program's location. Students must depart from campus at 4:30pm. Students remaining on campus past 4:45pm, arriving before 9:15am, or on non-program days will not be under the care of program staff (parents accept responsibility). Detailed information about traveling to the Fenway (SMFA) campus, including details on parking and public transportation, [can be found here](https://smfa.tufts.edu/directions). Alternatively, commuter students may opt to take the bus with residential SMFA Studio Art participants travelling between Tufts Medford/Somerville campus and the SMFA Fenway campus. Commuter students opting for this option must arrive at the Somerville/Medford campus by 8:45am and be picked up at the Somerville/Medford campus at 5:15pm. No alternative transportation will be provided for students who arrive to campus after the bus departs. Specific meeting location and updated times (as needed) to be provided closer to program start.

Commuter students and their parents are responsible for ensuring their student travels to and from campus safely and on time each day. Detailed information about traveling to the Medford / Somerville campus, including details on parking, [can be found here](/about/university-resources/parking-transportation).

**Please note:** commuter students are not permitted to enter any residence halls on campus. Breakfast / dinner are not provided for commuter students.
