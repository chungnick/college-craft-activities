UNT AI Summer Research Program

# UNT AI Summer Research Program

### **The UNT AI/CS Summer Research Program** brings together students from a variety of AI-related academic programs to supplement their traditional course-based educational experiences with focused, project-oriented research efforts.

---

A unique aspect of this program is the immersive 10-week effort which guides students
through all stages from initial project selection to research poster presentation.
This is accomplished through intensive group efforts, including brief daily full group
meetings ("huddles") and daily project group meetings lead by faculty and grad students.
The intensive period culminates in a celebration and poster presentation event on
the final Friday. This initial period demonstrates what can be accomplished with well-organized,
focused, and intensive group effort, and accelerates the student preparation for more
independent efforts throughout the summer and into the next academic year. We accept
students with both AI and general interests in computing.

### WHO CAN APPLY?

A variety of UNT student and faculty populations are integrated in the program, with
some participation more formally arranged than others. The includes faculty, PhD students,
MS students, and undergrads including TAMS. The "How to Apply" section details general
expectations for all students. Each of the participating groups has additional expectations,
requirements, or enrollment limits described below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **MS students (AI, Data Engineering, AI-oriented CS or CE)** | Students in this group are required to sign up for CSCE 5934: Directed Study credit under one of the program coordinators if accepted - check your degree program if such credit assists toward graduation. Only those selected for the program will be able to sign up for course credit. |
| **MS students in other Colleges (e.g. Information, Business, Science, etc) or Engineering departments** | Given current resources, 10-15 students in these colleges or other departments will be selected. Proficiency in programming and diversity of skills will be used in selection. |
| **TAMS students** | NOTE: The TAMS Summer Research Scholarship deadline was early this year (2025) and decisions have already been made on support. Early Summer Research TAMS students (those just beginning the 2 year TAMS program) are particularly encouraged to apply to jump-start engagement in research. 5-10 TAMS students will be selected.  TAMS students who are also selected for the TAMS Summer Research Scholarship will be required to be at Discovery Park at least 30 hrs/week following the 10 week summer class schedule, as the program requires 10 weeks of participation. |
| **Undergraduates (non-TAMS)** | Undergraduate special topics course options are possible with one of the coordinators. Up to 10 UNT undergraduates (not in TAMS) will be accepted. |
| **Ph.D. students** | Do not apply to the program in the same manner as other students; however, Ph.D. students conducting AI-related research that can benefit from engaged, focused, and well-managed AI students are strongly encouraged to present their project idea to one of the program coordinators well before the first day of the summer program as an option for program students to sign up. If a Ph.D. student's project is selected, they will be expected to help advise the group pursuing that project with almost daily contact during the relevant program session. |
| **Faculty** | Faculty with project ideas are also encouraged to contact one of the coordinators who maintain a curated list of project titles, abstracts, and resources that the students in the AI summer program select among on the first day. Note: The day-to-day project planning, meeting, and advising are provided by the program coordinators and participating graduate students. It is suggested, though not required, that faculty providing project ideas or support are available for contact by project groups at least once/week over the summer for feedback. In our experience, the ideal project options provided by faculty are well-defined problems with data readily available that students can pursue relatively independently, with only daily assistance by a coordinator or knowledgable grad student. Additionally, students have to choose it on the first day so it must be appealing among the options available, and all project options presented are expected to lead to external impact. |

### [APPLICATION](http://forms.gle/fDF2LoTFFfsiBu837)

Review the following requirements and make sure you meet them before proceeding to
the application:

**Availability**

* You are available without extensive interruption for both the morning and afternoon
  sessions every workday in the 10 weeks of the program.
* **In-person attendance is required.** You should not be taking concurrent summer classes during your session given demands
  of the program.

**Experience expectations**

* You must be actively completing a degree program at UNT or through a previous arrangement
  with the coordinators.
* You have substantial programming experience, ideally Python.
* For CSE MS students only, you have taken an introductory AI/Machine Learning/Data
  Science course (e.g. you can explain what "cross validation" is, and why it's useful
  - or you understand train/validation/test splits).
* Your GPA at UNT must be 3.0 or higher, and you must have completed at least one semester
  of courses at UNT prior to the summer.
* If you are a TAMS student: these are not requirements - though similar experience
  is encouraged.

**Materials to prepare before submission**

* Prepare a Resume or CV for upload for the online application.

### FAQ'S

1. **I have a question about the program, who do I ask?**  
   Any questions, comments, or concerns please email one of the coordinators: Mark Albert
   at mark.albert@unt.edu or Ting Xiao at ting.xiao@unt.edu.
2. **Do I need to take a research course with this?**  
   We expect students to be signed up for an appropriate research course (e.g., CSCE
   5934: Directed Study if an MS student in CSE). This is required for CSE students,
   but for students outside CSE there may be flexibility. Coordinators will reach out
   to help you sign up for the appropriate course and explain expectations for grading,
   but it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to determine if the course counts
   toward their graduation requirements. Students will not be treated differently in the program based on whether or not
   they are enrolled in course credit. Attendance expectations are clearly more important
   with course credit on the line, and a lack of participation is generally the only
   way this course grading would be affected.
3. **But what if I am not as interesting in AI - I just want to participate in this environment?**  
   That is perfectly fine. We also have CS-focussed projects about developing software,
   as well as more AI focussed project efforts. In fact, traditionally there have always
   been projects with a development focus in addition to AI model building/validation/testing.
   This is why we may refer to the program as the UNT AI/CS Summer Research Program.
