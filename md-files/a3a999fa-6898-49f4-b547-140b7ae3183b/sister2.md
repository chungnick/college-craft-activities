The College of Information at the University of North Texas (UNT) will conduct a 10-week
summer research program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for 10 undergraduates
from **May 19 to July 25, 2025** titled "**Beyond Language: Training to Create and Share Vector Embeddings across Applications**". The goal of this REU is to teach students how to build modern Artificial Intelligence
(AI) systems capable of communicating their acquired knowledge across domains. Knowledge
is about much more than what can be described in language, and we aim to train students
to handle this new way of communication. We welcome rising sophomores, juniors and
seniors from accredited undergraduate institutions who are U.S. citizens or permanent
residents to apply for this NSF REU program to conduct research with faculty members
at UNT. Underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply, as well as those
from academic institutions with limited research opportunities.

**Deadline:** Please submit the application form by **March 21st, 2025.**

Students participating in this interdisciplinary undergraduate research experience
will be trained in techniques that will allow them to more efficiently communicate
the knowledge acquired by self-supervised deep learning models. The 10 participating
students will create vector representations of common terms or items that appear across
various applications, utilize those embeddings to improve prediction models, and properly
validate and document the benefit of this approach. For the first 5 weeks, students
will be exposed to different embedding strategies and machine learning applications
utilizing them, then transition to demonstrations and trouble-shooting of their individual
research efforts in the last 5 weeks. Early in the program they will identify an embedding,
application domain, and external advisor to work with among a number of presented
options. Students will also participate in a long-standing, unique [AI/CS summer research program](https://ai.unt.edu/unt-ai-summer-research-program) integrating current UNT students and external REU students to facilitate collaboration
across departments and collaboration among a range of students and faculty mentors.

We are grateful to the NSF and the College of Information, the Department of Information
Science, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and many offices at UNT
for providing support to this program.
