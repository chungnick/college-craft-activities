## Teachers and students are talking

Stop automatic slide show

“I've coached students in several STEM competitions over the years, but why we can't   
quit Samsung Solve for Tomorrow is that it embodies all the best practices that we want   
for our students: relevance, student choice, and collaboration."  
– National Finalist teacher

“Samsung Solve for Tomorrow showed us all that even as high school students, you could   
have a positive impact, that if there’s a problem in the community, you have the power to fix it.”  
– National Winner student

“I know of no other program that offers the students so much beyond the actual   
competition part. The way you really take the kids into your family and offer them so much   
more than just a "win" is amazing and why I love Samsung Solve for Tomorrow.”  
– National Finalist teacher

“It inspired the confidence that each of us was indeed capable, believing that ‘I can and I   
WILL’ succeed. Samsung Solve for Tomorrow opened so many doors for me. It really   
changed how I thought about things after the competition had ended.”   
– National Winner student
