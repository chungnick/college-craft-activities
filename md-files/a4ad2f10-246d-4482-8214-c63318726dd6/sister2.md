# Use Your Summer to Excel

## Young Nebraska Scientists High School Researchers

Gain paid summer experiences in the labs of Nebraska scientist-educators. Mainly for high-school juniors and seniors, these jobs are typically part-time (<40 hours per week). YNS accepts "HSR" applications in early spring for a limited number of available positions. After the hosts make selections, YNS notifies the successful applicants (usually in April); work generally begins in early June and ends in early August. The student researcher and the faculty member decide the schedule, location, etc.

Being a YNS HSR is an excellent way to learn valuable new skills--such as coding--and extend your capabilities (sharing your work via research poster or other science communication is one expectation at the end of the summer). Plus, you'll gain a mentor and join the team of a real scientific project – wonderful for your college applications and/or resume.

## Emergent Quantum Materials and Technologies (EQUATE)

(funding through NSF EPSCoR Track-1 grant via Nebraska EPSCoR)

High School Researchers from summer 2023

### Quantum Materials, Nanoscience, Chemistry (University of Nebraska - Lincoln)

EQUATE will  advance knowledge on topics related to quantum materials, technologies, and computation. These new technologies will revolutionize fields such as information technology, medicine, metrology, and cryptography, with an impact on security areas such as defense and banking. High school researchers will use their scientific skills to create a wide range of new materials that can revolutionize quantum computing. Students will learn to grow and characterize new materials according to their structure, transport, and magnetic properties.  Other high school researchers will build and use new technologies such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) microscopy to find better ways to characterize materials or determine new applications such as non-invasive detection of neuron activity in animals. This is an exciting field with numerous projects and applications. Use this opportunity to find your place in the quantum revolution!

### 

> "I liked being able to be part of an actual research lab and that the people in the lab didn't treat me like a high school student, or like I was inferior or didn't understand. They treated me like I was part of the lab and deserved to be there."
>
> **2019 High School Researcher**

### 

> "Doing something with your own hands is the magical part, especially as a high schooler in a college lab. This expereince showed me how STEM can be applied, not necessarily in the classroom environment, but by solving real world practical problems and making an impact."

> **2019 High School Researcher**
