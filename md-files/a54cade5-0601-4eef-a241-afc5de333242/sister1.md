### Meet Past Scholars

### Naomi Jespersen

#### PROMISE Scholar in 2025

### Kaia Van Der Merwe

#### PROMISE Scholar in 2025

**Watertown High School, Sioux Falls, SD**

"I learned how to dive deeper into a subject on my own. When I’m looking at something that doesn’t make sense, I can go read a paper that explains it properly."

### Calla Freesemann

#### PROMISE Scholar 2024

**Washington High School**

"I liked the hands-on experience that the program provided; there are very few opportunities available for high schoolers interested in research that allow the same level of invested time and learning about science and research. I feel I gained more confidence in my research ability and more clarity in what I would like to do in the future. I also learned how to communicate and collaborate with those around me."

### Arthur Tao

#### PROMISE Scholar in 2023

**Lincoln High School, Sioux Falls, SD**  
**Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts**

"Learned and became familiar with lab techniques such as cell culture, luciferase assay, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting: Through rigorous training and practical experience, I acquired a solid foundation in various advanced lab techniques, equipping me with practical skills that are useful for future research endeavors."

### Ariana Edwards

#### PROMISE Scholar in 2022

**Washington High School, Sioux Falls, SD  
University of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD**

"I was able to meet so many influential people and had the opportunity to convey my knowledge about my project to them which was amazing.
I learned a lot about how to communicate my science to other people in a way that allowed them to be excited about it too. You learn so much in such a short period of time it’s amazing!"

### Grace DiGiovanni
