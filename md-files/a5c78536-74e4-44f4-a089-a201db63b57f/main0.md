# IFSS Program (for High School students)

## Applications for **2026 IFSS Program** will open in **Early 2026**

Thank you so much for your interest in IFSS. We are so thrilled by the number of students expressing interest in IFSS and chemistry research. We applaud your enthusiasm, and even if we are not able to host you this summer, we hope that you will continue to explore opportunities to learn more about chemistry and research as you move forward in your education.

For students seeking other opportunities on the Stanford campus, our [Office of Community Engagement](https://community.stanford.edu/learning-all/k-12-programs) maintains a list of options. We also recommend checking out the [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/education/students/highschool.html), which hosts conferences and programs for students at all levels.

As we are a small department and a volunteer-run program, we only have capacity for a small number of students to participate in the IFSS program. To ensure we have the bandwidth to support our local students and to thoughtfully review applications, we have found it necessary to establish a clear set of eligibility criteria and firm deadlines. We appreciate your understanding.

---

## **Proposed 2026 Program Dates**:

## **Monday, June 15th - Friday, June 26th, 9 AM-12 PM, M-F**

### Inspiring Future Scientists through Shadowing (IFSS)

Hosted each summer, the focus of the Inspiring Future Scientists Through Shadowing (IFSS) program is to provide rising high school juniors and seniors who are at least 16 years of age by the start of the program (no exceptions can be made to the age cut-off) with the opportunity to learn more about cutting-edge chemical research. Throughout the two-week program, participants will observe and converse with a number of different graduate students in the chemistry department. There are many different types of research; therefore, shadowing a couple of different researchers will allow you the chance to learn broadly about a wide array of scientific topics and techniques.

Unlike programs that emphasize individual research projects, IFSS stands out by allowing participants to shadow multiple researchers. This approach enables a broader understanding of the field and fosters a well-rounded scientific perspective.

While conducting your own research project is undoubtedly valuable (and we appreciate the enthusiasm!), IFSS focuses on the rich experience of shadowing professionals and gaining exposure to diverse research endeavors. If your goal is to embark on a specific research project, we encourage you to explore other summer programs tailored to that objective.

Join us for two weeks of inspiration, discovery, and interaction with the scientific community. Apply to IFSS to learn more about the world of possibilities in chemical research!

### Eligibility

*Due to the high volume of students who are already applying, kindly understand we are not able to make exceptions for any of the requirements listed below.*

**Age requirement:**Students **must have turned 16 by the first day of the program in order to be eligible**. If you turn 16 after the first day of the program, even if this occurs during the course of the program, you are unfortunately not eligible. We encourage you to apply next year! Students who will have already graduated from high school by the start of the summer program are also not eligible to apply.

**Geographic requirement:**IFSS aims to welcome local high school students to campus and to build relationships with schools in our community. IFSS is a free program, but we cannot provide funding for room, board, and transportation (including on-campus parking fees). **You must** **live AND attend school (or homeschool) locally to Stanford University in one of the four counties: Alameda, Santa Clara, San Francisco, or San Mateo, to be eligible to apply.**Please note that if you attend school and reside elsewhere during the academic year - even if you have local contacts with whom you could stay during the summer program - we are unfortunately unable to accept your application at this time.

**Participation requirement:** All students who attend are expected to be available and present for the full 2-week program, as there are important safety training and other activities that cannot be missed. Students with overlapping commitments should not apply.

One of the primary goals of the IFSS program is to provide hands-on scientific research experience to students who do not otherwise have access to this opportunity. IFSS aims to provide a new and unique experience to its participants. Applications are open to students of all backgrounds.

### COVID-19 Requirements

To comply with Stanford University policy requirements, participants experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to stay home and test negative for COVID-19 before returning to campus. If symptoms appear on-site, rapid COVID-19 tests will be available through the University. Any positive COVID-19 test will require the student to isolate for the remainder of the program.

### Application Information

By the application deadline at 11:59 PM on March 1, 2026, students must complete and submit the application form, linked HERE.

Please note that due to the high volume of applications we receive, no late submissions can be accepted.

By the application deadline at 11:59 PM on March 1, 2026, recommenders must send a recommendation from their school/work email to chemistry-ifss [at] stanford.edu (chemistry-ifss[at]stanford[dot]edu). The recommendation has the following instructions:

1. The recommendation must be sent as a PDF document with the format StudentApplicantName\_RecommenderName\_IFSS2026 from the recommender’s email, directly to %20chemistry-ifss [at] stanford.edu (chemistry-ifss[at]stanford[dot]edu).
2. The recommendation must be no longer than one page, single-spaced, size 12 font.
3. The recommendation should address ALL of the following questions/topics, and can include anything else the recommender would like:
   1. Verify the name of the student for whom you are submitting a recommendation
   2. Briefly describe how long and in what context you have worked with this student
   3. In what ways does this student demonstrate a strong interest in chemistry (or closely-related areas)?
   4. In your opinion, does this student possess the requisite interest and personal maturity to participate in IFSS?
   5. How does IFSS represent a unique opportunity for your student to gain exposure to scientific research at the university level?

Student applicants: please note that, due to high application volume, we will not have the bandwidth to respond to emails requesting confirmation that we have received your recommendation. Please remember to contact your recommender well in advance to ensure they have sufficient notice to submit before the deadline. Please check in regularly with your recommender for confirmation that your recommendation has been submitted.

As we seek to understand why a student is personally interested in this experience, the use of AI is strictly prohibited in preparing an IFSS application. Accordingly, all IFSS applicants must comply with the [Stanford Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code) established by the Stanford Office of Community Standards.
