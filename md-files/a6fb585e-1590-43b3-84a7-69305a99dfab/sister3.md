Do I need to complete the scholarship question?

Scholarships are based on merit and financial need.

Can I participate in if I attended the program last year?

Past participants are welcome to reapply, but preference will be given to students who can get the most out of the program.

Think about what will help you grow and explore, and consider applying to other programs here in Orange County and around the country.

If you are reapplying, clearly explain in your application essays what you hope to gain from participating again.

What can I do to help myself or my child get accepted into the program?

**Applicants**: Proofread your essay for context and grammar. We understand that grammar mistakes happen, but spending a little extra time to make sure your answers really tell us who you are and what you care about can make all the difference.

**Families**: Ask your student to share what topics they wrote about or to read you her essay. Give feedback on where more detail can be added.

Is there an overnight program?

No, the Summer Healthcare Experience Program is not an overnight program.
