\*\*A $25 fee is added to a student’s account for each Student Health Services visit.

For more information about meal plan options, please visit the [Housing & Dining](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/high-school-honors/housing-dining/) page.

The application fee and spending money are not included in the total charge. You may also purchase a six-week membership to BU’s Fitness and Recreation Center for an additional fee when you arrive on campus.

**Note:** Application fees and tuition deposits are nonrefundable. No refund or reduction in the total charge will be made if you arrive to the program late, leave the program early, or are dismissed from the program due to a violation of the program guidelines.

## Financial aid

Limited financial aid is available for the [High School Honors](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/high-school-honors/) program. Please note that awards are based on both financial need and academic merit.

**Financial aid requests and supporting documents must be uploaded with your program application.  To reveal the financial aid request form in the application, you must answer “Yes” to the “Would you like to apply for financial aid?” question. Once you enter “Yes”, the financial aid request form will appear in the left navigation panel.  We do not accept financial aid requests via email.**

If you would like to be considered for financial aid, please submit the following documents:

* Pages 1 and 2 of your parents’ or guardians’ 2024 or 2025 Federal Income Tax Form (filed in 2025 or 2026). **Social security numbers must be blocked out before uploading.**
* A letter from your parent or guardian describing your general financial situation and the particular circumstances that prevent you from paying the full tuition and fees.

Financial aid applications must be received by February 4, 2026. Please note: students applying for financial aid will receive an admissions decision within three weeks of the deadline on February 4, 2026. You will not receive an admissions decision before the deadline regardless of when you apply.

**Note:** Applications with financial aid requests are not considered complete until all materials, including financial aid documents, have been submitted. Admission decisions are made without regard to financial aid consideration. Commuter and online students enrolled in only one course and international students are not eligible for financial aid.

## Scholarship opportunities

The Summer Term Scholarship is a need-based award that provides a scholarship for one student to attend the High School Honors program. Preference is given to students who demonstrate strong financial need.

## Payment deadline

The payment deadline is May 1, 2026, or the date indicated in your offer of admission. Full payment not received by the deadline may result in the cancellation of your enrollment.

## How to pay

Boston University accepts payment for High School Honors by credit card, check, or international wire transfer. You will need your BU ID number to submit payment.

Specific information for making payment, along with your BU ID number, is provided through our online enrollment portal. After completing your Participation Agreement and paying your $1,000 nonrefundable deposit, you will receive an email with information about accessing the portal.

**Note:** International students are also required to submit an Immunization Requirements Form before you can be enrolled in the program and receive a BU ID number.
