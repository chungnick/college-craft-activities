## Check-in, Orientation, & Departure Information

When making travel arrangements, please keep in mind the following check-in and departure information:

### Check-in

Information about check-in locations will be made available at a later date. Program assistants will be available to provide support during the check-in process.

### Orientation

**Residential students:** You should plan to arrive on campus no later than 4 pm on Sunday, June 28. If you are not able to check in by 4 pm because of flight restrictions, you must contact the Summer Term Pre-College Programs office at least one week before the program begins so that arrangements can be made.

* The program begins promptly at 5:30 pm on June 28 with dinner with your program assistant. Meet on your floor’s common room.
* You must attend the program orientation at 8 am on Monday, June 29.

**Commuter Students:** Commuter students are required to check in and attend an orientation at 8 am on Monday, June 29. This is a good opportunity for you to meet program assistants and learn the program policies. If you are only enrolled in online courses, you’re not required to travel to campus for orientation.

### Room assignments

If you’re moving into the residence, you will receive your room assignment and room keys at check-in.

Please see [What to Bring](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/admitted-students/what-to-bring/) for information on what you need for your stay.

### Departure

Final examinations are typically given on the last day of class, so students should arrange to leave after their final class of the session. Residential students may stay an extra night in the dorms if travel arrangements require it, but all students must be fully vacated by 10 am on Saturday, August 8 (no exceptions). If you stay until the morning after the program concludes, you must continue to follow all program rules and guidelines.

## A Day in the Life of a Residential High School Honors Student

What’s your day like as a High School Honors student at BU? That depends on your [courses](https://www.bu.edu/summer/courses/high-school/). When choosing your classes, take note of what days and times they meet. That’s your course schedule for the six weeks of the program.

Meals are provided by one of the dining halls, with a range of cuisines available that include vegetarian and vegan options. The dining staff can also accommodate food allergies and other dietary restrictions.

While at BU, you will share dorm life and social activities with students from the [Research in Science & Engineering](../../rise-internship-practicum/) (RISE) and [Academic Immersion](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/) (AIM) programs. To help you get to know everyone, and become familiar with the BU campus, and Boston, we plan a variety of fun group events during the first week. After that, we offer a variety of optional activities on weekdays and weekends. There are also a few mandatory activities scheduled throughout the program. Your weeknights are free for homework, impromptu activities, and time with friends until curfew. Take a look at our Program Activities below to see the types of exciting events we plan.

You will also have plenty of free time to enjoy the BU campus and [all that Boston has to offer](../../admitted-students/about-boston/). In addition, you can purchase a short-term membership to BU’s [Fitness & Recreation Center](https://www.bu.edu/fitrec/), study at one of BU’s [libraries](https://www.bu.edu/library/about/), relax on the “BU Beach” (a popular student hangout with views of the Charles River), or visit Boston’s diverse neighborhoods.

## A Day in the Life of a Commuting High School Honors Student

What can you expect as a High School Honors commuter student at BU? That depends on your [course(s)](../../../courses/high-school/). Commuter students can take either one or two courses, for a minimum of 4 credits. When choosing your courses, take note of which days and times they meet. That’s your class schedule for the six weeks of the program.

Commuter students are not on a meal plan, but you may choose to dine with friends in one of the dining halls, with a range of cuisines available that include vegetarian and vegan options or at [campus dining locations](https://www.bu.edu/dining/where-to-eat/) (hours vary by individual restaurant). The dining staff can also accommodate food allergies or other dietary restrictions.

While studying at BU as a commuter, you will attend social activities with your High School Honors peers and [Research in Science & Engineering](../../rise-internship-practicum/) (RISE) and [Academic Immersion](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/) (AIM) program students. Commuter students will have access to BU’s residence hall during designated hours.

To help you get to know everyone, and become familiar with the BU campus, and Boston, we plan a variety of fun group events during the first week. After that, we offer a variety of optional activities on weekdays and weekends. There are also a few mandatory activities scheduled throughout the program. You will be expected to take part in a select number of social events. Weeknights are free for homework, impromptu activities, and time with friends. Students will have access to the residence hall during designated hours. Take a look at our Program Activities below to see the types of exciting activities we plan.

## Program Activities: Let the Fun Begin

There are so many great activities you can participate in as part of High School Honors: group outings to Faneuil Hall and Newbury Street, movie and game nights in the dorm, career workshops, basketball at FitRec, ultimate frisbee on the Boston Common, and more.

They’re all designed to help you get to know the city of Boston and your fellow students, and to build a strong sense of community. Also, they’re fun!

Take a look at the program activities offered from past summers for an idea of how you can spend your time here.

High School Honors students join with [Research in Science & Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/rise-internship-practicum/) (RISE) and [Academic Immersion](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/) (AIM) students for most activities.
