This prestigious fellowship is open to any graduate student working at the intersection of digital technologies and democratic processes.

The Digital Democracy Fellow is expected to participate in IPaT programming throughout the academic year and will be featured in IPaT communications. The Fellow is also expected to collaborate closely with the Democracy Program at The Carter Center, seeking out opportunities for joint work and research collaboration. The Fellow is expected to work physically from The Carter Center executive offices approximately one day a week and to attend relevant meetings of the Democracy Program. In sum, the Fellow is expected to become an active and enthusiastic intellectual partner to the Democracy Program while pursuing their graduate research agenda.

Interested graduate students should submit a cover letter outlining their experience at the intersection of digital technologies and democratic processes and summarizing a research direction they might pursue under the Fellowship. The application should also include a copy of their CV. Applicants also must submit a reference letter from their advisor.

**Applications are due by August 4 and should be sent by email to Cynthia Moore, cynthia.moore@ipat.gatech.edu**

The Fellow will be selected by IPaT leadership and announced in August. Recipients of the Fellowship will receive $15,000 dispersed to their advisor. These funds may be used to pay for a portion of the Fellow’s GRA or in other ways supportive of the Fellow and consistent with the policies and procedures related to the administration of such funds.

Applicants have the opportunity to work in Savannah but it is not required.  
  
**Makerspace:**  
Seeking an intern interested in developing a computer vision system to automatically capture object outlines ("shadows") and use a CNC device to cut designs out of foam ("shadow foam"). This work will involve researching appropriate CNC devices for the application and creating a workflow or pipeline between the capture system and the CNC device.

**Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):**  
Are you passionate about supporting the elderly and have a love for cooking? We're seeking student interns for the summer to help with a project focused on human-centered research with people diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (pwMCI) and their care partners. This role offers the unique chance to work closely with pwMCI, engaging in data collection, labeling, and potentially evaluating innovative prototypes in a real kitchen setting.  
Our project aims to observe and collect various data from cooking sessions where pwMCI and their care partners collaboratively prepare a simple three-course meal. The insights gained from these sessions are crucial for understanding their interactions, spotting opportunities for intervention, and overall coming up with solutions to enhance their cooking experiences.

**As an MCI intern, your responsibilities will include:**  
•    Refining the cooking research protocol to meet different needs, such as recipe variations or changes in the data capture setup.  
•    Assisting in the setup and execution of cooking sessions, including preparation of materials and operation of data-capturing devices.  
•    Encoding and cleaning data by noting significant actions and interactions.  
•    Evaluating kitchen prototypes to assess their impact and usability.
