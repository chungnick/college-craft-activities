## Convergence Innovation Competition Asia  2025

The Convergence Innovation Competition Asia (CIC Asia) aims to build entrepreneurial confidence, people-centered mindsets, and permission for innovation. Founded in 2007, CIC is one of the Georgia Institute of Technology's oldest and most storied competitions and is organized by the Institute for People and Technology (IPaT).  
  
CIC Asia focuses on global teams tackling global challenges. Student teams across Asia at higher education institutions with a [faculty fellow](https://research.gatech.edu/ipat/cic/fellows) are invited to submit innovative and viable product and service ideas. **This year we are focusing on teams from China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.** Entries can be based on class projects, student research projects, as well as personal hobbies and interests. Each team should identify one, or more, of the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) that their project is aiming to tackle. Projects can also align with one or more of [IPaT’s current research concentrations](https://research.gatech.edu/ipat/research).  
  
Finalists will receive travel support to attend the gala competition in December in Malaysia. The winning team will go on to receive travel support to visit innovation events and engage with entrepreneurship programs at Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, USA. In addition, the finalist teams will receive US $1,000 while the winning team will receive US $2,000 to help launch their idea.
