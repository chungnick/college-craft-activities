# Scholarships and Financial Aid

An NC State education is an investment in your future. Explore the links below to learn about the financial aid opportunities and responsibilities that will help you make the most of that investment.

## Types of Financial Aid

Financial Aid is the resources provided to a student to meet his or her college expenses.

Financial aid funds may come from federal, state, institutional and private sources. There are two basic types of financial aid: gift funds (money that does not need to be repaid) and self-help funds (money that is borrowed and must be repaid, or earned while enrolled).
