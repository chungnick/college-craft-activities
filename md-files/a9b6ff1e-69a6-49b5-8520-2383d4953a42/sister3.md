### What are the admissions criteria?

We’re looking for motivated high school students who are taking a college preparatory curriculum. Your high school transcript, a positive recommendation, involvement in extracurricular activities, and a well-written personal statement (plus a writing sample for AIM: Creative Writing applicants) can also influence admission decisions. See the [How to Apply](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/how-to-apply/) page for details.

### How many students attend AIM?

Approximately 50 students will participate in each course. Students live and participate in social activities with [Research in Science & Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/rise-internship-practicum/) (RISE) and [High School Honors](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/high-school-honors/) (HSH) students. These programs are also comprised of about 130 students.

### Is there a specific format for the recommendations?

Yes, once you create login credentials and can access the application form, you will submit your recommendation request on the Recommendations page. **We strongly recommend you submit the recommendation request as soon as you have identified your recommender(s)** – do not wait until you are ready to submit the entire application to request the recommendation. Teachers appreciate having as much time as possible to respond. **Please note that the emailed recommendation form must be used and outside letters cannot be accepted. The recommendation consists of a series of multiple-choice questions and one open field response.**

### Is there financial aid available?

There is no financial aid for the AIM program.

### When is my application considered complete?

Your application is considered complete only after all required materials are received and verified by our office. We will contact you if any additional or corrected materials are needed to complete your application. You can check the status of your application at any time through your [Applicant Portal](https://summer.bu.edu/account/login). See the [How to Apply](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/how-to-apply/) page for details about application requirements.

### Can I check to see if my application is complete?

Applicants will be able to check the status of their submitted applications at any time through their [Applicant Portal](https://summer.bu.edu/account/login).

### How long after I submit my application should I expect a response?

Within one month of your application being verified as complete by our office, you will be notified of an admission decision.

### Once I am accepted into AIM, am I required to go to the program?

You can either accept or decline our offer of admission, but we ask that you inform us of your decision within one week of receiving your offer of admission. Please note that attending students are required to pay a $1,000 nonrefundable deposit to secure a spot in the program.

### Do I need to bring a laptop or tablet to campus?

AIM students are highly encouraged to bring a laptop or tablet to campus to access online course materials. Only basic functions are needed; any classes that require specific software will be held in a computer lab. If you have any questions or concerns about computer requirements, please [contact us](https://www.bu.edu/summer/contact-us/ "https://www.bu.edu/summer/contact-us/").

### Is there a curfew?

Yes, there is a curfew for residential students. You must be in the dorm by 11 pm during the week (Sunday through Thursday) and midnight on weekends (Friday and Saturday). You are then free to visit with friends in the common areas until 1 am during the week and 2 am on weekends.

### Am I free to leave campus?

You are allowed to leave campus during your free time as long as you are accompanied by at least one other student in the program and let your program assistant know you are leaving. Residential students must be back in the dorm before curfew or the start of any mandatory activity. You may not leave the boundaries set by the program within the city of Boston without the permission of your parents and our program. These boundaries will be reviewed with students once they arrive on campus. Our program reserves the right to restrict your access to any part of Boston for security or other concerns.

### Can I visit with my parent or guardian, relatives, or family friends in the Boston area during the program?

If a parent or guardian is in town and would like to spend time with you, that visit must be scheduled during your free time when there are no activities planned. They are welcome to visit with you anywhere within our campus boundaries.

If you would like to visit your parent or guardian, relatives, or family friends (at least 18 years of age) within city limits, that visit must be scheduled during your free time when there are no mandatory activities planned. In addition, your parent or guardian must submit a Leave Request Form. This request must be received **at least 72 hours** before you are planning to leave campus and, for weekend leave requests, before 3 pm EDT on Friday. Requests are not reviewed on nights and weekends. Your parent or guardian will need to provide details about the visit, such as the time that you will be picked up and dropped off at campus, and the cell phone number of the relative or family friend (at least 18 years of age) you will be with. You are only authorized to leave once the Summer Term Pre-College Programs office gives permission and sends your parent or guardian approval via email.

Residential students must return to the dorm by curfew.

### What is the schedule of activities for AIM?

The full schedule of activities will be emailed to participants two weeks in advance of the program. You can find out more information about the types of activities we offer [here](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/academic-immersion/calendar-of-events/#social-events).

### Is there a fee for visiting Student Health Services?

Yes, there is a $25 fee each time you visit Student Health Services and there may be additional charges for medical supplies or immunizations. These charges will be billed to your student account. Blood work is billed directly to your insurance, so please bring your insurance information.

### Can I request to room with a friend?

No. We believe that learning to live with someone new is an important part of the pre-college experience. Program activities and free time provide plenty of opportunities to hang out with friends, who will also be living in a residence hall on campus.

### I have a documented disability. How can I submit a request for accommodations?

Boston University is committed to ensuring that students with disabilities have equal access to all opportunities the University has to offer. Disability & Access Services (DAS) works to provide services and support to ensure that students are able to access and participate in the opportunities at BU. Classroom, testing, housing, and dining accommodations may be requested through DAS. For more information, please visit the [Admitted Students](https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/admitted-students/student-services/academic/ "https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/admitted-students/student-services/academic/") section of our website.

### Whom can I contact at Boston University if I have more questions?

We are happy to help you. You can find all of our information on the [Contact Us](https://www.bu.edu/summer/contact-us/) page.
