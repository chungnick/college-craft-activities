# Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP)

**The deadline to submit SYEP applications is extended to March 14, 2025.**

The Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) is the nation’s largest youth employment program, connecting NYC youth between the ages of 14 and 24 with career exploration opportunities and paid work experience each summer.

Through SYEP, participants can explore different interests and career pathways, develop productive workplace habits, and engage in learning experiences that strengthen their social, civic, and leadership skills.

By participating in structured project and work-based opportunities, NYC youth are better prepared for careers of the future.
