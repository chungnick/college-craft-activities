The Stanford Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging (AIMI) is committed to advancing AI research in medicine for public good, promoting health equity and excellence in healthcare. In this spirit, we are excited to launch our annual Summer Research Internship for high school students interested in exploring technical and clinical aspects of AI in healthcare.

## Program Overview

During this two-week virtual program, we aim to spark interest and empower the next generation of AI pioneers in medicine. On a day-to-day, the internship generally consists of:

* Introductory and technical lectures on AI in healthcare fundamentals
* Mentoring activities with Stanford Student Leads and researchers
* Hands-on group working sessions for research projects
* Social activities
* "Meet the Expert" sessions with guest speakers representing academia, industry, non-profit, government. etc.
* Students who attend the entirety of the internship will receive a Certificate of Completion once the program is complete.

Concurrently, we hold the Summer Health AI Bootcamp program for high school students. Learn more about the Bootcamp [here](/education/aimi-summer-bootcamp "AIMI Summer Health AI Bootcamp").

We will be adhering to Stanford's policies for [Protection of Minors](https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/protection-minors).

## Key Dates

  + Session A: June 15-26, 2026 (9am-1pm PT)
  + Session B: July 6-17, 2026 (9am-1pm PT)

**\*IMPORTANT NOTE:** Stanford University will be on winter closure from December 22, 2025, to January 2, 2026, and no applications (including Financial Aid) will be reviewed during this period.

## Eligibility

* All interns must be residing in the United States for the full duration of the program. Applicants must currently attending a US high school (entering 9th grade through 12th grade in Fall 2026). At this time, we are unable to accept international students or applicants residing outside of the US.
* Must be over the age of 14 by the start of the program
* Strong preference for students with strong math and/or computer programming skills and/or experience with a healthcare project
* Due to limited space, we expect students to commit to participating for the full-day agenda (9am-1pm) throughout the entirety of the 2-week program

Stanford AIMI embraces inclusion, integrity, diversity, and team-science as pillars for success. We encourage students from all backgrounds to apply, particularly students from groups under-represented in AI, including, but not limited to, first generation students, students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, students with disabilities, students who are members of federally recognized tribes, students who have been underrepresented in the field on the basis of gender identity or expression of sexual orientation, or students with work, educational, or life experiences that contribute to the diversity of the field of AI in medicine.  Applications are open to individuals of all backgrounds and will be reviewed and selections made in conformance with applicable law.

## Fees

* **Application Fee:** $45
* **Program Participation Fee (if accepted):** $2,400

## Application

The online application consists of questions related to your background, short-essay questions and uploading your unofficial transcript. You will receive a copy of your completed application upon successful submission.

Applications for 2026 will release on December 15th, 2025.

## Financial Aid

The AIMI Summer Research Internship and Summer Health AI Bootcamp program offers financial aid opportunities to support eligible students. The deadline to apply for financial aid is  **February 13, 2026 at 11:59pm PT** (1 week before the deadline to apply for both programs, which is February 20, 2026).

* Eligibility will be assessed on a rolling basis. If we determine you do not meet the financial aid eligibility criteria, you will be notified no later than February 17, 2026 so you have time to submit the standard application before its deadline.
* Please note we are not able to transfer responses between applications; save a copy of your answers. A copy of your submitted responses will be emailed to you.
* If you are found to meet the financial aid eligibility criteria, your application will be reviewed along with all other applicants and you will be notified of the final decision by May 1, 2026.
* If you are accepted into the program, you can receive partial or full financial aid.

**Eligibility Criteria for Financial Aid:**  
To qualify, you must meet **one** of the following criteria, along with **providing the corresponding proof**:

1. **Gross Family Income Below $80,000 per Year**
   * Proof required: A copy of the family’s 2024 tax return showing total annual income.
2. **Enrollment in a Federal, State, or Local Program Supporting Low-Income Families**
   * Proof required: Official documentation on letterhead from the program confirming the student's enrollment.
3. **Demonstration of Financial Need**
   * Proof required: A letter from a high school principal, high school counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader explaining the student’s financial need. The letter must be on official letterhead and include the name, role, email, and phone number of the person providing the recommendation. Alternatively, the applicant may write a short essay explaining their financial need or extenuating circumstances. Please note, we may schedule a follow-up discussion and request additional documentation to verify the details provided.

All applications are subject to verification. Please note that applying for financial aid will not impact your admission decision into the program(s).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**What is the reason for introducing fees for the program, when it was previously offered at no cost?**

As we continue to expand our Summer Programs for high school students, we are committed to delivering a high-quality, impactful learning experience for our participants. In previous years, we did not charge for participation, but due to the growing number of applicants and our commitment to continually enhancing the curriculum, we have introduced a program fee. This fee allows us to ensure that every student receives the resources, mentorship, and support they need to thrive in the program, while also enabling us to accommodate a larger number of students and maintain a high standard of instruction. The fees help support our dedicated staff and faculty, facilitate access to cutting-edge educational materials, and offer the best possible experience for all participants.

We understand that fees may present a challenge for some families, which is why we have established a financial aid process to ensure that qualified students can still participate, regardless of their financial situation.

**How many students will be accepted into the program?**

We accept around 50 students into the program. This may be subject to change in 2026.

**Do you accept applications after the deadline?**

We receive a high volume of applications during the application period and are not accepting any additional applications past the deadline.

**Am I eligible to apply if I’m not currently living in the U.S. or if I’m not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident?**

Due to the overwhelming number of applications we receive, the program is geared towards students residing in the US and attending a US high school in Fall 2026. Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or individuals on a valid visa to be eligible. Proof of identity and citizenship, permanent residency, or visa status is required. Applicants must also have a U.S. address for program participation, as the program requires for participants to be based in the U.S. during the program. If your visa status or living arrangements change before or during the program, you are required to notify the program staff within one business day.

**Can students include letters of recommendation in their application?**

Letters of recommendation are not a requirement to complete the application and therefore may not be considered during the selection process.

**I do not have a background in computer science or coding but am interested in the internship. Can I still apply?**

We have a strong preference towards students with a strong computer science, math, and/or biology background. Students with little to no coding experience are encouraged to explore the Summer AI Bootcamp.

**What is the difference between the Summer Research Internship and Summer AI Bootcamp?**

The Summer Research Internship geared towards students with strong technical skills and is more project-focused, as students are tasked with solving a practical problem in the AI in medicine space with little guidance. The Summer AI Bootcamp is geared towards learners of all levels who are interested in learning about the fundamentals of machine learning in healthcare, and will be more lecture- and discussion-focused.

**Can I apply for both the Summer Research Internship and Summer AI Bootcamp?**

Yes, you may apply for both. However, if accepted, you may only participate in one program.

**What are the expectations for student participation in this virtual program?**

The  AIMI Summer Research Internship and Summer Health AI Bootcamp are fully virtual experiences, and we expect all participants to be comfortable learning in a digital environment and collaborating with team members online. Daily participation with cameras on is required, and students should be ready to engage actively with instructors, peers, and course materials. This is a dynamic, team-based experience, and your involvement is key to getting the most out of the program.

**What can interns expect in terms of continuous engagement with Stanford researchers and faculty after the internship program concludes (for ex. publishing research findings in academic journals, poster presentations, etc.)?**

We cannot guarantee continuous engagement after the internship at this time. The internship project is small in scale and would likely not be sufficient to constitute a publication.

**Will participating in the internship guarantee a Letter of Recommendation for my college applications?**

Letters of Recommendation for college applications/future programs from Stanford AIMI Faculty/Staff are not guaranteed, and may depend on a variety of factors such as intern participation, performance, engagement, and quality of work. Participating in the Summer Research Internship will not guarantee admission into a Stanford undergraduate program.

**Are AIMI Summer Programs credit-bearing?**

Participation in AIMI Summer Programs is not credit-bearing, meaning that completion of either programs will not directly contribute towards fulfilling academic requirements or earning course credits toward graduation. Instead, it serves as an enrichment opportunity aimed at fostering additional skills and experiences outside the traditional academic curriculum.

**Do participants of the summer programs receive a Certificate of Completion?**

Yes, participants of both summer programs will receive a Certificate of Completion, given that they attend and participate for the full duration of the program.

**Is there any advantage to applying earlier, or do applications get reviewed only after the deadline?**

Applications are reviewed after the deadline, so there is no advantage to applying earlier. All applications will be considered fairly, regardless of submission time.

**I made an error in my application, but I already submitted it. Can I go back to re-submit?**

Unfortunately due to the high volume of applications, we are unable to accommodate any changes to applications once they've been submitted. Only one submission is allowed per applicant.
