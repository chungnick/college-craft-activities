# Summer LEAD Program

The University of Connecticut’s Summer LEAD Program is a unique enrichment program for high-achieving rising Connecticut high school seniors to gain exposure to college life. The Summer LEAD experience includes admissions and financial aid information, transition to college skills, and building a peer network of students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Students who are first-generation to college, enrolled in [Alliance School Districts](https://admissions.uconn.edu/uconn-alliance-pathway/), or from populations underserved in higher education are encouraged to apply.

The Summer LEAD Program gives participants the opportunity to learn how to make the college experience work for them. We will discuss the various resources that can support success and consider how leadership can positively contribute to the college experience.

Participants will:

* Live in a residential hall on the UConn Storrs main campus for the duration of the program
* Attend sample classes and personal development sessions
* Connect with faculty, staff, and current UConn students
* Learn about the college admission and financial aid processes

## Save the Date

The Summer LEAD Program is reserved for Connecticut high school students entering their senior year and will take place from **July 12-14, 2026**.

Application details will be available in the upcoming weeks.

## About the Program

The Summer Lead Program is a two-day, non-credit, pre-college residential experience hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions on the Storrs main campus. Participants will have the opportunity to learn more about life as a college student while attending college planning, leadership, and skill-building sessions.
