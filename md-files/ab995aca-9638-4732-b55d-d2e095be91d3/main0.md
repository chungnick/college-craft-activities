As a high school student, work in world-class scientific laboratories with cutting-edge technologies

Page Content

## Overview

Are you a high school student in Duval or St. Johns counties in Florida interested in biomedical sciences? The SPARK Research Mentorship Program provides rising junior and senior high school students with unparalleled mentored research experience in world-class laboratories at the Mayo Clinic campus in Jacksonville, Florida.

SPARK scholars gain experience in basic science, the research process, critical thinking and professional conduct — and they do it all in Mayo Clinic's state-of-the-art facilities working with some of the top researchers in their fields.

### Program highlights

SPARK provides an opportunity to gain exposure to the real world of scientific inquiry and nurtures interest and enthusiasm for science. During the program, SPARK scholars produce highly competitive projects that they enter in science fairs, and many have won regional and state awards, honors, and prize dollars for their research. Many SPARK scholars go on to prestigious colleges and universities to pursue studies in fields related to science and medicine.

Participation requirements include spending a minimum of 25 hours per week working in mentor laboratories during the summer break from school, plus additional arranged time during the school year.

The SPARK program has grown in participation and success every year since its beginning in 2017. Dozens of talented Florida high school students have participated in SPARK and have gone on to pursue further education and careers in science.

The success of our program is demonstrated by the accomplishments of our scholars. Alumni have gone on to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), in the Clinical Research Internship Study Program (CRISP), and have majored in chemistry or a science-related major.

### Research interests

SPARK provides opportunities for high school juniors and seniors interested in expanding their research experience in a variety of specialized research areas:

* Biochemistry and molecular biology
* Drug development
* Epidemiology
* Immunology
* Cancer biology
* Artificial Intelligence
* Neuroscience
* Regenerative sciences

During the application process, you will indicate your research preference.
