# Cost of Attendance

Create a summer experience that invigorates your mind without emptying your wallet. Explore the many ways in which you can reduce educational expenses with [financial aid](https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/financial-aid-summer) and other [Summer Savings](https://summer.ucsb.edu/cost-savings/summer-savings)!

During the summer, fees are determined by a student’s status at the time of enrollment. Students pay per unit that they are registered for, and incur additional fees depending on their student category and specific circumstances. For example, course materials such as textbooks, and the cost of room and board, are not taken into account in the fee breakdown below. Please note that fees listed are subject to change, and campus-based fees are particularly subject to change as they are decided by student vote. [Financial aid packages](https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/financial-aid-summer "Summer Financial Aid ") take all fees into account and are available during Summer Quarter.

These services include, but are not limited to, counseling, advising, tutoring, student information systems, and programs. Students who are not physically on campus can still access these services remotely, and financial aid packages take these fees into account regardless of the mode of instruction. Click to view a full [breakdown of student fees.](/sites/default/files/documents/CBF%20Summer%202025.pdf "CBF Summer 2025")
