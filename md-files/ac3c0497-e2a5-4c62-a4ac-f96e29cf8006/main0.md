More than an education, New York University’s High School Summer Art Intensive is an experience!

Designed to provide close attention to a select number of young creatives through rigorous and unique studio projects, visits to New York City’s art institutions, as well as visits to other off-campus sites where artists live and create, NYU’s High School Summer Art Intensive builds a community that extends beyond summer.

### Goals for Our Students

* Create a new body of work that students can use in potential college portfolio applications.
* Experience new materials and technologies like textiles and laser cutting to enhance their breadth as artists and makers.
* Learn about the NYU art department, its facilities, faculty, and unique approach to contemporary art in an intimate first-hand way.
* Understand what it means to be a working artist in New York City, from working artists themselves ranging from artists at the emerging stages of their career to those who have established themselves internationally at the vanguard of contemporary art.
* Experience New York City! Students will have scheduled free time during the week and in the evenings to explore what makes New York City the cultural capital of the United States and have FUN doing it!

## Student Experience

The NYU High School Summer Art Intensive creates a close-knit community of young artists who experience the NYU Art Department much like our matriculated art majors during the academic year. We admit 54 students to our highly competitive in-person program; the group is divided into three intimate cohorts who take all studio classes together.

Students will work directly with practicing art professionals who bring a level of expertise in the field that only NYU can offer. We expect students to engage their courses rigorously to create ambitious works beyond a scope they may have previously explored at the high school level while learning about the New York world of contemporary art.

> I loved every part of this program, Living in this city is a dream come true. Thank you for this amazing opportunity that will be a part of me forever.
