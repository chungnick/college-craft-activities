Spend a full semester on Iowa State's vibrant campus as a Cyclone Scholar in the George Washington Carver Research Internship Program. As an intern in this program, you'll not only immerse yourself in groundbreaking research but also have the chance to experience campus life at a Big 12 university. Here's what to expect:

* **Explore food systems and building capacity across Iowa** to meet the human needs from things that grow through hands-on experiences
* **Receive personalized guidance** to navigate challenges and enhance your skills
* **Participate in professional development workshops** designed to boost your career prospects

We provide our scholars with a $8,000 stipend and a minimal travel allowance. Detailed information will be provided upon acceptance into the program.
