## Applications Open in November

Since 1931, the National High School Institute has brought outstanding students to Northwestern University’s Evanston campus for immersive educational experiences. Students are affectionately known as **“Cherubs,”** a name given to them in the 1930s by Northwestern Dean Ralph Dennis whose goal, “to bring together gifted young people and superior teachers in an atmosphere of affection, knowledge, and trust,” is still upheld today. The oldest and largest university-based program of its kind, NHSI offers studies in Theatre Arts, Film & Video, Debate, and Playwriting.
