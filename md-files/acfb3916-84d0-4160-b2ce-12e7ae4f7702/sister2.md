## Theatre Arts – Cost & Financial Aid Info

## Cost & Payment Information

## 2026 Tuition: $8,000

**Inclusive of tuition, fees, room, and board for 5 weeks**

*Need-based financial aid available*

The tuition price above covers all costs associated with attending the program, including tuition, room, board, and activity fees for things like program-wide field trips, tickets to see plays, etc. Not included is the cost of traveling to and from the program.

##### Deposit

If admitted and you accept your spot, we will create a student account for you which provides access to online billing. A **$1,000 non-refundable tuition deposit** will be required within 1 week of receiving your account information to reserve your spot in the Theatre Arts program. Once you’ve deposited, we will enroll you in the institute and that deposit will be credited toward your summer tuition. *If you are applying for Financial Aid from the NHSI, you will not be required to make a deposit until you have been notified of your aid award; you may be offered a discounted deposit.*

##### Remaining Balance

**The full tuition balance will post to your account on May 2, and is due by May 22, 2026**. Once posted, your deposit will be applied and your account will show the remaining tuition ($7,000). You can make payments toward your bill prior to May 2 and those payments will also show as credits on your student account until the bill posts, then be automatically applied. If payment for the full tuition balance is not received by May 22 and we have not heard from you, your spot will no longer be guaranteed and may be offered to someone on the waitlist.

If a student withdraws from NHSI before June 1, 2026, the University will refund 100% of payments made, **minus the non-refundable $1,000 deposit**.

**There will be no tuition refunds of any kind after June 1, 2026.** In the unlikely event that a student is dismissed from the program, tuition payments are non-refundable.

##### Other Fees

* $60 NHSI Application Fee for first application; $30 Application Fee for each subsequent application if applying to more than one concentration or division for the 2026 season.
* $45 FACTS Financial Aid Application Fee (collected directly through the FACTS application when you apply for financial aid.)

## Financial Aid & Scholarship Information

**If you are interested in applying to the Theatre Arts Division, you are encouraged to do so regardless of your financial status.** We urge all talented and passionate theatre students with need to apply for financial assistance. Each year a large number of our students receive significant financial aid. Do not miss out on this extraordinary opportunity due to financial restraints.

##### About NHSI Financial Aid

The NHSI offers financial aid in the form of scholarships, so all aid awarded by the NHSI does not need to be repaid. There is a limited pool of aid that can be awarded every summer, and that aid is awarded based on financial need only. The NHSI does not offer merit scholarships.

##### NHSI Financial Aid Application

The National High School Institute uses the **FACTS Financial Aid Application**, a secure platform maintained by Nelnet. Awards are made by the NHSI Financial Aid Committee on the basis of financial need. If you wish to apply for financial assistance, you simply need to confirm when applying for the Theatre Arts Institute; there is a question on the initial [application](https://nhsi.northwestern.edu/apply-now/). Then, you and your parent/guardians will receive instructions on how to apply for financial aid through FACTS. Please note, FACTS requires a separate $45 application fee as well as copies of your family’s 2024 tax return and 2025 W2’s, once available. If you cannot pay the $45 financial aid application fee (or the $60 program application fee), please contact our office before paying and we will make appropriate efforts to waive those fees.

*If you are an international student seeking aid, please know that funding is not available every year for international student aid. For the 2026 season, we do not anticipate financial aid being available for 2026 international students.*

**Financial Aid Applications follow the same deadlines as the application for admission:**

* **Early Admission Deadline**
  + January 2, 2026: Deadline to set up your FACTS profile and begin the FACTS application
  + January 9, 2026: All supporting documents must be uploaded to your FACTS application, and the application must be submitted for review
  + February 6, 2026: Students will be notified of their admission status and will have one week to accept their spot in the program. *Students will only be reviewed for financial aid once they have confirmed their intention to attend, should they receive the funding they require. No deposit will be required of financial aid applicants until after they have been considered for aid.*
* **Regular Admission Deadline**
  + February 27, 2026: Deadline to set up your FACTS profile and begin the FACTS application
  + March 6, 2026: All supporting documents must be uploaded to your FACTS application, and the application must be submitted for review
  + April 3, 2026: Students will be notified of their admission status and will have one week to accept their spot in the program. *Students will only be reviewed for financial aid once they have confirmed their intention to attend, should they receive the funding they require. No deposit will be required of financial aid applicants until after they have been considered for aid.*

##### Outside Funding Options

**We also encourage applicants to look into scholarship and Financial Aid options outside of the NHSI**, as the NHSI is rarely able to offer aid awards covering the full cost of the program. These outside funding sources can be a great way to make up the difference between an NHSI award and the full cost of attendance. Students may inquire with their school about Activities Funds, talk with the PTA, or local service clubs such as Rotary, Lions, Kiwanis, or AAUW. As well, past students have successfully run Go Fund Me and Kickstarter campaigns.

NHSI students have been awarded a scholarship from the [Anthony Quinn Foundation](https://aqfoundation.org/scholarships) for their summer attendance. **The application for the 2026 Anthony Quinn Foundation Scholarship is now open, with initial forms due November 30th, 2025.**

NHSI students have also been awarded scholarships from the [American Theatre Wing’s Andrew Lloyd Webber Initiative](https://alwinitiative.secure-platform.com/a/page/TrainingScholarships). There is no fee to apply. **[Application](https://atw.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/login/96?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fatw.secure-platform.com%2Fa%2Fsolicitations%2F96%2Fhome) now open, deadline is February 6, 2026.**
