# Camp Shule

**Camp Shule** combines fun, friendships, and adventure of camp with the excitement of intellectual inquiry and discovery.

Camp Shule provides an opportunity for youth to explore academic, artistic, and athletic interests in a relaxed and creative environment. Camp Shule encourages a life-long, love-of-learning with a combination of the best aspects of traditional camps close friendships, activities, and adventure with an element of intellectual inquiry and exploration. Camp Shule is based on the fundamental belief that children are good-decision makers, and make choices about their daily schedules which builds self-confidence, independence and maturity.
