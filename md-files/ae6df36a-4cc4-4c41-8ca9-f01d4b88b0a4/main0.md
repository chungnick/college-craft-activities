## **Inside the West Point Experience**

**Application for 2026 Summer Leaders Experience opens Feb. 15, 2026**

Led by current West Point cadets, Summer Leaders Experience (SLE) is a five-day immersion into a West Point cadet's academic, military, and social life. **SLE is for rising high school seniors** who are interested in learning more about West Point and the qualities required to succeed as a cadet.

SLE takes place the summer between your junior and senior year. **High school juniors should apply between 15 February and 15 April of their junior year.** To apply, complete the initial portion of the West Point application (Step 3 in our [Steps to Admission](/admissions/steps-to-admission)) and then the SLE checklist.

At SLE, you will explore West Point from all angles, including our high-tech academic facilities, team-building athletic activities, and realistic military training. You'll also gain firsthand insight into the character, determination, commitment to excellence, and leadership skills expected of West Point cadets.

### **Dates for Upcoming Sessions**

* **Session 1:** May 30-June 3, 2026
* **Session 2:** June 5-9, 2026
* **Session 3:** June 11-15, 2026

*An SLE application doubles as the first step of a West Point application. However, please note that an SLE application nor attending SLE obligates you to complete a West Point application or attend West Point.*

### **Be Part of a Team**

The cornerstone of an effective team is trust and respect. At SLE, you will build both with other top scholars, leaders, and athletes from around the country as you face complex and difficult challenges.

The program's academic, military, and physical components are demanding, but while overcoming SLE's challenges, you will form lifelong connections and friendships with your teammates.

### **Emerge as a Leader**

At SLE, every mission is an opportunity for you to emerge as the team member that others look to as an example. Throughout the program, you will be mentored by current West Point cadets who use their hard-won leadership skills to plan and guide your time at SLE.

See if you have what it takes to join the ranks of West Point's brightest scholars, athletes, and leaders from across the nation - your future classmates.

### **Overcome Academic Challenges**

West Point is continually ranked among the nation's top undergraduate public colleges.  Explore the outstanding academic opportunities West Point cadets experience every day.

During SLE, you will work in West Point's cutting-edge academic facilities and can customize your experience by choosing courses from various [academic disciplines](https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/departments).

### **Develop as an Athlete**

At West Point, every cadet is an athlete. SLE will challenge you with military fitness competitions and highlight West Point's athletics programs through forums with coaches from across the academy.

The Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA), required for West Point admission, is difficult. SLE also offers you a chance to get CFA training and advice from those who have passed to help maximize your athletic potential.

#### How much does SLE cost?

The cost of attendance is $495, but generous need-based scholarships are available. There is no application fee.

The cost covers clothing, supplies, meals, lodging, and instructor expenses. It does not cover travel to and from West Point.

Transportation to and from Newark Airport and West Point is provided.

[Ask a question about SLE costs](/directory/office-of-admissions)

#### What are the requirements for SLE?

Applicants must:

* be a high school junior (current year).
* be a U.S. citizen.
* be age 16 by 1 July of the summer between their junior and senior years.
* have no serious medical issues.

There are only 1,100 slots, and entry into the SLE program is highly competitive. The average attendee:

* has the following test\* score range:
  + SAT 1200-1300.
  + ACT 26-30.
* is in the top 20% of their class.
* is a member of the National Honor Society.
* participates in high school clubs.
* participates in extracurricular leadership activities.
* is in very good physical condition, a varsity letter winner, and/or team captain.

If you don't fit all of these categories, you should **STILL APPLY**. If your dream is to attend the United States Military Academy and become an Army officer, you have to try!

Many who attend SLE ultimately end up joining the Long Gray Line.

*\*Standardized test scores are not required, but the ideal applicant has a strong academic background and participates in team sports and other extracurricular activities.*

#### Does attending SLE help my admissions chances?

The Summer Leaders Experience is a tool that will help students understand why West Point might be a good fit for them. Attendance will help prospective cadets understand the full application process. However, it has no bearing on West Point admissions decisions.

By applying for the SLE, you are also opening an admissions file at the academy.
