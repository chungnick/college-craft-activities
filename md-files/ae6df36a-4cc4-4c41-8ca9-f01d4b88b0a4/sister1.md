## **A True No-Cost Education**

At West Point, we believe every cadet (student) needs to be free from financial worries so they can focus on academic success and becoming a leader of character in service to the nation.

Thus, West Point tuition is free.

West Point does not charge for room, board, or medical and dental coverage. Plus, cadets receive a salary covering all other fees, leaving them between $225 and $625 in monthly spending.

Every West Point graduate receives a top-tier education, unparalleled leadership training, and friends that will last a lifetime - all without incurring student loan debt or draining their parents’ savings.

## **Service Commitment**

West Point graduates serve as officers in the U.S. Army for a minimum of five years on active duty (full-time) and an additional three years in the reserve component (part-time) or Individual Ready Reserve.

At the beginning of their junior year, West Point cadets take an oath to fulfill this service obligation. Before doing so, cadets may leave West Point for whatever reason without incurring a service obligation.

Many West Point graduates make the Army their career, going on to become senior leaders and even general officers. Others serve their active duty commitment, gain highly valued leadership skills and experience, and move on to highly successful civilian careers.

## **Additional Financial Aid Information**

Since West Point is federally funded, it does not have a financial aid office. Cadets do not require scholarships or financial aid to fund their education at West Point.

However, if a cadet does receive an outside scholarship or their parents have College Plans, State 529 Plans, or EE Bonds, these funds can, under certain conditions, be used to pay the fees normally taken out of a cadet’s monthly salary.

Details on these subjects can be found in [the Cadet Budget](/cadet-journey/cadet-wellness#financial). Questions should be directed to the [Cadet Accounting Services Office (CASO)](mailto:g8_cadetbudgetfeedback@westpoint.edu.).
