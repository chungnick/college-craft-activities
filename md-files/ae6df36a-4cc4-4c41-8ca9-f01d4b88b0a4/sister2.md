## **Path to a World-Class, Tuition-Free Education Starts Here**

If you're a high school junior or senior who’s driven, physically active, and ready to lead, the United States Military Academy at West Point might be the place for you. West Point isn’t your typical college - it's a top-tier school that trains future leaders for the U.S. Army while providing a world-class education, all tuition-free.

Follow the steps below to start and complete your West Point application. You can also view the [application timeline](/admissions/steps-to-admissions-timeline) to help meet important deadlines. For help at any point during the application process or what you'll need to apply, please reach out to your [Regional Admissions Officer](/admissions/west-point-admissions-team).

Ready to lead? Here's how to apply!

## 1. Meet the Basic Requirements

To apply to USMA, you must meet several basic requirements. These ensure that applicants are academically, physically, and morally prepared for the demands of military and academic life.

* U.S. citizenship
* Age (17-22 on July 1 of the year of admission)

Not old enough to apply yet? Join the Admissions [mailing list](https://apply.westpoint.edu/register/requestforinformation) to stay in touch until you are.

[Explore FAQs about requirements](#requirements)

## 2. Take the ACT, SAT, or CLT

If you’re thinking about applying to West Point, one of the key steps is taking the ACT, SAT, or CLT\*. These standardized tests help West Point see how ready you are for the academic challenges of college-level work - especially in math, reading, and writing. They’re a big part of your overall application and can make a strong impact when it comes to standing out in a competitive applicant pool.

* Standardized tests are required.
* We superscore your results, combining your best scores from each subject across multiple test attempts.
* Official scores are due by Jan. 31 of your senior year.

**Pro tip:** You don't need your scores before submitting your application; you can update them until the Jan. 31 deadline.

Optional test sections (like ACT Science Reasoning or the ACT Writing Test) are not required.

\* The Classic Learning Test (CLT) will be accepted beginning in February 2026 for the West Point Class of 2031.

## 3. Submit Your Application

Applying to USMA is a big step - and it’s more than just filling out a form. It’s about showing that you’re ready to take on the challenge of becoming a future Army officer, student, and leader. The application process is detailed and competitive, but if you stay organized and start early, you’ve got this!

Be prepared with your information, including:

* Personal information (e.g., home address, date of birth, etc.)
* Schools attended
* [Congressional District](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=)
* Sport and extracurricular activities
* Self-reported GPA and test scores (if available)

**Pro tip:** To apply to our Summer Leaders Experience (SLE), complete this step and the SLE checklist before April of your junior year.

[Explore FAQs about online application](#application)

## 4. Obtain a Nomination

Before you can attend West Point, you’ll need a nomination, essentially an official endorsement from a U.S. government or military source confirming you have the character and leadership potential to succeed as a cadet. Nominations are more accessible than many people realize. Every U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, and the Vice President can nominate up to 15 candidates for each vacancy at West Point.

Most students apply for a nomination from:

* Both of their U.S. Senators (within their legislative district)
* Their U.S. Representative (within their legislative district)
* The Vice President of the United States

**Note:** Each nominating authority has its own application process and deadline, so read and follow instructions closely. Applications often include an essay, resume, letters of recommendation, and possibly an interview. You can - and should - apply to more than one source to boost your chances.

Locate your [Congressional Representative](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=) or [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm).

There are also special nominations for soldiers and the children of some military members.  These can be requested directly through your West Point application.

[Explore FAQs about nomination](#nominations)

## 5. Complete the CFA

West Point isn’t just about academics - it’s about building strong leaders who are mentally tough and physically fit. That’s why part of the application process includes the Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA), a test designed to measure your strength, speed, and endurance. The CFA show sthat you can handle the physical challenges of cadet life and military training.

The CFA series of physical tests can be administered:

* By a PE teacher
* By a Field Force Representative
* By a Military Academy Liaison Officer (MALO)
* By a U.S. military officer or non-commissioned officer from any service branch
* By a J/ROTC instructor
* Or while attending SLE

[Learn how to practice for the CFA](/admissions/steps-admission/candidate-fitness-assessment)

## 6. Pass the Medical Exam

To get into USMA, you don’t just need good grades and leadership skills. You also have to be medically fit for military service. That’s where the Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DoDMERB) comes in.

Once you start your West Point application and are officially considered a candidate, you’ll be scheduled for a medical exam. This exam checks your overall health to make sure you can safely handle the physical and mental demands of life as a cadet and future Army officer.

DoDMERB exams are provided at no cost to you.

**Note:** You will be notified to schedule a DoDMERB exam after West Point Admissions has reviewed your initial application (step 3) and confirmed your eligibility.

[Explore FAQs about the medical exam](#medical)

## 7. Complete Your Candidate Checklist

Applying to West Point is a serious commitment - there are a lot of steps, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. That’s why West Point recommend that you make yourself a candidate checklist.

This checklist is your go-to tool. A completed checklist will include:

* Official SAT or ACT scores
* Official school transcripts
* Essays, personal statement and/or resume
* Qualifying CFA scores
* Letters of recommendation from three teachers
* Updated records of sport and extracurricular activities
* Nomination(s)

**Your candidate checklist must be completed by Jan. 31 of your senior year.**

**Note:** Your candidate file in the [Application Portal](https://apply.westpoint.edu/portal/candidate) is complete when we have received your application (step 3), your nomination (step 4), your qualifying medical exam (step 6), and your completed Candidate Checklist (step 7).

## **Eligibility FAQS**

#### I'm younger than the age requirement. How can I prepare?

Many middle school and early high school students are already interested in attending West Point. You may have a relative who served in the military or heard about West Point from a current cadet on a hometown visit. However you learned about West Point, it is never too early to begin preparing for your success!

[Explore tips for preparing to apply to West Point](/admissions/steps-to-admission/middle-high-school)

#### I'm an international student. Can I apply to West Point?

Yes!  International cadets are fully assimilated into the Corps of Cadets. Their four-year experience here is identical to that of U.S. cadets.

Up to 60 international cadets may study at West Point at any given time. Eligible countries are selected on an annual basis by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense. The American embassies notify invited nations to nominate up to six candidates per country to compete for admission to West Point.

To apply for admission to West Point, contact the [U.S. Defense Attaché Office](http://www.usembassy.gov/) at the American Embassy in your country. This office serves as the link between the student, the host nation, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

The application process for international students is essentially the same as that for U.S. citizens; however, you must be sponsored by a national-level government official.

#### I'm a current soldier. Is my application process different?

The application steps are the same for soldiers; however, soldiers can obtain a nomination from their company commanders and are automatically considered for the Preparatory School if not directly admitted to West Point.

As a soldier, you must be assessed by your company or lowest-level unit commander. While this assessment constitutes a nomination, Soldiers are also strongly encouraged to obtain additional nominations from your [Congressional representative](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=) or [senator](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm).

If you are academically disqualified, you will be automatically considered for admission to the [United States Military Academy Preparatory School (USMAPS)](https://nsd.linksolstaging.com/us-military-academy-preparatory-school), where you may later be considered for admission to West Point.

For more information, please visit our [Information for Current Soldiers page](/admissions/steps-to-admission/current-soldiers).

[Contact the Soldiers Admissions Team](/admissions/west-point-admissions-team#soldiers)

#### I'm an athlete who would like to be considered for recruitment. What should I do?

West Point is home to 25 Division I sports for both men and women.  If you would like to be considered for recruitment, your first step is to [fill out the coach's questionnaire](https://goarmywestpoint.com/sports/2015/3/6/GEN_201401012.aspx) under the "Recruiting" tab for your respective sport.

NOTE:  The coaches for Men's Football and Men's Ice Hockey must be contacted directly via email or phone.

If your file is competitive for consideration to the Academy, you will be given the opportunity to complete the application process regardless of recruitment in your sport.

For more information, call (845) 938-5723 or email the [Recruited Athlete / Congressional Liaison Officer](mailto:nathan.santhanam@westpoint.edu).

[Contact the Athletics Admissions Team](/admissions/west-point-admissions-team#athletes)

#### Do you accept transfer students?

No. Students in college or with previous college credit may apply to West Point if they meet the basic requirements. However, those students still enter West Point as plebes (freshmen) and must complete the four-year program.

#### I'm a naturalized citizen. What additional documentation will you need?

You will need to provide one of the following:

* United States passport
* Your original citizenship certificate
* Immigration & Naturalization Service Citizenship Verification form G-639 (preferred)

#### What is the tattoo policy at West Point?

West Point's tattoo policy is dictated by Army Regulation 670-1. Below is a synopsis of the Army policy, including tattoo placement and a description of tattoos that are not authorized.  
   
**Unauthorized Tattoo Locations:**

## **Requirements FAQs**

#### What are the academic requirements?

Academics account for about 60% of your application score. This is a combination of your high school grades and your standardized test scores. When making our student acceptance decisions, we will look at your transcripts for freshman, sophomore, junior, and first-semester senior years.

To qualify academically at West Point, you should have an above-average high school or college academic record.  Candidates must take, at a minimum, either trigonometry or pre-calculus before entering West Point.  We also strongly encourage taking physics, chemistry, or both.  A complete transcript of your academic achievement will be evaluated to determine your qualifications.  Should you not have taken trigonometry or pre-calculus, you may be eligible for a preparatory school path.

You should perform well on the ACT, SAT or CLT\*. These tests indicate your potential for academic success during your first year in college.

Optional test sections (like ACT Science Reasoning or the ACT Writing Test) are not required.

\*The Classic Learning Test (CLT) will be accepted beginning in February 2026 for the West Point Class of 2031.

#### What are the leadership requirements?

To make your application strong, you are encouraged to take part in extracurricular activities that demonstrate leadership skills and potential.  Examples include, but are not limited to, Eagle Scouts, Girl Scout Gold Award, sports team captain, class leadership positions, club leadership positions, and American Legion Boys/Girls State programs. In general, it is better to seek leadership positions within just a few extracurriculars than to just participate in many.

#### What are the physical requirements?

The Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA) consists of six events: basketball throw, pull-ups (men & women)/flexed-arm hang (women who cannot do one pull-up), shuttle run, modified sit-ups, push-ups, and one mile run. You are permitted just one examination, and you should practice the six events prior to taking the examination.

#### What are the medical requirements?

You must be in good physical and mental health and pass a Department of Defense qualifying medical examination.

**Are there any COVID-19-related requirements?**     
No. Effective Feb. 22, 2023, COVID-19 vaccinations are no longer mandatory for admission to the United States Military Academy or the United States Military Academy Preparatory School.

**Is 20/20 eyesight required for qualification?**  
No, but your eyesight must be correctable to 20/20 with glasses or contact lenses.

[Back to top](#step1)

## **College Exam FAQs**

#### When should I take the college entrance exams?

Take the SAT, ACT, or CLT\* as early and often as practicable. If you are a junior, it is to your advantage to take a standardized test by the end of your junior year.  Check SAT, ACT, and CLT websites for test dates.

\* The Classic Learning Test (CLT) will be accepted beginning in February 2026 for the West Point Class of 2031

#### How can I improve my scores?

We recommend using the results of your first standardized test to identify areas where you can study and improve for a retest, and to make your application more competitive. Retest if needed, and send us the results of all the tests that you take. We will combine your best subject scores from multiple tests to make the best total score.

The SAT, ACT, and CLT websites have free materials to help you prepare for these tests.

#### How should I submit my scores?

Unofficial scores may be used to submit your initial application, but a completed application must have official scores sent directly from the testing service.

* For SAT, use the USMA school code 2924.
* For ACT, use the USMA school code 2976.
* For CLT, select United States Military Academy when sharing scores.

#### What do I need to know about taking a standardized test?

The standardized test you take must be timed. We encourage applicants to take and submit multiple tests, and since we superscore your results, we will use the test scores in which you performed the best.

[Back to top](#step1)

## **Application FAQs**

#### What should I know about high school transcripts?

To submit your transcripts, complete the Candidate Checklist item called "Request for Academic Information."  You'll need the name and email of someone at your school who can sent your transcript, typically your high school's counselor.  West Point will send them a request to submit your transcript directly to us.  Initially, they will need to send a high school transcript through at least your junior year (6 semesters).  Later in the process, you will need to submit your transcript through the first half of your senior year (7 semester transcript).  If you are offered admission, you will also need to submit your final high school transcript.

**Transcripts must:**

* Be official copies
* Submitted electronically by an official at your high school
* If you attended more than one high school, the overall requirements are the same.

If you have further questions about your transcripts, please communicate directly with your [Regional Commander](https://www.westpoint.edu/admissions/west-point-admissions-team).

#### Who should I ask for school official evaluations (recommendation letters)?

Applicants must be evaluated by three school officials. You will enter the school officials contact information into your application, and West Point will contact them directly to complete the evaluation.

**You must have evaluations from:**

* A high school English teacher or college English instructor/professor
* A high school math teacher or college math instructor/professor
* A high school lab science teacher or college lab science instructor/professor (physics or chemistry)

#### What is a candidate statement?

All candidates are required to compose responses to two topics listed in the application. You must complete your statements before your admissions file is evaluated. Since the responses will be reviewed and evaluated, we highly recommend that you take your time composing the responses before submitting them.

#### Where can I get help with my application?

If you have specific questions not answered by these FAQ, contact your [regional admissions team](https://www.westpoint.edu/admissions/west-point-admissions-team) either by email or by phone during business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m. Eastern Time).

[Back to top](#step1)

## **Nominations FAQs**

#### What is the difference between Congressional nominations and service-connected nominations?

Congressional nominations are competitive and awarded by members of Congress (Senators and Congresspersons). The individual members of Congress determine their own selection criteria and application procedures. Members of Congress can make up to 15 nominations for each vacancy at West Point.

Service-connected nominations are typically not competitive and are instead automatically conferred when a candidate meets certain criteria relating to their own or their parents' military service. For example, if you currently service in the Army reserve, you are eligible for a nomination based on that service (with your commander's endorsement), or if either of your parents' meet the criteria for "career military" (see "What is the nomination process for children of career military personnel" accordion below for more details), then you are eligible for a nomination based on their service.

Receiving a nomination is required before a candidate can be offered admissions, but a nomination does not guarantee a candidate will be offered admission.

#### How do I apply for a nomination from my Congressperson or Senator?

To apply for a nomination from your Congressional Representative or Senators, you will need to apply directly through their office. Each has their own process and requirements, so you will need to visit their specific websites to find out what is needed. Follow these links to locate your [Congressional Representative](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=) or [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Typically, Service Academy Nomination information is listed under "Services" on their websites.

Typically, you will submit high school transcripts, standardized test scores, essays, and letters of recommendation, but you may need to submit other items based on the specific requirements of your Representative or Senator.

Nomination application deadlines vary depending on the office, but typically they are due between late September and late October. Make sure to check your Senators and Congresspersons websites for their individual deadlines.

#### Who is eligible for a service-connected nomination?

* Those enlisted in the Army (Active, Reserve, and National Guard)
* Members of Army Junior and Senior Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) Units and Honor ROTC Units of other services
* Children of deceased or disabled veterans and children of prisoners of war or service members missing in action
* Children of Medal of Honor Awardees
* Children of career military personnel (parent must be on active duty and have served continuously for 8 years or be in the Reserves and have the equivalent reserve points)

#### What is the nomination process for active duty, Reserve, or National Guard Soldiers?

To secure a nomination, soldiers (active duty, Reserve, or National Guard) must have a letter of endorsement from their commander.

#### What is the nomination process for Army Junior and Senior ROTC programs and Honor ROTC Units of other services?

* Applicants currently enrolled in an Army Junior or Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program or an ROTC program from another branch of service that has been designated as an Honor Unit with Distinction are eligible for a nomination in this category.
* To assess your eligibility and begin this nomination process, complete the Service Connected Nomination Eligibility Questionnaire in your candidate portal.

#### What is the nomination process for children of career military personnel?

Applicants must furnish a statement of service, retirement orders, or casualty report to verify eligibility for this nomination.

**Career military personnel**, for the purpose of service-connected nominations, are defined as:

* members of an Armed Force (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard) who are
  + currently on active duty (other than for training) with at least eight years of continuous active-duty service,
  + who are retired with pay or granted retired or retainer pay
  + who died while they were, retired with pay or granted retired or retainer pay.
* Service members currently serving in the reserve component who are credited with at least eight continuous years of service computed under section 12733 of Title 10, United States Code
* Reservists who:
  + would be entitled to retirement pay except for not having attained 60 years of age
  + who died while they would have been entitled to retirement pay except for not having attained 60 years of age

*NOTE:  A stepparent's military service is applicable for this category only if the applicant was adopted.*

## **Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA) FAQs**

#### How do I practice for the CFA?

Work on improving your general fitness level, but especially your upper-body strength and your one-mile run. The pull-up/flexed arm hang, pushups, and one-mile run are the most physically demanding events. Also practice all of the events and give yourself a practice test following all of the instructions. Ensure you practice each event to the standards shown in the videos available on Step 5 of Steps to Admissions page.

#### How soon should I begin practicing for the CFA?

Begin practicing the events in the Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA) NOW! It is harder than you think. For more information, please read the full CFA Instructions. After you have practiced each event enough to become familiar, we recommend that you put yourself through a full practice assessment.

When you take the CFA for an official score, you will have to complete the events consecutively with a 3-minute rest period between the first five events and an 8-minute rest before beginning the final one-mile run event.

[Back to top](#step1)

## **Medical Examination FAQs**

#### When should I take my medical exam?

Take your medical exam as soon as possible after it is available, as it can take several months to get qualified. The Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DoDMERB) manages all medical exams, and you will be notified by DoDMERB when your exam is available. If you have not been notified by DoDMERB by the fall of your senior year, contact your [regional Admissions Officer.](/admissions/west-point-admissions-team)

#### What should I bring to my medical exam?

When you visit an approved doctor for your military physical (medical exam), bring copies of all your medical documents with you that pertain to broken bones, allergies, skin diseases, etc. Even if minor, personal medical conditions may become an issue further down the line. It is always better to clear up any medical questions in advance when we still have time to help you overcome any possible setbacks. If you have had any broken bones, you will need a letter from your doctor explaining that "you have returned to full rigorous activities with no limitations.”
