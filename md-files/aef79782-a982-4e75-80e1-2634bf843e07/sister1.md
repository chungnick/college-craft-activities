# About the Program

---

The Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP) is an academic enrichment program for students from first generation and low-income high school juniors. Over five weeks, participants engage in faculty lectures, professional development workshops, Stanford Medicine networking events, and a public health disparities research project. During the program and beyond, participants are mentored by faculty, health professionals, and college students on preparing for college, navigating careers in medicine, and becoming a leader today.

## Jump to:

Our 2026 program will be held on Stanford’s campus **June 22nd - July 26th, 2026**. The 2026 SMYSP Program Application is now available! **Deadline to apply is March 23, 2026.** Please click the button below.

[Apply now](https://stanfordodme.slideroom.com/#/login/program/87372)

## SMYSP Program Details

Our 2026 program will be held on Stanford’s campus June 22nd - July 26th, 2026. SMYSP is a full-time weekly summer program. Students will be expected to travel to Stanford’s main campus Monday through Friday for the duration of the program. Our team of dedicated program staff, including program counselors and instructors, will work together to create a supportive, enriching, and exciting summer experience with SMYSP. Our counselors will plan a variety of fun team building exercises throughout the week.

Please note a mandatory in-person program orientation will be held Thursday, **June 18th, 2026**. Applicants accepted into the program will receive a detailed program schedule.

### What to Expect

Students will divide their time between the following activities:

## Stanford Hospital Internship

Students are placed in hospital internships throughout Stanford Hospital. SMYSP students study not only the factual knowledge of health and medical science but also gain experience in the various aspects of health care delivery such as hands-on laboratory and departmental activities, shadowing experiences and observation, and patient interaction.

These internships provide exposure to the various health and medical professions through hands-on activities, shadowing, as well as formal and informal discussions, and support students to gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the science and medical professions.

## Public Health Research Project

Participants engage in a health disparities group research project to improve health and health access in all communities. Students will work in small groups to write a college-level research paper, presentation, and academic poster. Examples of research projects include addressing racial inequities in COVID-19 health outcomes, examining low birth outcomes for African American mothers, and combatting language barriers in hospital settings.

## Community Building and Mentorship

We foster opportunities for participants to develop enduring friendships and support systems that last long beyond the summer program. Our passionate team of mentors and counselors support participants to build their confidence, develop a college action plan, and reach their full potential.

## Academic Seminars and Lectures

Students will attend two weekly lectures covering the field of public health and research methodology in order to prepare them to complete their summer research project.

Additionally, students will attend two weekly lectures covering human anatomy with Stanford medical student instructors as well as participate in a weekly academic planning workshop in preparation for applying to college in the fall of 2024. Academic planning workshops include creating a college action plan, applying for financial aid, what admissions officers look for, and writing college essays.

## Immersive Educational Opportunities

Students will participate in weekly guest lectures, tours, and demonstrations from the Stanford medical community. Potential guests include Dermatology, Anesthesiology, Life Flight, Gastroenterology, Ophthalmology, and more.
