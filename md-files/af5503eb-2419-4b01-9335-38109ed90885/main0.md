#### **Pre-College applications for summer 2026 opens September 23.**

At CCA’s Pre-College Program, you’ll join a diverse group of creative thinkers and makers who share your passion for art and design. The program is open to all interested participants, those with little art and design experience and those with advanced skills.

We offer on-campus housing as well as meal plans for residential and commuter students.

Participants will have the opportunity to take studio-focused, college-level courses to help push beyond concepts to portfolio-ready pieces while earning 3 college credits.

**In-person:**

July 6-July 31, 2026 (4 weeks)

Our setting is the CCA San Francisco campus. Our backdrop is the San Francisco Bay Area, home to tech companies, world-class museums, and a dynamic ecosystem of artists, designers, and creatives from across the globe.
