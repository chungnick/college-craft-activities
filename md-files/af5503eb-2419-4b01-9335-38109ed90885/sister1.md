## International Students - Next Steps for F1 Visa Application for US Entry

### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once you have confirmed enrollment by submitting deposit payment, please review next steps and resource links with information to obtain your [Form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/prepare/students-and-the-form-i-20) and prepare for F1 Visa application to enter the US to participate in the CCA Pre-College program!

Next Steps:

* Complete and submit the CCA ISS I-20 Request Form for Pre-College and return it with all supporting documents to International Student Services (ISS): iss@cca.edu
* Once I-20 has been received from CCA, make an appointment with the [US Embassy/Consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) to apply for F1 Visa
* Make travel arrangements to arrive in the US and to CCA before Pre-College move-in date. F-1 students can enter the US within the 30 days before the program starts.
* Attend required Pre-College F1 Student Check-In ISS Orientation to confirm arrival at CCA

[Study in the States](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/financial-ability) is a very helpful official US government resource with a step by step guide to becoming an F1 student.

[EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/find-advising-center) (we recommend "comprehensive" offices only) may be a good resource for specific advice or questions about the F1 Visa application for citizens from your home country.

Please contact International Student Services [iss@cca.edu](mailto:iss@cca.edu) with questions or for assistance.
