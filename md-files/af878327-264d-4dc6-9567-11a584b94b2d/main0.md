# STEP Program at Georgia Tech

Image

### **What is STEP?**

The Science, Technology and Engineering Pipeline (STEP) program is a free summer camp (beginning in June) for Atlanta-area high school students where students learn the engineering design process through completing NASA-inspired challenges.

STEP is sponsored by Lockheed Martin, the Aerospace Systems Design Lab (ASDL), and the Georgia Space Grant Consortium (GSGC).

### **What will students do?**

Over the course of three weeks, students will take a crash course in the engineering design process led by AE School faculty and students. With the help of mentors and the Yang Aero Maker Space, students will be able to have their designs come to life. During the final day of camp, students will present their final designs to their fellow camper, friends, family, and STEP sponsors.

Previous camp missions have included:

* design an autonomous rover that can navigate a course
* modify a base-line model rover with technology that would be useful for future missions to Mars
* create an ultra-light rover that can complete a course in the least amount of time

If you know an Atlanta-area high school student who may be interested in the program or would like to learn more, contact [email]

### **How can I get involved?**

Volunteer opportunities are available to current Georgia Tech aerospace engineering students. If you'd like to serve as a mentor, please contact <outreach@gatech.edu>.
