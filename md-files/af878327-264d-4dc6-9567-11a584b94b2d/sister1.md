## [**S.T.E.P. at Georgia Tech**](https://gasgc.org/wp/gtae-step/)

The Science, Technology and Engineering Program (STEP) is a free summer camp (beginning in June) for Atlanta-area high school students where they learn the engineering design process through completing NASA-inspired challenges.

Over the course of three weeks, students will take a crash course in the engineering design process led by AE School faculty and students. With the help of mentors and the Yang Aero Maker Space, students will be able to have their designs come to life. During the final day of camp, students will present their final designs to their fellow camper, friends, family, and STEP sponsors.

STEP is sponsored byLockheed Martin, Boeing, the Georgia Center of Innovation for Aerospace, the Georgia Space Grant Consortium, and Georgia Tech’s Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory.

[STEP Mentor Application Open (GTAE Students)](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=u5ghSHuuJUuLem1_Mvqgg0rlF6SKMcVBtoIY3h6kiilUOU4wNTQ2VDFLTVM3SkpFUldSNEdNRlEyMC4u)

Undergrad: $12/hr  
Graduate: Fellowship stipend

## [**Georgia Space Grant Consortium (GSGC)**](https://gasgc.org/wp/)

The Georgia Space Grant Consortium (GSGC) was established in 1989 to develop a statewide network of academic, industry, and non-profit partners dedicated to maximize the number of Georgia students from all backgrounds who are well-prepared in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and who are motivated to support space and aeronautics programs vital to this nation.

GSGC is a**[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)**program and part of the**[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/spacegrant/home/Space_Grant_Consortium_Websites.html#.U86RXhDYOJ0)**.

## [**Tuskegee Airmen Global (TAG) Academy**](/tuskegee-airmen-global-academy-and-georgia-tech)

n the spring of 2021, the AE School and the Tuskegee Airmen Global  (TAG) Academy joined forces to expand access to STEM education. The partnership focuses on K-12 curriculum and resources provided by the AE School and the Georgia Space Grant Consortium. AE faculty and students prepare lessons and interactive workshops to teach aerospace fundamentals that can be easily grasped by young learners.

“Our goal is to be a long-term partner with the Academy and provide support and resources for their entire school as needed,” said **Mark Costello**, William R.T. Oakes Professor and AE School chair. “We want to foster continuous engagement with our local school systems to help instill the importance of STEM education starting at an early age.”
