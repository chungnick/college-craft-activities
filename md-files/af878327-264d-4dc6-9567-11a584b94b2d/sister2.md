**Majors**: AE, CS  
**Preferred Skills**: Python, agent-based simulation, Reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, supervised learning, unsupervised learning  
**Details**: The landscape of future military engagements is constantly evolving due to the introduction of new technologies and tactics resulting in complex, highly dynamic battlespace environments. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies now enable systems to operate autonomously in complex and contested battlespaces. This capability can remove previous operational constraints which enable an actor to deploy large swarms of autonomous systems to achieve mission success. Additionally, these large swarms can effectively collaborate, acting as a force multiplier, to produce even greater effects. A shortcoming of these AI systems is the need for vast amounts of accurate data to properly develop, test, and evaluate. There is also a lack of standardization of this data and a common testing arena for the developed AI systems. This project focuses on the development, training and, evaluation of various multi-agent AI architectures for use within networked, collaborative autonomous applications.

Details: The concept of rotational artificial gravity has been explored in futurism and science fiction for decades for long-term space habitation, but it is unclear if the atmospheres of such objects would be stable without a gravity well confining them. As such, this project will investigate the feasibility of containing atmospheres using rotational gravity in large space habitats and quantifying the loss rates thereof. The Low-Gravity Science and Technology Laboratory is looking for students with interests in fluid modeling for (i) collisionless and collisional fluids, (ii) statistical simulation, (iii) initial value problems, and (iv) mass balances. The final grade is dependent on participation in weekly meetings and research contributions. (edited)

**Project: Aerial and Ground Wildfire Fighting Operations Research**  
**Can this work be performed remotely or online, if needed?** Not completely. In-person meetings are required.  
**Project Manager:**Dr. Burak Bagdatli  
**Action:**Email your resume to Dr. Burak Bagdatli (burak.bagdatli@ae.gatech.edu)  
**Office:** Weber 303  
**Semesters:** Start in Fall and Spring, can continue in Summer   
**Time Commitment:**4‒8 hrs per week (1 to 2 credits)  
**Number of Students Needed:**1‒2 motivated students. Open to any major and program.  
**Citizenship Requirement:** No  
**GPA Requirement:**3.5+ preferred, 3.2 minimum  
**Details:**Wildland fires pose a pervasive threat, characterized by sudden occurrences and the potential for widespread damage to lives and property. The impact of climate change intensifies fire seasons, making wildfires increasingly difficult to manage. In the United States, significant resources, both federally funded and privately owned, are dedicated to firefighting operations, exhibiting a well-organized and managed approach. Globally, the problem remains the same for each country; however, with different systems, tactics, and climate! Our research aims to be all-inclusive with creating geographical data layers and description of systems and tactics.  
  
This research aims at improving wildfire fighting operations by modeling the operations in agent-based simulation environments and observing the impacts of new technologies, changing tactics, and dedicating more resources to the operations. ASDL has been working with Lockheed Martin and Saab on this project and has been receiving interest in our work from entities such as NASA and the FAA. Come join our team and help us build the environment to test new operational tactics. Familiarity with Python is required. If you have skills in GIS software, we’d love to have you as part of the team! Additional programming language experience would be a bonus (Rust, C++, etc.) but not a requirement.

**Can this work be performed remotely or online, if needed?**No  
**Number of Students Needed:** 6  
**Citizenship Requirement:**No  
**GPA Requirement:**3.7+ preferred; 3.5 minimum    
**Seniority Requirement:** 3rd year + students with a background in plant biology AND/OR hardware development / machining AND/OR machine learning / artificial intelligence    
**Majors:**AE-only  
**Action:**Submit your application using [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/Z1QXTuSUQX) before Phase II registration starts. Successful applicants will be notified before the beginning of the semester.    
**Details:**A 3-year 6-crewmember mission to Mars requires ~11,000 kg of food with an 18-20% packaging mass overhead. With launch costs of the order of 23,000 USD/kg, bioregenerative life support systems are widely regarded as a promising approach to reduce future upmass requirements and provide supplementary nutrients to the crew. Plant chambers seek to address the second objective, but existing designs onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are faced with multiple challenges associated with the lack of effective gravity and the need for reliable food production methods. The [Low-Gravity Science and Technology Laboratory](https://lowgravitylab.ae.gatech.edu/spacecraft-propellant-sloshing/) is looking for students with a strong interest in space biology to (i) design and build an ISS-like plant chamber with temperature, humidity, air, water, and light control, (ii) test spaceflight-compatible crops in preparation for future missions, (iii) develop novel hydroponic and porous plant watering systems for partial-gravity environments, and (iv) train environmental monitoring ML/AI algorithms using hyperspectral imaging. Students enrolled in this URO program will be asked to complete a series of homework assignments aimed at providing a basic background on the topic.

**Semesters:**Ongoing long-term effort  
**Time Commitment:**About 6-9 hrs per week (flexible). Scales with the number of credit hours registered for undergraduate research.  
Can this work be performed remotely or online, if needed? Yes, but active participation is required  
**Number of Students Needed:** 10-15  
**Citizenship Requirement:**No  
**GPA Requirement:**3.7+ preferred; 3.5 minimum

**Details:**The term “sloshing” describes the movement of liquids in partially filled containers. Sloshing is key for aerospace applications because it can significantly alter the dynamics of space vehicles or prevent propellant ingestion into their engines. Although research on liquid sloshing has been carried out for the last 70 years, multiple questions remain at the fundamental and applied levels. The [Low-Gravity Science and Technology Laboratory](https://lowgravitylab.ae.gatech.edu/spacecraft-propellant-sloshing/) is looking for students with a strong interest in rocket propulsion to (i) develop analytical open-access tools in Python or Matlab to study the sloshing of propellants in launch stages, (ii) build and operate an automated sloshing damping testbed for tank characterization, (iii) design and launch sounding rocket experiments to validate dynamic models assessing fluid-structure interactions, and (iv) study the behavior of propellants in simulated low-gravity conditions using neutral buoyancy mixtures. First-time students are required complete four homework assignments based on [NASA’s SP-106](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19670006555/downloads/19670006555.pdf) and F.T. Dodge’s “The New Dynamic Behavior of Liquids in Moving Containers” prior to joining the research subgroups. The final grade is dependent on the completion of these assignments, participation in weekly meetings, and research contributions.
