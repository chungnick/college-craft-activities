## Supervision

* STEM 9/10 is a structured and supportive experience and is ideal for students with limited experience away from home or those who appreciate the highly planned nature of the program.
* STEM 9/10 students gain valuable skills as they learn to navigate life in a college setting, including time management, personal maturity, independence and academic integrity. These experiences, both in and out of the classroom, will help students be more successful in their future academic pursuits.
* STEM 9/10 students are supported by a team of carefully selected Resident Assistants (RAs), Area Coordinators and professional staff members. The Brown Pre-College Student Life team oversees the safety of all students while the program is in session. RAs live in the residence hall with students. Built into a framework of support and mentorship, RAs lead floor meetings during the two-week program and facilitate ongoing community-building experiences. They also supervise students during evening and weekend "fundatory” (mandatory fun) activities.
