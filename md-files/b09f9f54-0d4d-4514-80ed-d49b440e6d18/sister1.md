# Undergraduate Pathways Network Summer Research Program (UPN)

The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center has a longstanding tradition of training undergraduates in the biomedical sciences through summer research programs.  

The UNMHSC Undergraduate Pathways Network (UPN) program is an umbrella program that brings together undergraduates conducting summer biomedical research across the UNMHSC campus with the goal of cultivating students' interest in research while helping them attain skills needed to apply for and succeed in post-baccalaureate education. The program provides the opportunity for approximately 50 scholars to choose from several areas of research at the University of New Mexico's Health Sciences Center.  Several different research programs participate as part of the UPN experience, which includes seminars, career development opportunities, and social activities. 

Each scholar is mentored during the program by a faculty member. In addition, scholars will have regular contact with a graduate student, post-doctoral fellow, medical resident, clinical fellow, or research staff member during the entire period of their program. Each scholar will have a research project that provides the student with sufficient opportunity to demonstrate their ability to conduct independent research. Finally, scholars will present their research project to the scientific community during the program’s competitive poster symposium. 

The UPN Program period covers 10 weeks in the summer and scholars participate in the program full time (35-40 hr/wk). The program awards each scholar a summer experience package, which includes housing, tuition, activity fees, some meals, and a $6000 research stipend.

### **Research Programs participating in the UPN summer research experience include:**

* [American Heart Association Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE)](unm-sure-program.html)
* [American Cancer Society Diversity in Cancer Research Internship Program](https://unmhealth.org/cancer/career/training-education/dicr-program.html )
* [Cancer Research – Scholarship and Training in Population Sciences (C-STEPS)](https://unmhealth.org/cancer/career/training-education/csteps.html )
* [NM INBRE Summer Research Experience](https://nminbre.org/nise-overview/ )

The program is designed to cultivate an interest in research through exposure to various types of research, develop of research skills and prepare participants for graduate education in the health and social sciences.  It includes elements that strive to increase students’ competency in:

* Presentation skills
* Preparing graduate program applications (essay writing and interview skills)
* Working with mentors
* Professional skills and research etiquette
* Responsible conduct of research
* Being a member of a multi-disciplinary team
* Understanding options for careers in scientific research

UPN Scholars are exposed to the opportunity to learn about research activities in different settings via the UPN seminar and cohort-building activities.

### UPN Scholars are expected to:

* Give full-time commitment to their research
* Attend the weekly seminar series
* Attend all activities
* Prepare a poster and present their research at a poster symposium
* Complete all evaluations in a timely manner
* Treat all members of the UNM community in a respectful manner, recognizing the impact that their attitude may have on others

### **What Participants Say About UPN**

### **UPN Scholars Comments:**

* *I would like to thank the program for giving me this opportunity and matching me with such an awesome mentor. Thank you*
* *I liked how much I grew as a scientist. I was forced out of my c**omfort zone and that was beneficial. This experience has provided me with critic**al r**easoning skills that are invaluable as I move forward. Also, the networking was great.*
* *My community isn’t full of scholars and this experience gave me the confirmation that I should continue research. At a very basic level, I can be a role model for m**y community.*
* *Thank you for being passionate about what you do by going above and beyond during the UPN program to help us find opportunities and funding for those opportunities. It reminds me that nothing is ever impossible no matter how tough it may seem. Nothing is ever too big to accomplish. I will never fo**rget how much the UPN program  helped me and motivated me by opening new doors and sparking an interest in research.*
* *I am very excited for all the wonderful opportunities the UPN program has brought to me. I believe a lot of the UPN students just went to SACNAS conference, I hope that went well! Your program has helped so many of us in so many ways. Thank you!*
* *I’m excited to keep pursuing my research goals, and I’m not sure I would be where I am today if it wasn’t for all that I gained from the UPN experience **…***

### **UPN Mentor Comments:**

* *This UPN experience has been truly rewarding this year. My student has been a wonderful addition to the lab. I wish we could keep her.*
* *My student has excelled in every aspect of learning: experimental skills, subject knowledge, collegiality with peers and mentors.  Thanks for a great match.*
* *Great work with UPN, it was a fabulous summer with my student. Thanks for making this program possible.*
* *Keep renewing [the program]!*
* *It’s fun to have young people around and watch them grow.*
* *It’s a lot of work, and for 10 weeks, you’re worried about them; are they going to succeed and do well? Am I giving them all I can possibly give them? But it’s fun, really fun.*
