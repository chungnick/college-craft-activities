## The Bowdoin Festival Experience

At the Festival, we foster the growth of our musicians through the study of solo and chamber music repertoire. With about 275 students on campus each summer (typically 175 per session), we cultivate personal attention, encouragement, and nurturing in a setting that includes a broad range of collaborative and supportive relationships and hundreds of opportunities to learn, rehearse, and perform. Our blend of conservatory and music school-based faculty represents some of the most respected musicians who maintain active performing profiles along with a proven commitment to teaching and mentoring young musicians.

At the Festival we are always looking for ways, through music, to make each other's lives better and lift one another up. When you're part of a community like that, it's really powerful and life changing.

Students  are housed in Bowdoin College dorms and apartment buildings. During the enrollment process, accepted students may indicate roommate requests.

* Dorms are monitored by student and staff Resident Assistants
* Typically double occupancy rooms
* A pillow, linens, towel, and a blanket provided (hangers are not provided)
* Washers and dryers are available in every residence hall (laundry detergent is not provided).
* Students 17 and under have curfew

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided by the award-winning Bowdoin College dining hall. Students describe the food as “exceptional” and “amazing.” Meals are a great time to socialize with chamber groups and friends, connect with Festival faculty and staff, and meet other students.

**Dining Hall Hours**  
Breakfast: 7:00 AM – 9:00 AM  
Lunch: 11:30 AM – 1:30 PM  
Dinner: 5:00 PM – 7:00 PM

The Festival’s Residence Life team works hard to make the environment at the Festival supportive, caring, and fun. They offer a variety of activities including off-campus trips:

* Bradbury Mountain
* Cliffs Trail costal hike
* Monhegan Island
* Pemaquid Point Lighthouse
* Popham Beach
* Soccer games
* Yoga sessions
* Fresh seafood at coastal restaurants
* Visits to art museums

We use the facilities of Bowdoin College during the six-week Festival. A small, beautiful, and safe campus, students can walk from one side to the other in under ten minutes. Students are housed in Bowdoin College dorms and apartment building and have access to Bowdoin’s libraries (including Beckwith Music Library), museums, athletic complex, and playing fields. Performances take place in the college’s state-of-the-art Studzinski Recital Hall.

Our Instrumental Program is open to students 15 and up, with a typical range of 15–30. About 25% of our students are pre-college, and 75% are college age and older.

Brunswick, home to about 20,000, includes many great restaurants, coffee shops, gelato (a Festival favorite), and stores within a short walk of campus. Residence life trips take students to Freeport, a popular shopping destination, and many students enjoy trips to Portland, which was Bon Appétit’s 2018 Restaurant City of the Year.

Day at a Glance

Daily schedules at the Festival vary greatly depending on a student’s focus and interests. The Festival provides freedom for students to plan their own schedules, individual practice, and group rehearsal time. Students do not have pre-determined agendas for performances or day-to-day activities. Instead, students are surrounded by world-class faculty, inspiring peers, terrific facilities, and hundreds of opportunities to learn, rehearse, and perform. Students take these resources and create a schedule that reflects their personal goals for the summer.

Below is just a sample of what a weekday at the Festival might look like. This is not a daily schedule (e.g. students will not have daily lessons and coachings).

| --- | --- |
| Time | Activity |
| 8:00 – 8:30 AM | Breakfast |

I made so many meaningful personal connections at the Festival, and that’s what made it truly special to be there for six weeks. It was one of the most enriching and fulfilling summers I’ve spent thus far on all fronts: not only as a musician but also as a person and as an artist. I won’t forget this experience.

—Kevin Ahfat

In 2004, as a 15-year-old student, my teachers at the Festival helped me discover my destiny. I fell madly in love with playing chamber music. Over the next four Festival summers I switched from violin to viola and set my sights on playing in a string quartet. My sponsor, Pat Brown, helped make a life of music possible for me and we continue to stay in touch after all these years. Performing and teaching at the Festival with the Dover Quartet has been a dream come true.

—Milena Pajaro-van de Stadt

The summer I spent with the Festival was one of the most special summers I've ever had. I felt grateful that I was able to spend time with beautiful music in every moment in Maine's beautiful environment. Pei-Shan Lee’s coaching was very helpful, and her performance was amazing and inspiring. Here, I learned not only the art of piano playing but also the art of collaboration. I felt so lucky to study with world-renowned and world-class musicians as a collaborative pianist.

—Chewon Park

I felt imbedded in the fabric of the Festival, which brought the support and encouragement to compose at an elevated level. The Festival created a community, a family for me, and a lifeline to have my work performed in the company of the brightest musical talents of our age.

—Michael-Thomas Foumai

The Festival helped me develop as an artist and performer by placing me in an environment in which I was challenged and inspired by my colleagues, all of whom had an equal investment in coming together and creating great music. In addition to having great colleagues who will continue to be involved in my musical life, the program provided me with ample opportunities to play for, and work alongside with, the world renowned musicians who are on faculty.
