A: The 2025 priority deadline is January 20 at 11:59 PM PT. We accept applications after this deadline for select programs, however, the application fee increases.

**Q: When is the letter of recommendation due? How does my teacher submit it?**  
A: Upon submission of your application, your teacher will receive an email with instructions for submitting a letter of recommendation. Please encourage them to submit the letter within one week of your application submission. If your recommender has trouble locating the SlideRoom email, they should email the recommendation letter to Grace Bell at [grace@bowdoinfestival.org,](mailto:grace@bowdoinfestival.org) who can upload it to your application.

**Q: Can the application fee be waived?**  
A: The Festival does not want the application fee to be a barrier to submitting an application. If you would like to request an application fee discount, please email Grace Bell at [grace@bowdoinfestival.org](mailto:grace@bowdoinfestival.org).

**Q: Can I have feedback on my audition videos?**  
A: Due to the large number of applications we receive, we are unable to provide feedback.

A: Yes. If you are admitted for both sessions, you may accept both, or accept one and decline the other.

A: There is no order to our waitlist. If a spot opens, the faculty reconsider each applicant on the waitlist. If you are accepted, you will hear from the Festival immediately.

**Q: I will arrive after registration. What should I do?**  
A: If you have been given permission to arrive after 6:00 PM on Saturday, please go to Osher Hall (#77 on the map) to pick up your registration packet and room key. If you have not done so already, please email Grace ([grace@bowdoinfestival.org](mailto:grace@bowdoinfestival.org)) if you need to arrive late. When you arrive at your residence, please have an RA (resident assistant) check you into your room and sign your room condition form. The RAs can also help you find any information you missed.

**Q: Do I need to transport my harp to the Festival?**  
A: Although we encourage harpists to bring their own instruments, distance often prohibits this. The Festival works with a harp rental company based in Boston, MA.

The student is still responsible for the rental and cartage fees.

A: Although late arrivals and early dismissals are strongly discouraged, we are at times able to accommodate for extenuating circumstances. However, please be aware that some aspects of the program, such as chamber music, may be unavailable to certain participants arriving late or leaving early. All late arrivals, early departures, or other absences must be approved by Festival Directors prior to your arrival.

**Q: Do international participants need to make special travel arrangements?**

**Q: How do I find out my chamber music assignment(s)?**  
A: Chamber music auditions will occur virtually over Zoom in advance of the Festival, starting in late May. Be prepared to play 2–5 minutes of a solo piece of your choice. Students will receive their assignments about two weeks before the beginning of their session and should arrive ready to start rehearsing with their groups immediately. Chamber music coaching schedules for each three-week session are as follows: Tuesday and Friday the first week; Monday and Thursday the second week, and Monday and Wednesday the third week.

To perform in a Young Artists Concert, each chamber group or solo performer must submit an application signed by the private instructor or coach. Fellows and advanced participants are often selected to perform in our [Subscription Series](https://www.bowdoinfestival.org/events/category/subscription-concert-series/) and [Gamper Festival of Contemporary Music](https://www.bowdoinfestival.org/events/category/gamper-festival-of-contemporary-music/).

Groups that have more than four players may sign up for additional practice space through the office in Osher Hall.
