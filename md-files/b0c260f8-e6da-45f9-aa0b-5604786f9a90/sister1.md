## Do I have to worry about transportation during the day?

Activities that take place off-campus during Summer Academy will include transportation in an OSU vehicle, driven by trained Camp Counselors. Campers will need to arrange for their own transportation to and from campus each day. Overnight campers can, upon request, receive transportation assistance to and from the Redmond Municipal Airport.

## How are campers being supervised during summer academy?

During academic tracks, Camp Instructors and Camp Counselors will supervise Campers. During recreation activities, excursions around Bend, and on-campus extra-curricular activities, Camp Counselors or representatives of vendor companies will be with Campers. Overnight Campers in the Residence Hall will be supervised by OSU-Cascades Resident Assistants, Camp Counselors, and the Camp Director.

## What do campers do after dinner for the overnight program?

Camp Counselors will provide evening activities, ranging from movie nights, to board games, to low-ropes team building activities. Campers will also work together on projects and meet for reflection activities.

## What do you suggest my camper brings for the overnight program?

For the overnight program, Campers will enjoy a room furnished with extra-long twin beds, dresser, desk and chair. A pillow and basic set of sheets and towels are included, as well as access to free guest WiFi and cable television in the main lounges. We recommend packing:

1. Toiletries (soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.)
2. Weather-appropriate clothes for the week
3. Any additionally desired bed linens, pillows or towels, etc.
4. Laptop, tablet, books, games and items for entertainment in rooms after the day’s activities unwind.
5. Identification, insurance cards, emergency contacts
6. Spending money if they want to purchase additional snacks or BendBeav gear. Spending money IS NOT REQUIRED.

## What can we do if getting to campus is too difficult?

For guests arriving from 3+ hours away, out-of-state, and internationally, we may be able to work with you on options ranging from overnight accommodations for parent/guardian/families, to airport shuttle runs. We don't want you to miss out on this opportunity, so let us know if this is something that we can accommodate!

## What if my camper has dietary restrictions? Will they be accommodated?

The Summer Academy registration portal provides a section where Campers can share dietary or other restrictions. OSU-Cascades dining staff are experienced in accommodating Campers' dietary needs.

## What do I need to know for check-in?

Day Program – Check-in will take place in Obsidian Hall between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on the first day (Sunday) of your program. Campers will receive a dining card and ID badge. Please bring the Camper's valid state ID, or if that is not available, please be sure that a parent/guardian accompanies the Camper at check-in.

## What happens at the end of the event?

At the concluding event, Campers will share reflections on the week, submit or present final projects, and take a quick assessment of their Summer Academy experience to help us to continue to improve the program.

## Summer can mean smokey skies. How do you manage outside events?

The health and safety of participating youth and camp staff is OSU-Cascades’ top priority. Our staff follow OSU's rules and [guidance](https://ehs.oregonstate.edu/sites/ehs.oregonstate.edu/files/pdf/wildfire_aqi_decision_matrix_final.pdf) for outdoor camps/events during wildfire smoke episodes:  
  
*101-150 AQI*: At higher end of range, consider moving activities indoors.   
*151-200 AQI*: Consider cancellation of more intense outdoor events or move events indoors.   
*201-300 AQI*: Cancel outdoor events involving activity (e.g., sports).  Consider cancelation of outdoor events that do not involve activity (e.g., concerts).   
*301-500 AQI*: Cancel all outdoor events and camp activities. Consider cancelation of indoor camps that require participants or families to travel to and from campus.

During Summer Academy, staff review smoke forecasts and AQI conditions daily to plan for any activity adjustments. Most activities are held indoors and unlikely to be affected by smoke. Should outdoor activities be affected, staff will consider options such as relocating the activity, changing to an indoor activity on- or off-campus, or remaining outdoors and limiting strenuous exercise.
