## FAQs Related to Applications and Admissions

**How many students are in the program? Is admission competitive?**

UVA Advance is an intentionally small program, especially compared to those at other large universities. We strive for a cohort of no more than 60-65 students each year. This contributes to a program in which every student is personally known by peers and staff and allows us to cater informal activities to student interests.

The number of applications received each year varies. Acceptance rates in recent years have ranged between 25% and 50%.

Is it okay for parents, siblings, or tutors to help with the application?

There are portions of the application, such as questions pertaining to residency status, that students may need parental assistance to complete. **All written portions of the application, including any essays or short answer questions, are expected to be solely the work of the applicant.**

What is the attendance policy during the program?

Students are expected to attend all class meetings for the entirety of the program. In the event that a student is unwell and needs to miss a class, permission must be obtained from both the Program Director and the course instructor. Instructors are not obligated to excuse absences.

I'm really interested in one specific course in the Course Catalog. Can I apply directly for admission into a specific class?

All admissions are for the UVA Advance program, not for any specific class being offered in a given summer. Admitted students will be issued a survey to rank their course preferences. Students will be enrolled in one Core and one Elective class based on their preferences, available space, and determinations regarding best fit. Every effort is made to place students in one of their top two choices for each class. Students and families should understand that accepting or declining an admissions offer precedes course selection and that placement in a course other than the student's first choice is not sufficient grounds for withdrawal.

**Can credits be transferred? How can students get transcripts when the program ends?**

Credits typically transfer to other institutions of higher education, though we cannot make that guarantee. Other universities often request the course syllabus, so it’s a good idea to save those!

Both official and unofficial transcripts can be requested from the [Registrar’s office.](https://registrar.virginia.edu/transcript)

**I want to apply to UVA for undergrad. How can I make sure admissions knows about my participation in UVA Advance?**

Make sure to include the transcript of your classes when applying to undergraduate admission at UVA (they will not automatically show up on your application). Additionally, there are often options within the application where you can add additional information about your connection to the University.

## FAQs Related to Student Life

**How are roommates chosen? Can I choose to room with someone I already know in the program?**

While roommates are assigned randomly, we will do our best to take into consideration some preferences regarding daily habits. Students will be sent a questionnaire prior to the program start. Please note that students may not request a specific roommate and we deliberately try to place students with a roommate from a different school district than their own.

**Do students have free movement around the University?**

Yes, students have free range of University Grounds between the hours of 6am and 10pm.

**Are students allowed to leave Grounds during the weekend to do something fun with friends? What if parents want to take them out to dinner? Can they go home overnight?**

Yes! Students can arrange to go into town with friends as long as they have permission from the program director and keep RCAs informed of their plans.

We encourage students not to go home overnight during the program and require written parental requests in advance for overnight absences.

Do program participants have access to medical services while at UVA?

Yes, program participants have access to student medical services, including Student Health and Wellness, counseling services, and disability access services.

In the event that a participant needs medical care outside of normal business hours, program staff will assist the student in obtaining care from the UVA medical center.

Does the program or University provide transportation between the airport and Grounds?

There is no transportation provided between the Charlottesville airport and the University. Students flying into Charlottesville will need to procure a taxi or ride service to bring them to Grounds.

## FAQs Related to Finances

**Is dining included in the program cost? How do I get a dining plan?**

Dining is included in the program cost. Dining plans are connected to student ID cards issued when students arrive on-Grounds. If students run low on dining “swipes” program staff will add more.

**How much can students expect to spend on incidentals not included in the program cost?**

Students and families are responsible for the following additional costs associated with the program:

* Travel to and from Charlottesville
* [Textbooks and school supplies](https://www.uvabookstores.com/textbook-course-materials) (many professors upload digital materials rather than assigning physical texts; check with course instructors about what is necessary to purchase)
* Laundry (RCAs will show you how to link a debit card to the laundry app in the dorm)
* Spending money
* Spending money varies by student. Consider how often you might want to order takeout or go to the movies on the weekend to get a sense of how much spending money you will want.

**Can parents pay for this program using funds from a 529 Plan?**

Specific regulations for using 529 Plan funds vary by plan, so parents should begin by reaching out to their specific plan administrator. More information regarding 529 Plans and UVA payments can be found on the [Student Financial Services webpage](https://sfs.virginia.edu/tuition-billing/billing-payment/view-and-pay-your-bill/529-college-savings-state-prepaid-tuition).

**How do I apply for financial aid and how are financial aid decisions made?**

We offer a small number of need-based financial aid packages each year. Interested students need to upload the [financial aid application](https://summer.virginia.edu/uva-advance-program-details) materials into the application portal (this is actually attached after submitting the admissions materials). All financial aid materials must be uploaded by March 1.

Our admissions team reviews applications and makes admissions decisions independent of financial need; we then send any financial aid applications from our admitted students to Student Financial Services. SFS reviews the financial aid applications and sends us their determinations about student need. We then meet the financial needs of as many students as possible, beginning with those SFS has identified as highest financial need. Some years we are able to meet the needs of all applicants and other years we are not. Either way, students know their financial aid status prior to the deadline to accept or decline an offer of admission (if applicable). Our maximum aid package covers the full cost of tuition and fees for Virginia residents ($7,097 for 2026).

How do I add my financial aid application to my admissions materials?
