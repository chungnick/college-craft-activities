# Tuition & Fees

All students who undertake any form of in-person academic study within the University are required to pay the **[comprehensive fee](https://uvafinance.virginia.edu/sites/uvafinance/files/Components%20of%20Mandatory%20Fee%202025-26.pdf)** in addition to tuition. Payment of the comprehensive fee is due in full on **May 20, 2026**, or five days after course enrollment, whichever is later. The comprehensive fee will not be refunded once Summer Session classes begin, regardless of which session students are enrolled in, because it enables students to utilize University resources regardless of their class session. Tuition for each session is due by the third day classes meet.

Students who only take a class or classes offered online or in a location other than UVA in Charlottesville will not pay the comprehensive fee. They will pay the Off-Grounds Fee for Special Academic Programs, which is $12 per credit.

Total charges will include any past-due amounts (regular semester tuition, parking tickets, library fines, etc.) as well as all Summer Session tuition and the comprehensive fee.

**[Summer Session Financial Aid](https://sfs.virginia.edu/financial-aid-current-students/current-undergraduate-students/summer-session-financial-aid)** information is available through Student Financial Services.

              Email: [veteransbenefits@virginia.edu](mailto:veteransbenefits@virginia.edu)

              Phone: 434-982-5300

**Please note:** Military educational benefits will impact certain financial aid eligibility. They will be included as a financial resource in your financial aid offer and may reduce Virginia state grants, University grants, and private loans. Each financial aid offer type is different, so the military education benefit may affect each person’s offer differently. Before using benefits, please contact Student Financial Services for questions about how your military education benefits may impact your financial aid at [sfs@virginia.edu](mailto:sfs@virginia.edu) or (434) 982-5300.

\**Veteran and Active Duty students should work with the [Office of Virginia Status](https://vastatus.virginia.edu/) first to determine eligibility for in-state status. Dependents may work with the Military Educational Benefits team for in-status via the [Choice Act](https://registrar.virginia.edu/military-affiliated-students/choice-act).*
