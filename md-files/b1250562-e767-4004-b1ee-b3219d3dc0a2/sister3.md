## Application & Visa Information

### Summer College and College Prep

### English Proficiency

If you are a student applying to take credit courses, and English is not the primary language of instruction at your high school, please submit English proficiency examination scores from one of the following exams, along with the rest of your application materials, to [**highschool@georgetown.edu**](mailto:highschool@georgetown.edu)**.**

* TOEFL scores: We require a minimum score of 550 (paper-based), 225 (computer-based), or 90 (iBT)
* IELTS scores: We require a minimum score of 7.0
* Duolingo: We require a minimum score of 115

Please note that TOEFL scores expire after two years, and we require valid, unexpired score reports.

If you attend a bilingual school, your school official must email a copy of your school profile to [**highschool@georgetown.edu**](mailto:highschool@georgetown.edu) in lieu of proficiency examination scores.

### **Visa Information**

Georgetown provides F-1 visa support only for full time enrollment (six credits in person). Students who request F-1 support on their application will receive an F-1 portal email invitation from the Office of Global Services (OGS) within one week after enrolling. F-1 students must obtain their Form I-20 from OGS before they can apply for the F-1 visa from the U.S. embassy.

Summer College and College Prep students should request their I-20 from OGS by May 1, but earlier action is strongly encouraged. F-1 visa advising for full time students is provided by email via [newinternational@georgetown.edu](mailto:newinternational@georgetown.edu).

### Academies

### **English Proficiency**

TOEFL scores are not required for the Academies. To fully participate and enjoy these programs, we recommend that you be able to:

* In English, understand the main ideas of complex texts on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in your field(s) of interest.
* Interact with a degree of English fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers possible without strain for either party.
* Produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue, giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.

### **Visa Information**

Georgetown will not provide visa assistance for any student enrolled in a non-credit Academy course.

## Contact Information

### **Still Have Questions?**

If you have additional questions, please contact us at [**highschool@georgetown.edu**](mailto:highschool@georgetown.edu)**,** and we'll be happy to assist you.
