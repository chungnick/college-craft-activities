The Summer High School Internship Program at MIT Lincoln Laboratory provides a unique opportunity for rising seniors who **live and attend high school in the New England area** to experience and explore STEM careers before committing to an area of study in college.  During the summer, local high school interns are paired with Laboratory staff mentors to complete projects, solve problems, and learn and apply crucial technical and interpersonal skills in a hands-on, professional environment.  Local high school interns will also have access to many of the Laboratory’s technical and professional resources.  This opportunity is a paid learning experience.
