The Interdisciplinary Science & Research (ISR) Program is a partnership between the Vanderbilt Collaborative STEM Education and Outreach and Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools to enhance students’ understandings of STEM concepts and research principles and to empower teachers through scientific research. ISR course offerings are available to students at Stratford STEM Magnet High School, Hillsboro High School and John Overton High School. All courses are co-taught by a scientist-teacher team focused on individualized instruction to meet student needs. The program transitions students from understanding the basics of scientific disciplines in the first year to performing independent research in their junior and senior years. The Interdisciplinary Science & Research Program is elevating the learning and teaching of science, preparing students to solve 21st century problems.

While not academically selective, ISR does require a great deal of motivation from the student to commit to the rigorous 4-year program, and students are always expected to fully participate in all coursework. We welcome students who love science and math and are willing to work diligently to complete assignments. At every level, ISR will require some work outside of class, but teachers and scientists are available to help you. Students are expected to be active, collaborative learners who will engage in the process of science: formulating questions, developing and testing hypotheses, and presenting results. Additionally, classroom attendance is incredibly important, as it can be difficult to recreate laboratory activities outside of class.

## ISR Highlights

ISR students have the opportunity to present their research at local and national scientific conferences.

ISR students have numerous opportunities for field trips and job shadows!

ISR students present their work at a yearly symposium.

A trip to a local recording study highlighted a unit on the science of music!
