Since 1958, talented rising seniors and highly motivated rising juniors from high schools around New Hampshire have come together for the Advanced Studies Program at St. Paul’s School. The five-week-long ASP is more than summer school — it’s a unique, immersive and transformative program that is equal parts academic exploration, college preparation … and fun.

The ASP is about diving deep into thought-provoking classes in which you encounter real-world problems and relevant ideas. It is about developing friendships with like-minded peers from across the state, being exposed to new activities and new career paths. It is about getting a jump start that will leave you feeling confident about the college application process.

Today’s everchanging world needs big thinkers and active citizens. What inspires you? Whether it is engineering, law and governance, studio arts, molecular biology or data science, the ASP offers you a unique opportunity to learn and grow. It will be a summer to remember, a summer that just might change your life.

The 2026 session will run from Sunday, June 21, to Sunday, July 26.

Feel free to contact [Michelle Taffe ASP ‘85](mailto:mtaffe@sps.edu), director of the Advanced Studies Program, if you have any questions.
