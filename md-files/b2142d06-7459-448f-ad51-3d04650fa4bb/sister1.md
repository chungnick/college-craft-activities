No one should be deterred by financial limitations from applying for admission to the ASP. Over the past five years, 40-50% of the student body has received financial aid.

Tuition for the 2026 session will remain at $4,950. Tuition includes instruction, book and course fees, housing, and meals. Every year we do our best to meet the demonstrated need for those who qualify through our need-based financial aid system and are able to offer very generous packages.

**The deadline to apply for financial aid is Jan. 23**.

Financial aid decisions will be sent with letters of admission in mid-March.

## Applying for Financial Aid

The ASP financial aid program is designed to make an ASP education possible for all families based on demonstrated financial need and the availability of funds. The ASP is proud to use the Clarity Application to determine a family’s level of financial need based on the information that families share in the application which includes assets, income, expenses and debts.

To get started, please go to the [Clarity Application](https://app.clarityapp.com/sign-up) and create an account. The application typically takes less than 30 minutes to complete. The Clarity Application is also mobile-friendly so you can complete it from anywhere. You are also able to save your progress and return at any time. **When asked to select a school to apply to, be sure to select “ASP Summer at St. Paul’s School (Concord, NH).”** At the end of the application, there is a $65 fee to submit. The system automatically qualifies families for fee waivers based on meeting certain income and asset-based criteria. Clarity uses the income and asset information in the financial aid application itself to assess the family situation and automatically applies a waiver if the family qualifies. Qualifying families will simply bypass the payment screen when their application is complete. If you do not qualify for an automatic fee waiver, you will need to [contact the Advanced Studies Program](mailto:asp@sps.edu) directly and request a waiver.

**The deadline for completing the financial aid application, including relevant supplemental documents, is Jan. 23.**

If you need support during the process of completing your application, there is an in-app support available through the “Help” button in the bottom left of the screen, as well as email and phone support at [support@clarityapp.com](mailto:support@clarityapp.com) or 206-210-3752, in both English and Spanish. The application itself is also fully translated into Spanish.

**Please note:** You must choose **“ASP Summer at St. Paul’s School (Concord, NH)”** when completing your Clarity Application. If you select the wrong program or school, we will not see your application and will not be able to consider your family for financial aid.
