Thank you for your interest in the St. Paul’s School Advanced Studies Program!

The ASP is open to current sophomores and juniors attending public or parochial schools in New Hampshire. Most students apply in the fall of their junior year for attendance in the summer before their senior year of high school. We also welcome applications from academically strong sophomores who, if accepted, will attend during the summer before their junior year of high school. Application materials and deadlines can be found on this page. There is no fee to apply to the ASP.

Before completing the formal application process, please read the [ASP Viewbook](https://issuu.com/stpaulsschool/docs/advanced_studies_program_viewbook?fr=sOWI4Njg4NTM5NjE) carefully and consult with your principal or guidance counselor.

The 2026 session runs from June 21 to July 26, 2026. Every year, we work to make the ASP experience affordable to as many qualified students as possible; more than 50% of  attendees receive financial aid equal on average to two-thirds the cost of the program. Tuition for the 2026 session, inclusive of room and board and all fees, is $4,950.

## The Application Process

Please be aware that applying to the ASP summer program is separate and utilizes a different platform from the application for the academic-year program at St. Paul’s School. Admission and financial aid decisions for each year’s summer session are typically sent in mid-March.

#### 1. Create Your Online Account

All application materials will be submitted through our online portal that uses the Ravenna platform. **Please note the ASP is only open to current sophomores and juniors who attend public or parochial school in New Hampshire.**

#### 2. Complete the Student Application and Parent Statement by January 6.

#### 3. Complete all the following forms by January 23:

* Teacher Recommendation Form

#### 4. Submit Transcript Report by January 23

A full high school transcript including first quarter or first trimester grades for the current year must also be submitted by the administrator or school counselor completing the school counselor recommendation form.
