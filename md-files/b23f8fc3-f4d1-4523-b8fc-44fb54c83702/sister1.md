## Dates and Deadlines

The Mathcamp application deadline for this summer will be Feb. 23, 2026. All components of the application must be received by that date, including the Qualifying Quiz. Candidates who wish to be considered for financial aid should also submit the completed financial aid application by that date.

The full calendar for the admissions season is as follows:

| Event | Date |
| --- | --- |
| Application Opens for 2026 | January 12 |
| Deadline for Application for Admission | February 23 |
| Deadline for Financial Aid Application | February 23 |
| Admissions and Financial Aid Decisions Announced | April 17 |
| Deadline for Admitted Students to Register | TBA |

All materials must be submitted by 11:59 pm Eastern Time (UTC -5) on the date of the deadline. Be sure to allow sufficient time for your application to be complete by the deadline.

(There is no longer an apply-by-mail option; everything is submitted electronically. Pro tip: you'll find that upload speeds on our website are zippier when it's not five minutes before the deadline.)

### Waitlisted Applicants

On decision day, we will place a small number of applicants on the waitlist. As places become available, we will admit waitlisted applicants throughout May.

### Late Applications

We do not accept late applications.
