## How much does Mathcamp cost?

The base cost for Mathcamp 2026 will be $7,500 USD. After financial aid, the final camp fee will be **between $0 and $7,500**, determined on a case-by-case basis depending on individual family circumstances. This camp fee includes tuition, room, board, all extracurricular activities, and local transportation to and from Burlington International Airport (BTV).

There is no application fee.

## Financial Aid

We award **over $100,000 per year in scholarships**, based on need.
Mathcamp is **free** for US and Canadian families with household incomes under $100,000 (with typical assets), and need-based financial aid is widely available for middle-income families as well as international students, including full scholarships and travel grants. [Learn more about Financial Aid](/admission/scholarships).

## Registration and Withdrawal

At the time of registration, we ask for a deposit of 25% of the expected camp fee (taking scholarships into account). The remaining 75% will be due on or before the first day of camp.

See [the fine print](/admission/policies) for details on the withdrawal policy.
