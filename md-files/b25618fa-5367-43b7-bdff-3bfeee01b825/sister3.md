  ### Selecting Kickoff Event

  Lead Coach 1 or 2 may enter or edit their Kickoff information during the kickoff selection dates ([September 25, 2025 Noon E](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/calendar?view=calendar&hsLang=en#kit-kickoff-registration-opens)T - [November 18, 2025 Noon ET](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/calendar?view=calendar&hsLang=en#kit-kickoff-registration-closes)) by following these steps (or view our [step-by-step Kickoff Instructions](https://www.firstinspires.org/hubfs/web/program/frc/reg/kickoff-instructions.pdf?hsLang=en) with screenshots):

  1. Log in to your *FIRST*® account at [www.firstinspires.org](//www.firstinspires.org?hsLang=en)
  2. Click the blue “Event Options” button located under the “Team Events” column
  3. Select the “Kit & Kickoff” link
  4. Enter your Kit and Kickoff information
  5. Click the blue “Submit” button

  Teams can also find a Kickoff event near them by checking out the [Event Search Page](/team-event-search?hsLang=en). Only teams that have selected a kickoff location to pick up the kit and have secured their registration fee by the [payment due date](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/calendar?view=calendar&hsLang=en#initial-payment-due) will receive their Kickoff Kit at the kickoff. Teams that have not secured their registration fee by the [payment due date](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/calendar?view=calendar&hsLang=en#initial-payment-due) will be considered a MySite.

* Kickoff Kit Pick Up

  ### Kickoff Kit Pick Up

  If a team is unable to pick-up their Kickoff Kit at the local kickoff selected, a surrogate may be designated to do so. Additionally, teams may opt to instead be a "MySite" team for an additional charge. Please see the information below for additional details.

  Who is allowed to pick up a kickoff kit:

  + Lead Coach 1 or 2 for the team with photo ID
  + Any mentor on the team over 18 (you may log in to your [*FIRST* Dashboard](http://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) as proof) with photo ID
  + The person over 18 that is listed on the [Surrogate Kit Pick-up Letter](https://secure.na1.adobesign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhCxy-I0VxHV1V1FBARIe10yjfYY8l1cpQesH7_At2-Kf0yRnEzNhJl9hQfJFJFh6f8*) with photo ID
* MySites

  ### MySites

  If a team is not attending a local Kickoff, they have the option to be a “MySite” team and have their Kickoff Kit shipped, after Kickoff, to an address of their choice. As a reminder, MySites ship after Kickoff and the team must be secured in order for items to ship.

  The shipping fee is a flat ground or air rate (depending on the team’s location). Teams within the continental US & Canada receive kits via Ground Shipping whereas Hawaii, Alaska, Mexico, and all other international countries receive items via Air Shipping. The table below shows how the costs differ based on what aspects of the kit the team opts out of. Veteran teams are able to opt out of the Black Tote and Drive Base Kit but must do so by [the deadline](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/calendar?view=calendar&hsLang=en#kit-opt-out-closes).

  **All Shipping Fees are Final:**  
  Once you have chosen your shipping option and completed payment, the transaction is final and non-refundable. This applies even if you later change your kickoff pickup location.

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Kit of Parts Items to be Shipped | **2026 Ground Cost** | **2026 Air Cost** |
  | Season Specific | $50.00 | $150.00 |
  | Season Specific + Black Tote | $135.00 | $520.00 |
  | Season Specific + Drive Base | $105.00 | $505.00 |
  | Season Specific + Black Tote + Drive Base (i.e. a “full” veteran kit) | $190.00 | $545.00 |
  | Season Specific + Black Tote + Drive Base + Gray Tote (i.e. a “full” rookie kit) | $315.00 | $770.00 |
* Surrogate Kit Pick-Up

  ### Surrogate Kit Pick-Up

  If a team is unable to pick up its Kickoff Kit at the local kickoff selected, an alternate team may be designated to do so. The team unable to attend must be registered to pick up their Kickoff Kit at the local kickoff AND provide *FIRST* with an authorized [surrogate kit pick-up letter](http://secure.na1.adobesign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhCxy-I0VxHV1V1FBARIe10yjfYY8l1cpQesH7_At2-Kf0yRnEzNhJl9hQfJFJFh6f8*), submitted/signed by the Lead Coach 1 or 2 or team administrator: 1) Your team number 2) the Kickoff location 3) the name and team number (if applicable) of the surrogate picking up the Kickoff Kit. All surrogate kit pickup letters must be received at *FIRST* by **January 8, 2026**.
