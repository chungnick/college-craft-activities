The University of Notre Dame’s Harper Cancer Research Institute is providing educational research opportunities for the next generation of cancer researchers and better serve the greater good within the global community.

The Harper Cancer Research Institute at the University of Notre Dame is dedicated to advancing education and research in the field of cancer. This marketable, applied learning opportunity offers hands-on lab experience and individualized mentoring, enhancing problem-solving and leadership skills.
