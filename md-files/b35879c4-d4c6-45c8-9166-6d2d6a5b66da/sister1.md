The Hahn-Pflueger Brain Cancer Scholars Program provides current juniors at the University of Notre Dame with a distinctive, immersive summer experience in brain cancer research spanning both clinical and laboratory settings. Throughout the program, scholars gain exposure to foundational laboratory techniques used in biomedical research, participate in hands-on investigative work, and observe the medical and surgical care of patients with brain cancer. Each student completes a substantive, mentored research project that reflects the translational nature of modern cancer research.

The program is designed for current juniors (**rising seniors; all other applicants will not be considered**) who intend to pursue medical school or research-focused graduate training in the health sciences. Working closely with accomplished physician-scientists and researchers, scholars engage in meaningful laboratory and/or clinical research focused on brain cancer, building a strong understanding of how scientific discovery informs patient care. This experience deepens preparation for medical and research careers by integrating scientific inquiry, clinical observation, and professional mentorship within leading brain cancer research environments.

**Application Timeline**

The NCI has recently released three RFPs of interest. For full application instructions, please see the links below. A summary of the research supported on these mechanisms, excerpted from the NCI program announcement, follows.

An increasing number of studies demonstrate that even when socioeconomic and access to care factors are accounted for, incidence and mortality gaps persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types, which suggests a role for biological contributors. Such studies have included identification of ancestry-related differences in DNA, RNA, and/or protein expression that are associated with cancer risk and/or progression. Other studies have shown the presence of differential tumor microenvironment components among diverse racial/ethnic populations indicating a potential role for immunity and inflammation in contributing to cancer health disparities.

These complex biological factors may enhance understanding of the differences observed in cancer incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates among underrepresented populations. The NCI encourages investigations of such biological factors to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that play a role in cancer health disparities.

***Research topics of interest include but are not limited to*****:**

* Causal drivers of early onset of certain cancer types in specific populations
* Genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of cancer susceptibility differences among racial/ethnic populations, such as epigenetic drivers and or suppressors
* Understanding how race/ethnicity impacts disease penetrance in individuals who inherit a cancer susceptibility gene
* Understanding if race/ethnicity has a role in regression of precancerous lesions
* Understanding if risk factors, including environmental exposures, differ across race/ethnicity to influence the development of precancerous lesions
* Identifying cancer risk and early detection biomarkers among underrepresented populations
* Examination of how stress impacts the progression of symptoms across different population groups
* Identify underlying mechanisms of symptoms that are responsible for altering treatment regimens that increase the risk of mortality for racial/ethnic minority patients with cancer
* Understand the process through which precision therapies improve symptom management to reduce health disparities
* Similarities and differences in cancer metabolism (e.g. alterations in metabolic fuel sources, fatty acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, nutrient uptake) among racial/ethnic populations
* New 3D cellular models, organoids, xenografts, patient-derived models, and microfluidic systems designed to recapitulate and investigate cancer health disparities
* Epithelial and mesenchymal markers in circulating tumor cells in cancer patients of distinct racial/ethnic groups
* Investigations of how social health disparities may cause adverse gene expression that confers increased cancer risk and/or aggressiveness
* Role of the microbiota in cancer health disparities during tumorigenesis and cancer progression
* Role of the oncogenic pathogens in the development of cancer health disparities during tumorigenesis and cancer progression in different populations groups
* Computational analysis and modeling for predicting aggressive tumors in distinct racial/ethnic populations
* Understanding the biologic mechanisms behind the differences in toxicity and symptoms in different population groups
* Understanding of biological mechanisms of how stress impacts the progression of symptoms in racial/ethnic minority groups
* Deciphering the mechanisms of accumulated exposure to environmental toxins across populations
* Understanding the biological processes through which precision interventions improve symptom management to reduce cancer health disparities
* Biological bases of differences among racial/ethnic populations in responses to cancer immunotherapies and/or development of immune-related adverse events induced by cancer immunotherapies.

### **PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT**

Across the sciences, the skills required to analyze large data sets, build statistical models, and simulate complex processes are becoming increasingly critical. For example, genomic data sets may consist of millions of sequencing reads from hundreds or thousands of samples. In ecology and earth sciences, researchers are applying new methods for modeling ecological data and assimilating data and models to improve forecasts of ecological and environmental change. In systems biology, scientists are modeling the emergent properties of interacting genes, proteins, cells, and tissues. *All of these research areas depend on computational fluency.*

**The REACT program (Rapid Exposure to Advanced Computational Training) is a short-term initiative to support graduate students to receive the latest training in computational tools and techniques in their field.** REACT is a joint effort between the [Environmental Change Initiative (ECI)](https://environmentalchange.nd.edu/about/affiliated-faculty/), the [Eck Institute for Global Health (EIGH)](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/faculty/?service=undefined&location=undefined&name=&title=&school=undefined&id=&dept=&area=), the [Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility (GBCF)](https://genomics.nd.edu/about/people/), the [Center for Research Computing (CRC)](https://crc.nd.edu/) and the [Harper Cancer Institute (HCRI)](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/people/). REACT will provide up to $1,300 to cover student tuition, registration, and board required to attend nationally-recognized workshops that provide the latest training in computational approaches.

### **Eligibility**

* The applicant must be a PhD student or thesis Masters student enrolled at Notre Dame.
* The student's advisor/PI must be a member in good standing with either the Environmental Change Initiative, the Eck Institute for Global Health, Notre Dame’s Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, the Center for Research Computing, or the Harper Cancer Institute. Students should check with their advisors if they are not sure of their PI’s affiliations.
* Students attending workshops may be asked to share the knowledge they gain with local working groups, journal clubs, classes, or a symposium of fellow REACT awardees.
* REACT will cover costs for registration and tuition up to $1,300. REACT **does not** currently cover research expenses.

### **Application instructions**
