#### Education and Training Resources

# High School

# Junior Speed Mentoring

One of the goals of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to train the next generation of exceptional cancer-researchers. For us, it is never too early to ignite an interest in science and medicine.

Elementary, middle, and high school teachers (4th to 12th grade) may sign their class up for our MCC Jr. Speed Mentoring (free of charge).

Via Zoom, one of our outstanding cancer researchers will virtually join the class and provide an age-appropriate Cancer 101 tutorial, talk briefly about their cutting edge research with the goal of encouraging interest in STEM careers, and take questions from the students.

We will also provide a direct line of communication to your students for future questions and academic/career advice. Longer-term goals will be to provide internships for high school students interested in hands-on scientific experience and training.

We look forward to meeting your students soon!
