The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture offers two full-time, rigorous, online-based summer programs to introduce students to the discipline and practice of architecture and one in-person program to introduce advanced and interdisciplinary students to digital fabrication. **Introduction to Architecture: Foundation Studies and Portfolio Development for High School Students** is a five-week program for students entering or currently attending high school who are interested in exploring the fundamentals of design and thinking at the architectural scale. **Introduction to Architecture: Foundation Studies and Portfolio Development for College Students** is a four-week program intended for students at the college level who are considering applying to a professional degree program in architecture at the undergraduate or graduate level. The Introduction to Architecture programs are each full-time, intensive programs modeled on the curriculum that has distinguished the School of Architecture's five-year Bachelor of Architecture professional degree program for over thirty years. The program offers a comprehensive overview of the culture, practice and history of architecture. Students will engage in the iterative process of analysis and design as foundational for a critical approach to the study and making of architecture. Workshops in digital techniques support and extend the program as an online learning platform. Program faculty are graduates of professional degree programs in architecture, with experience in both teaching and practice.
