July 6 - August 7, 2026 | 5-weeks | **Live** **Synchronous Sessions** Monday-Friday, 11AM-2PM EST

Student daily tutorial and desk-critique sessions will be assigned to either 9AM-11AM or 2PM-4PM EST to accommodate time zone differences.

**Application Deadline:** June 1, 2026. **Enrollment Deadline:** June 13, 2026

**Program Description**

*The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture of The Cooper Union is proud to announce our 2026 summer intensive program that features a virtual curriculum accessible to students worldwide. As an institution that is committed to the pursuit of excellence and learning, we view our current circumstances as an opportunity to advance our thinking through radical experimentation between various forms of online engagements, digital interface, virtual modeling and representation techniques. The pleasure of making and experimentation are fundamental to our discovery of architecture and the innovation of the discipline, as well as a deeply thoughtful form of social and cultural dialogue where the imaginary becomes possible.*

This five-week intensive is designed to familiarize students with architectural thinking and design while developing a portfolio of projects. Students who attend the program and successfully complete all of the assignments will receive an official Certificate of Completion from The Cooper Union.

###### The School of Architecture successfully adapted virtual platforms of instruction in the Spring 2020 semester.

The program will include lectures, workshops and tutorials by Cooper faculty including [Mersiha Veledar](https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/mersiha-veledar), [James Lowder](https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/james-lowder), [Nader Tehrani](https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/nader-tehrani), [Elizabeth O'Donnell](https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/elizabeth-odonnell) and [Lauren Kogod](https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/lauren-kogod#/gallery/0)amongst others.In line with our professional curriculum in architecture, the core of the program is the design and critique process. Mornings will consist of workshops, seminars and learning about the history, contexts, and processes forming the architectural discipline. Students will work remotely while engaging virtually with each other and the faculty. Exercises will focus on the key principles of architectural design: geometry, structure and function. The goal of this intensive is for students to learn how to translate their ideas into three-dimensional form and develop a portfolio.

Students will receive instruction in a variety of representational tools and media: digital drawing and model-making techniques, analysis and representation, computer modeling and fabrication. Weekly lectures will introduce some of the great works in the history of architecture.

**Virtual Methods**

Through an iterative design process, students will discover the importance of developing digital proficiency through various methods of representation and geometric composition, while testing new forms of knowledge. The focus will be on how representation, the systems of abstraction that conflate problems of depiction, instrumentality, and imagination, develop the analytical tools necessary to describe and interrogate objects in the world and the creative intellect. Thus, we will explore how the representation of space operates as a mechanism that recreates the world.

Summer 2019 portfolio sample by Jacob Albanese.

These working methods will alternate between two dimensions and three dimensions and highlight multiple processes to guide the design and construction of a physical space. In addition to the rigorous engagement with drawing  and scripting, virtual modeling and imaging introduce complex geometric properties and phenomenological qualities, such as light and atmosphere, for students to develop an intuitive understanding of materiality and scale. Critical knowledge and deployment of these parameters will be tested back and forth between hybrid techniques in Rhino [3-D modeling], Photoshop [materials and atmospheres], and 3-D printing [physical models] as key processes in the development of individual portfolios.

Summer 2019 portfolio sample by Chandler Vogel.

**Context**

In addition to weekly design problems, this program will provide historical context through a sequence of robust seminars, film screenings, and weekly readings that will elucidate different ways to ‘see’ space across various scales and cultures. This dialogue is instrumental in learning to challenge the habitual by providing historical perspectives on the evolution of spatial transformation in architecture. A lecture series with accomplished practitioners will provide insight into the development of their work through various case studies that highlight their innovative design practices. Group sessions offer an invaluable resource for our students to advance through faculty critiques and feedback on their projects while being part of a larger forum of fellow students.

**Outcomes**

Over the course of the program students will develop a set of projects in the form of models and drawings, practice presenting their ideas clearly, and collect their work into a portfolio. The design faculty will work with each student, individually and as a group, to review and edit their projects, resulting in a portfolio that may be used as part of the college application process. This course guides students to gain the following:

* The ability to think precisely through the use of descriptive geometry.
* Advanced skills and facility between hybrid digital tools in the making of architecture.
* Technical proficiency in design software and hardware
* Practice and vocabulary articulating the contextual, formal, and conceptual aspects of their projects.
* A body of work for your college admission portfolio.
* Exposure to a dedicated college faculty mentorship where lectures, tutorials, and critical discourse become key in future creative advancement.
* Intellectual and critical thinking skills through college-level coursework.
* The opportunity to enter the architecture learning community and interact with students from all over the world with diverse creative interests.
* Make professional connections through unprecedented accessibility to an international jury of architecture faculty and critics.
* High School students earn a Certificate of Completion from The Cooper Union.
* Opportunity to be included in a virtual group exhibition of student work after program completion.

**Course Timeline**

Weekly design problems will be structured as spatial games with specific rules to enable students to encounter new ways of seeing, thinking, and making.

* **Week 1**Software Variations: Points and Lines
* **Week 2**     Modelling Plasticity: Object Volumes
* **Week 3**     Hybrid Systems [Weeks 1 and 2 in tandem]

Upon successfully completing the course, students will receive an official Statement of Completion from The Cooper Union.

Successful completion is determined by the instructors and the administration of the School of Architecture and will be based on attendance, satisfactory completion of assignments, participation in group critiques, design work and productivity, and adherence to the program's Code of Conduct.

Class attendance is carefully monitored. Students are expected to attend all classes unless they are ill. A student who misses multiple class sessions may not receive a Certificate of Completion, even if those absences are excused.

**Online Class Participation**

Synchronous learning and class attendance is mandatory. Asynchronous learning is expected. Unexcused absences can lead to dismissal from the program. In the event that a student is dismissed due to unexcused absences, no portion of tuition will be refunded. Students are expected to engage seriously in their studies through class participation, completion of assigned work, and critique. Disruptive behavior in any form will not be tolerated.

**Academic Integrity**

The Cooper Union is committed to preserving an environment that challenges every student to realize their potential. You are expected to provide your best effort and will be supported to produce original work of the highest caliber. Plagiarism is the presentation of another person’s “work” (ideas, words, equations, computer code, graphics, lab data, etc.) as one’s own. Plagiarism in any form is not tolerated and may lead to dismissal from the program.

**Code of Conduct**

The [Code of Conduct](http://cooper.edu/about/policies/code-of-conduct) is designed to ensure the safety and well-being of the students and the integrity of the college. It is strictly enforced and failure to abide by it results in dismissal from the Introduction to Architecture Online for High School Students. A student’s adherence to the Code of Conduct is determined by the instructors and administration of the School of Architecture.

In the event a student is dismissed due to violating the Code of Conduct, he/she/they will not receive a Certificate of Completion and no portion of tuition will be refunded. Students who have been dismissed are not permitted to participate in the remainder of the online program.
