### Explore the World of Computer Science!

CS Scholars takes rising high school sophomores on a four-week deep dive into computer science, combining classroom instruction, hands-on projects, faculty lectures, and industry engagement with leading tech companies around the country. This fully funded, merit-based program gives students the opportunity to explore computing with Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and researchers, gaining mentorship, developing technical skills, and applying their learning to real-world challenges in computer science.

## Program Overview

As a CS Scholar, you will dive into college-level courses and weekly college prep seminars covering admissions, financial aid, and social-emotional wellbeing. Through project-based learning, you’ll explore computing and mathematics while collaborating on hands-on group projects that tackle real-world challenges and culminate in a final symposium presentation. You’ll also connect with industry leaders, gain mentorship from faculty, and build lasting relationships with peers all while experiencing life on a college campus.  A core value of the CS Scholars program is a commitment to an inclusive, equitable community where all participants feel valued and supported; scholars are expected to uphold this value and actively contribute to a culture of respect and belonging.

Students who complete the program and demonstrate a desire to continue may be invited to return as rising seniors to CMU’s AI Scholars program the following summer! 

CS Scholars is a fully funded, merit-based program that brings together students from across the country to learn directly from CMU faculty, staff, and researchers. Thanks to generous support from foundations, corporations, sponsors, and donors, all program costs are covered, including\*:

* Tuition
* Housing
* Meal plans
* Select program-related field trips and special events

*\*Limited travel assistance is available for families facing transportation barriers.*

## Financial Need

CS Scholars (CSS) utilizes a holistic application review and admissions process, looking at the full application and selecting program participants based on a combination of factors. Because participants are fully funded, demonstration of financial need is one of these factors. There is no option for participants to pay out of pocket tuition fees for this program, and documentation of financial need is required for application submission. Documentation includes either tax documents **or** a completed [NACAC Application Fee Waiver](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-feewaiver-fillable.pdf) signed by your high school guidance department. Examples of demonstrated financial need can be found [here](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-feewaiver-fillable.pdf).

Please reach out to the CSS Program Director, [Natalie Hatcher](mailto:nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu), with questions.

**All applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered.**

## Is this program only for students with financial need?

The CS Scholars program is intended to create opportunities for students who lack access and/or resources at home, at school, or in their communities. This can mean financial need, it can mean a lack of computer science education in your school district or community, or lack of access to affordable/stable internet or computing devices. We recognize that students may not meet the current financial need requirements, but may still lack access or opportunity for other reasons. If any of this resonates with your experience, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are still unsure if this program is for you, please reach out to Natalie Hatcher at [nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu).
