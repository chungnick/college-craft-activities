#### COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY: POLICY EQUITY FOR ALL

# OAKLAND SUMMER YOUTH

# EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM

#### ***“The Northeastern C2C Summer Youth Employment Program is exactly the kind of bold, community-rooted initiative we need in the East Bay. It not only provides our young people with critical job skills and exposure to high-growth industries like tech and AI but also reminds them that their voices and visions matter. I’m proud to support.”***

**-Councilmember Rowena Brown, City of Oakland**

#### ***“On behalf of the Oakland Workforce Development Board, we thank Northeastern for their commitment to providing these essential opportunities for young people through your C2C Summer Youth Employment Program. These programs play a crucial role in personal development, economic stability, educational success, and overall community well-being.”***

**-Sofia Navarro, Executive Director of the Workforce Development Board at the City of Oakland**

In our commitment to the wellbeing of East Bay communities, [Community to Community (C2C) Impact Engine](https://impactengines.northeastern.edu/ia/c2c/) launched the first earn-and-learn summer youth employment program on the Oakland campus in 2023. Doubling the program in year two, the five-week program provides experiential work experience, college preparation and career skills workshops to give East Bay youth direct support toward building pathways to higher education and quality jobs. 

Rising high school juniors and seniors from a dozen local schools participate in a wide range of work sites, including Public Safety and Security, The Mills College Children’s School, The Office of Partnerships, The Housing and Residential Life Department, Financial Services, the Farm, Community Engagement and more. They gain on-the-job professional training as well as weekly workshops covering resume writing, interviewing for success, college essay tips, building a LinkedIn profile, financial literacy, mindfulness/managing stress, maximizing brain power, finding your ‘why,’ and more. 

Each summer concludes with a completion ceremony, which includes leaders from the university, city government officials, parents, teachers, and friends. The students present about what they gained from the experience and how it might shape their futures. Northeastern Oakland has launched a full-ride scholarship program, to which some SYEP graduates may apply.

**Bridge to AI Program:**

Launched in 2025, the Bridge to AI initiative introduces high school and college students—especially those from underrepresented communities—to the transformative power of artificial intelligence foundations, ethics, tools, and practice.  The program is a part of the Summer Youth Employment Program with paid workshops one day a week for four weeks.

**-Sebastian Nunez, C2C 2025 Summer Youth Employment Program Participant**

*“This program has given us the tools and confidence to pursue our dreams and I’m grateful for the support of our mentors and the C2C staff. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for all of us and I’m excited to continue building on the foundation me and my peers have created this summer.”*
