**How do I register my child for camp?**

***AFTER December 15th****: Go to* [*summer.mst.edu*](https://summer.mst.edu/) *find your camp tab, and select the* ***Registration*** *link.*

1. *The system will then walk you through filling out and submitting the initial pre-registration form, which requires a $50 (non-refundable/non-transferable fee) deposit be paid at time of registration to hold your spot. If your child is attending a camp between May 31st and July 2nd, full payment must be received by May 15th. If attending a camp between July 12th and July 25th, full payment must be received by June 15th.*
2. *Once you complete your pre-registration form, parents/guardians will receive an email within twenty-four hours with a link to fill out the required camp forms (e.g., medical, dietary, AV release, etc.). These need to be completed online as soon as possible, since your registration is not complete until your full camp registration fee is paid and all required camp forms are received.*
3. *If you received an award or scholarship during an event, please email [stemcenter@mst.edu](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu) a copy of the award certificate and we will apply the dollar amount awarded to your camp fee.*

**If we have to cancel our camper’s registration, will we receive a refund?**

*Yes, if you cancel 14 days prior to the first day of camp.  We will refund all but the non-refundable fee through the method it was paid. The fee is nonrefundable and non-transferable. No refunds are available if a participant attends any part of a week.*

**What is the last day we can register for camp?**

*All camp registrations need to be submitted by May 15th if the camp falls between May 31st and July 2nd, or June 15th if the camp is between July 12th and July 25th.*

**May my camper request a roommate?**

*Absolutely! Just include the names of the camper your camper would like to stay with on the registration form. Please note this is not always possible to fulfill these requests due to other factors.*

**May I sign my student up on the first day of camp?**

*We are unable to register campers on the first day of camp, so please register early! Our STEM camps have limited space and most will fill up very early, even selling out months in advance. When each camp fills up, we create a waiting list and contact families, if and as soon as openings become available.*

**My child has been added to the waitlist for a camp. What does that mean?**

*If a camp is full, you will be asked whether or not you wish to be added to the waitlist and then you can fill out a temporary registration to hold the waitlist spot. These spots are first-come-first-serve. If there is a cancellation within the camp, we will transfer campers from the waitlist in date order.*

**Special Accommodations**

*Missouri S&T is committed to a full and equal opportunity for children to enjoy the camp experience, and reasonable modifications will be considered. While we hope to offer our camps to as wide a range of children as possible, it is not possible for us to offer one-on-one care. If your child has a personal assistant that you would like to attend with your camper, please contact* [*stemcenter@mst.edu*](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu) *to discuss steps to bring them on-site.*

*We ask that you provide detailed answers to the questions about your camper in the registration process. This information will only be shared with camp administration and your camper’s staff. You may also contact Roxanne Hanna, Director of Summer Camp Operations at*[*stemcenter@mst.edu*](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu) *to discuss your family’s specific needs.*

**How will staff be trained and monitored?**

*Each of our camp counselors are required to participate in our training program before they are eligible to lead a summer camp. Our college-aged counselors have experience with K12 children and many are taking classes in education or work in our campus K12 tutoring program or campus daycare.*

*Conditions of employment include, but are not limited to, the following:*

* *First Aid/CPR*

* *Background Checks/Screening Process*

* *Training in safety and emergency procedures*

* *STEM-specific education*
* *All staff receive on-the-job training, and are required to attend staff meetings on a regular basis. Topics include, but are not limited to: Childcare knowledge, group work skills, behavior management, emergency procedures, and program content.*

**What is the staff-to-camper ratio?**

*We offer a staff-to-camper ratio which is compliant with the University of Missouri system standards which is based on age of campers and time of day camps conclude, so you can rest assured that your child will receive the best care and attention. Due to these standards, your child must be in the vicinity of a camp counselor at all times. Please note: though we want our campers to experience campus life, they will not be permitted to explore campus without supervision. Our summer camp programs are led by full-time, year-round Missouri S&T faculty, staff and students. We recruit the best counselors, who come from around the world, on the basis of their STEM focus, personal values and proven ability to work with children.*

| --- | --- | --- |
| *Minor Ratios (Ages)* | *Daytime* | *Overnight* |
| *Ages 15-18 years* | *15:1 (15 campers per 1 adult)* | *10:1* |
| *Ages 9-14 years* | *10:1* | *8:1* |
| *Ages 6-8 years* | *8:1* | *6:1* |

**Where will my camper stay?**

*Usually, your camper will stay at Thomas Jefferson (TJ) Hall 202, W 18th St, Rolla, MO 65409. It is a seven-story, apartment-like building, just to the west of IHOP. There are a few exceptions for camps that go to our Ozark Research Field Station. Typically, your camper will stay with one other camper. Accommodations can be arranged for a private room with a bathroom for an additional nightly fee, please contact the STEM Center staff for more details at 573-341-6204. You may view pictures and take a virtual tour of TJ Hall* [*here*](https://reslife.mst.edu/livingoptions/residencehalls/thomasjeffersonhall/)*.*

***What does TJ Hall have to offer my camper during their camp experience?***

*TJ Hall has a large recreation room, eat-in cafeteria, and the Miner Cafe (note: S&T is a cashless campus, cards required), which is a small convenience store within the hall. Your camper may meet with other campers in the recreation area and request games, movies, equipment for table tennis, balls for pool table, and other outdoor sports equipment during free time. The campers may go to Mobil on the Run which is located close to the hall, although they must arrange this ahead of time with their counselors permission by 9:00 pm. Our counselors will go with them to the gas station.*

**My child will be driving to camp, will they receive a parking pass?**

*If you have indicated on the summer camp form that your camper will be driving themselves, we will collect their vehicle information and license plate number and submit this to our Parking Operations department. Please note that campers are not allowed to drive their vehicles once they are checked-in for camp.*

**May my camper bring their own laptops, gaming devices, jewelry, etc.?**

*Since the Missouri S&T Summer Camps team is not responsible for the damage or loss of anything you bring to camp, we don’t recommend bringing your own equipment or expensive items.*

***Should my camper bring their own bedding?***

*Your camper will want to bring a pillow and bedding for a twin XL mattress OR a sleeping bag. Please check the final communication of the camp to ensure that your child brings the appropriate bedding.*

**My camper is very particular about food and will not eat what is being offered during the camp. Can they order through apps like Doordash?**

*Campers will have the opportunity to order take-out food using their own funds during their free time in TJ Hall. Orders are to be delivered to the main desk on the first floor of TJ, and deliveries must arrive no later than 9:00 p.m. each night.* ***No exceptions will be made.***

**Do you have accommodations for campers with food allergies?**

*We offer a variety of food options, including gluten-free selections. We have an onsite chef that works with all camp dietary restrictions. Although no discount will be given, campers may bring their own food along with a cooler for items that might require refrigeration. All rooms are equipped with a mini refrigerator.*

**How are camper medications administered?**

*Campers must bring medications in the original prescription bottles. A staff member will be assigned to administer medications daily during camp.*

**How much “free time” do campers have during camp?**

*Very little – Missouri S&T summer camps keep kids moving and active! Camp schedules are packed with fun activities, all supervised, to keep your camper safe, engaged and having a great time. Most of our camps offer free time during the evenings to allow opportunities for campers to unwind, make new friends, and participate in recreational activities also.*

**Can my child leave camp to attend special activities (such as ball games, dance recitals, or church)?**

*We recommend limiting any time spent away from camp, so campers may enjoy the full experience. They may leave camp to participate in activities, provided they sign out and back in upon return. Please notify us about any planned activities during check-in, so that our counselors have time to make special arrangements that may be needed during their camp.*

**Can my child bring a cell phone to campus?**

*Cell phones may be brought to camp but only used during limited, specified times. Limiting cell phone access helps campers focus on their activities and/or studies and also helps avoid homesickness. Campers do best when they stay focused, busy, and having fun with their new friends. Family members may call the STEM Center 573.341.6204 in the event of an emergency.*

**How does camp drop-off/pick-up work?**

***Residential Camps*** ***(beginning/end of camp):***

* *Arrive during your scheduled window of time for drop-off and pick-up (Please note: days, times and locations will vary slightly from camp-to-camp (see your final communication for specific drop-off/pick-up times).*

* *Campers (and family) will bring their luggage and bedding to the location for camp check-in (this information will be emailed to you two weeks prior to the start of camp) and check-in with camp staff at the registration desk. They will be given their camp name badge, lanyard, room assignment and key, and any other camp information or materials. Medications will be turned in to camp staff at this time.*

* *Parents are welcome to get campers settled into their assigned room before campers attend the required summer camp orientation session.*

* ***After camp ends****, your child will only be released to the parent/guardian or another authorized adult you have indicated on registration form, however, t****he adult must have photo identification with them to show camp staff****. This list can be updated at any time by calling the STEM Center office at 573.341.6204 or by emailing* [*stemcenter@mst.edu*](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu)*.*

* *All campers are required to clean up their room and make sure that no personal items are left behind.*

***Day Camps*** ***(beginning/end of each day):***  

* ***At the beginning of each day****, arrive during your scheduled window of time for drop-off and pick-up (Please note: days, times and locations will vary slightly from camp-to-camp (see your final communication for specific drop-off/pick-up times).*

* *Campers (and family) will bring their lunch to the location for camp check-in (this information will be emailed to you two weeks prior to the start of camp) and check-in with camp staff at the registration desk. They will be given their camp name badge, lanyard, and any other camp information or materials. They will also turn in all medication to camp staff at this time.*

* ***At the end of each day****, your child will only be released to the parent/guardian or another authorized adult you have indicated on registration form, however, t****he adult must have photo identification with them to show camp staff****. This list can be updated at any time by calling the STEM Center office at 573.341.6204 or by emailing* [*stemcenter@mst.edu*](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu)*.*

* *All campers are required to clean up their classroom space and make sure that no personal items are left behind.*

**Do you have a lost and found?**

*All lost and found items will be kept at camp until the end of the last week of camp, at which time they will be donated to a local charity, if unclaimed. Missouri S&T strongly recommends that you label everything and that you make sure to check your campers room before checkout to ensure that your camper has all of their belongings. Campers who bring valuables of any kind to camp do so at their own risk, so please leave valuables at home. Missouri S&T is not responsible for any damage, loss or theft of personal items brought to camp.*

**What if my camper gets injured or ill while at camp?**

*One of our Lead Counselors will document any situation that results in an injury and will contact the parent/guardian as needed or, in an emergency, will contact 911 and then contact camp administration and the parent/guardian. Your child’s safety is our #1 priority and we do all that we possibly can to assure everyone is safe while at camp.*

**…You didn’t answer my question.**

*So sorry about that! Feel free to contact us 573.341.6204 or* [*stemcenter@mst.edu*](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu) *and we’d be happy to answer any additional questions!*
