## Payments

**Registration Deposit:**

A $50.00 non-refundable deposit is due upon registration in order to hold your child’s spot in their camp. If you apply for a scholarship and do not receive one, the $50.00 deposit will be refunded to you should you withdraw registration from camp.

**Payment Deadlines:**

If the camp you have registered for falls between May 31st and July 2nd, your full camp payment is due by **May 15.** If the camp you have registered for falls between July 12th through July 25th, your full camp payment is due **June 15**.

**Ways to Make Payments:**

You may pay online using Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover credit cards. If you do not wish to make the full payment upon registration, you are welcome to make several payments leading up to the final payment deadline by saving or bookmarking the payment link you are sent in your pre-registration confirmation email. The balance due will be displayed on the payment screen each time you click on the link. 

If you would like to pay by check, you may mail your payment to:

Kummer Center for STEM Education  
300 W. 12th Street  
215 Centennial Hall  
Rolla, MO 65409

The Kummer Center for STEM Education also has a needs-based scholarship program. Please visit our [scholarship information page](https://summer.mst.edu/parentinformation/scholarshipopportunities/) to learn more about it!

**Cancellations and Refunds:**

If cancellation is made fourteen days before the first day of camp, you will receive a full refund, less the $50.00 registration deposit.

## Registration Forms

Missouri S&T requires the following forms to be submitted to complete your child’s camp registration. These are due at the same time full payment is due:

**Medical Information**: 

We ask that you provide your child’s medical history such as allergies or chronic conditions, the prescription medication that they will be bringing to camp, any special dietary needs, date of their last tetanus shot, and insurance/physician information.

**Image/Media Release**: 

This release will grant permission for Missouri S&T to use any images or videos of your child for promotional purposes. There is an option to opt out of this release.

**Youth Program Waiver**: 

This is a legal document which contains our liability waiver and release.

**Individual Camp Permission Forms**: 

If a camp requires additional permission forms, these will be sent in official camp communications.

\* Please note that we are testing a new forms system this year. If you do not receive an email with the form system link within twenty-four hours, you should first check your spam/junk folder, and if it is not there, please reach out to us at [stemcenter@mst.edu](mailto:stemcenter@mst.edu)
