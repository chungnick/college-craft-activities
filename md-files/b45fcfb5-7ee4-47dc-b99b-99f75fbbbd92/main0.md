# Application, Tuition & Scholarships

**Summer Academy 2026 applications are now open! Begin your application [here](https://account.nytedu.com/s/login/SelfRegister?_gl=1*b0z714*_gcl_au*ODI0NjYwOTIuMTc1NjkwNzE3MA..*_ga*MTg0Njc3MzY0My4xNzQwOTk1ODMy*_ga_5RRG2FJTL5*czE3NTkxNDkwNjUkbzEwOCRnMSR0MTc1OTE1NDE3MiRqMzAkbDAkaDA.).**

### Application Process

Summer Academy is open to high school students (grades 10-12) and Graduating Seniors based on the grade the student is entering in the Fall 2026 school year.  Students must be 15 years old by the first day of the program. All students applying to Summer Academy for the first time are required to complete an online application. Returning students do not need to reapply. Our online application can be completed in a few basic steps. As students work through their application, they may save their progress and return to the application before final submission.

1. Fill out basic information
2. Complete a short answer question
3. Pay a $50 application fee (May be paid online via credit card. This fee is non-refundable.)
4. Submit most recent school transcript or report card. Transcripts must be in English and do not need to be official.
5. Provide proof of English proficiency (for non-native speakers) by submitting test scores or completing a consultation with an admissions officer.

*\*Applications will not be considered complete nor reviewed until all information has been submitted. We encourage students to submit their applications as soon as possible as spots tend to fill up quickly.*

### Returning & Deferred Students

We are thrilled that you have decided to study with us again. Students who have been previously accepted to Summer Academy will be automatically admitted for the following year. Students must confirm their personal information, complete one short-essay question, complete the enrollment agreements, and select their courses.

### Application Timeline

All applications are carefully reviewed by our admissions committee. The committee strives to select talented student leaders with diverse interests and ambitions who will contribute to a well-rounded and academically engaging community of students. Each application is reviewed holistically and qualified students who have demonstrated a genuine interest in Summer Academy will be considered for admission to the program. Our goal is to accept as many qualified students as possible. We encourage students to submit their applications as soon as possible as spots tend to fill up quickly.

### Scholarships

Summer Academy is committed to making its programs accessible to students from all backgrounds. We believe financial circumstances should not be a barrier to world-class, pre-collegiate education. Our Scholarship Program aims to improve the availability, access, and equity of learning opportunities by providing scholarships based on financial need. To be considered, students must submit a completed program application, followed by a scholarship application. Scholarships are limited and disbursed on a first-applied, first-awarded basis until all funds have been exhausted. For this reason, we encourage eligible students to apply as soon as possible.

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Summer Academy is committed to fostering a culture that embraces the values of diversity and inclusiveness. We believe that diversity — in all its forms — is a driver for new ideas, creativity, and academic excellence. Moreover, we are dedicated to creating a climate of dignity and respect as well as recruiting and retaining a diverse group of leaders, administrators, faculty, staff, and students. 

Promoting a nurturing, inclusive environment means actively opposing intolerance, bigotry, bias, and discrimination. The policies and educational objectives of Summer Academy further inclusivity and cultural effectiveness. These values are recognized and supported fully by Summer Academy leadership. Additionally, we recognize that the responsibility for maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion lies with all of us.

### Support a Student

Summer Academy regularly works with schools, foundations, education institutions and community-based organizations that work with student populations.
