#### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

* **What is your Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy?**

  Summer Academy is committed to fostering a culture that embraces the values of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness. We believe that diversity — in all its forms — is a driver for new ideas, creativity, and academic excellence. Moreover, we are dedicated to creating a climate of dignity and respect as well as recruiting and retaining a diverse group of leaders, administrators, faculty, staff, and students.  

  Promoting a nurturing, inclusive environment means actively opposing intolerance, bigotry, bias, and discrimination. The policies and educational objectives of Summer Academy further inclusivity and cultural effectiveness. These values are recognized and supported fully by Summer Academy leadership. Additionally, we recognize that the responsibility for maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion lies with all of us.

#### Admissions Process

* **How do I apply for NYC Summer Academy?**

* **How are applications evaluated?**

  Admission to The School of The New York Times’s NYC Summer Academy program is competitive. All applications are carefully reviewed by our admissions committee. Admissions officers seek talented students with diverse interests, ambitions, and writing styles. The committee strives to select critical thinkers who will contribute to a well-rounded, and academically engaging community of students. Each application is reviewed holistically and qualified students who have demonstrated a genuine interest in Summer Academy as well as a strong academic background will be considered for admission to the program. Our goal is to accept as many qualified students as possible and to ensure we are accepting the right students into the right program for them while space remains.
* **Are applications reviewed on a rolling basis?**

  Yes. However, we recommend that students start the application process and submit their application as early as possible to guarantee it is accepted promptly. Applications will not be considered complete nor reviewed until all information has been submitted.
* **How will I be notified of an Admissions decision?**

  All applicants will be notified via email within one to two weeks, but we can often release a decision sooner.
* **Is the admissions decision binding?**

  Admission to Summer Academy is not binding. If accepted, students will have two weeks to decide if they are enrolling by submitting a non-refundable initial payment of $1,500. If a student does not enroll by the enrollment deadline, their space will be forfeited.
* **I have been accepted; how do I enroll?**

  All admitted students must complete an Enrollment Form and submit a nonrefundable initial payment of $1,500 per course to guarantee their place in Summer Academy. Students and parents will be sent an acceptance email containing a link to complete the form and select the course(s) they would like to attend. At the end of the form, the system will prompt you to submit your first payment and enroll.
* **After my application is submitted, can I change it?**

  No, once an application has been submitted, you are not allowed to change it. Please contact the admissions office at [info@nytedu.com](mailto:info@nytedu.com) if you have any questions.
* **Do transcripts have to be official?**

  Transcripts do not have to be official. Unofficial copies are acceptable.
* **Do you require test scores?**

  No, we do not request nor require test scores when considering admission to Summer Academy.
* **How do I log back into to my application?**

#### Tuition and Scholarships

* **Are scholarships available?**

  Yes, Summer Academy is committed to making its programs accessible to students from all backgrounds. We believe financial circumstances should not be a barrier to world-class, pre-collegiate education. Our Scholarship Program aims to improve the availability, access, and equity of learning opportunities by providing scholarships based on financial need.
* **How are scholarship applications evaluated?**

  The Admissions Committee reviews all complete applications holistically. Students who wish to be considered for scholarships must submit a completed program application followed by a scholarship application.
* **If I am not awarded a scholarship, can I still attend?**

  A student’s need for financial assistance has no bearing on admission to the program. Students accepted to the program, but not offered financial aid, may still enroll.
* **What payment plans are available?**

  Students who prefer to pay in installments can set up an automated payment plan at the time they enroll in their courses. Automated payment plans will charge a non-refundable initial payment of $1,500 per term, followed by equal monthly installments through Spring 2026.
* **What payment methods do you accept?**

  Accepted payment methods may include:

  + Credit Cards & Debit Cards: American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa
  + Local Bank Transfer
  + Bank Payment: Checking Account or Saving Account
* **When will full tuition be due?**

  To enroll and reserve a spot in the program, admitted students will be required to pay an initial payment of $1,500 per course. Students will have the option to pay in full or pay by monthly installments due by Spring 2026. Students who enroll after May 1 must have their full payment due two to three weeks prior to the start of the program.
* **What is your refund policy?**

  The first initial payment of $1,500 for Summer Academy is non-refundable. To withdraw from the program for any reason before the start of the term, the student must notify Summer Academy in writing via email, and, depending on the date of withdrawal, a portion of the tuition and fees previously paid may be refunded. No refunds will be given for early departures from a program once it is underway, whether voluntary or otherwise.

  | Date of receipt of written cancellation notification | Percentage of program fees refunded (less non-refundable initial payment of $1,500 and processing fee of $250) |
  | --- | --- |
  | Before February 1 | 100% |
  | February 2 – March 1 | 60% |
  | March 2 – April 15 | 30% |
  | After April 15 | 0% |

  *\*The first initial payment of $1,500 and all processing fees are not eligible for refund.*

  *The application fee is $50 and may be paid online via credit card. This fee is non-refundable.*
* **Can I use my 529 fund to pay for this program?**

  No. The School of The New York Times does not award college credit for its precollege program. Therefore, 529 funds cannot be used.

#### International Applicants

* **Do you provide student visas for international students?**

  Unfortunately, we do not provide student visas, nor do we provide information on how to obtain visas for travel to the United States. We encourage international students to contact their country of origin’s embassy/government office for that information. Letters of verification can be provided upon request.
* **Is there a minimum English language requirement for the program?**

  Admissions policy will be to only admit students who a) are from English-speaking countries or attend an English-speaking school, b) have English proficiency scores, or c) are verified to speak English to a satisfactory degree based on admissions consultation.
* **I don’t have test results and I would prefer to have a consultation with admissions. How do I set one up?** 

  Admissions will reach out to the student directly to schedule the consultation if the student selects the option for a consultation on their application.
* **I have an international bank account; can I pay the tuition via automatic bank payment?**

  All payments must be made directly in the portal using their parent and/or guardian’s contact information used in the program application.

#### Travel & Safety

* **Is New York City safe?**

  NYC is one of the safest big cities in the U.S. While residence halls and classrooms are secure, our campus is part of the city. Students should stay alert, travel in pairs or groups, and review safety expectations with their families before arrival.
* **How will the students get to and from the program to the airport?**

  Academic facilities in Lincoln Center area of New York City are accessible from all three major airports in the New York metropolitan area: John F. Kennedy International (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Taxi service and ride sharing services (such as [Uber Teen](https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/teens/)) are available from all airports.

  The A, B, C, D and 1 subway trains all stop at 59th Street/Columbus Circle.
* **How do I communicate with the program staff during the program?**

  Official activities use public transit with staff. During free time, students may explore the city with peers using our checkout system. Families should discuss guidelines in advance.
* **What do students need to use public transit in New York City?**

  Students are responsible for covering their own public transit costs. To ride the subway or bus, students will need to use the MTA’s OMNY system, which supports contactless payments. Students can tap and ride using a contactless credit or debit card, smartphone or an OMNY card. Traditional MetroCards will no longer be available starting January 1, 2026. We recommend budgeting approximately $6 per round trip.

  We believe the roommate experience is an important part of communal living, helping students build life skills like communication, tolerance, and compromise – often leading to lasting friendships. 

  Students are typically roomed according to age/grade and the self-identified gender listed in their Program Form. Assignments are finalized before arrival and shared at check-in, not before.
