# Scholarship Program

The School of The New York Times is committed to making its programs accessible to students from all backgrounds. We believe financial circumstances should not be a barrier to world-class, pre-collegiate education. Our Scholarship Program aims to improve the availability, access, and equity of learning opportunities by providing scholarships based on financial need.

### How to Apply for Scholarships

To be considered, students must submit a completed program application, followed by a scholarship application. The scholarship application can be completed in a few basic steps. Scholarships are limited and disbursed on a first-applied, first-awarded basis until all funds have been exhausted. For this reason, we encourage eligible students to apply as soon as possible. We cannot guarantee that all eligible applicants will receive scholarship assistance. All decisions will be reviewed within one to two weeks. Scholarship recipients will be allowed to attend one term only.

Please note that upon admission into the program, a non-refundable payment of $1500 per term is required for all students, including scholarship recipients.  Flexible payment plans are available to all families.
