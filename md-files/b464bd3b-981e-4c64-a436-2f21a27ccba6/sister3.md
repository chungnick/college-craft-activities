# College Prep Workshops

College prep workshops at UMass Amherst offer high school students an essential toolkit for college preparedness: practical skills and knowledge to confidently navigate the college application process. Choose from two invaluable online workshops: learn SAT & ACT test prep strategies from bestselling test-prep author Brian Leaf, or craft a true-to-life personal essay using techniques from UMass Amherst's award-winning Writing Program. Or, join us on campus for a weeklong summer intensive covering admissions strategy, essay writing, test prep and more.

Our instructors will provide participants with fresh, up-to-date advice to help them succeed in the ever-evolving college admissions landscape. Students can expect a true workshop-style format, with plenty of opportunities to develop and practice new skills, and get individual feedback in each topic.

**Student Profile**  
Open to current 9th - 12th graders in high school. College prep workshops can be taken on their own, or in tandem with one of our residential or online pre-college programs during the summer.

**Year-Round Sessions**
