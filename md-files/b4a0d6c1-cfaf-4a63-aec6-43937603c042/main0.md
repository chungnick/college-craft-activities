## [CSIRE 2026 application is now open.](https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/csire/application "2025 CSIRE Application")

The Computer Science and Informatics Research Experience (CSIRE) is a nationally recognized summer research program for high-school students who are ready to move beyond textbooks and immerse themselves in real scientific inquiry. Since 2017, CSIRE has welcomed more than 160 students into active research labs in computing, data science, biomedical informatics, and engineering.

Each year, students work directly with faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD mentors across the Departments of Computer Science, Biomedical Informatics, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics & Statistics, Civil Engineering, Radiology, and other affiliated labs. This broad network of mentors enables a wide range of cutting-edge research opportunities.

#### **See more: [list of past faculty mentors](https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/csirefaculty "CSIRE faculty mentors")**

### **What Students Do**

During the six-week program, students join an active research group and contribute to an original project in areas such as machine learning and AI, biomedical informatics, medical imaging, natural language processing, data science, human–computer interaction, computer systems, security, among others. Through hands-on work, they learn to design experiments, write and evaluate code, interpret results, and present scientific findings.

Students also attend research talks, career seminars, lab visits (for commuting students), and social events that enrich the research experience.

### **A Proven Pathway**

Many students continue their projects beyond the summer, resulting in publications, national competition recognition (including Regeneron STS), long-term lab involvement, and admission to top universities. CSIRE research has been published at many conferences in the past. High-quality work may also be submitted to the International Symposium for Undergraduate and High School Researchers.

### **Program Dates for 2026**

**Program**: June 29 – August 8, 2026  
**Application Deadline**: February 15, 2026  
**Initial Decisions**: March 15, 2026 (rolling afterward)
