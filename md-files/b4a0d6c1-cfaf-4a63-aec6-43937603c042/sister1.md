# CSIRE 2026 Application

[Home](/csire) | [Introduction](/csire/introduction) | [Sample Projects](/csire/sampleprojects) | [Past Mentors](/csire/faculty) | [Application](/csire/application) | [News](/csire/news)

## CSIRE 2026 will offer two options: 1) commuter option for local students, and 2) a virtual option for students who cannot commute to campus.  There will be no residential option for 2026.

### **ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS**

**Age Requirement**

* Students must be 14 years old or older by the start of the program.

**Skill Requirements**

Applicants should have:

* Good programming skills (Python, Java, C/C++ or other)
* Understanding of computer science fundamentals

**Other Requirements**

* Students must be currently studying and residing in the United States
* Ability to commit to the full program schedule (commuter or virtual)

### **APPLICATION GUIDELINES**

Applicants must complete the application form, with following information required.

#### **Required Documents**

Essay: You will need to submit an essay (maximum 2 pages) discussing a major topic of interest in computing or data analytics, why it interests you, and why you wish to join CSIRE. The essay should also describe your programming skills and any past computer science projects.

Transcript: A transcript is required (your most recent report card or an unofficial grades printed from your school portal).

Name of a teacher for reference:You will also provide the name of a teacher—science, math, or computer science—who will submit a recommendation letter through a separate link. Please share the link with your teacher

The application will ask for two areas of research interest.  While mentors will review these preferences, final placement depends on available projects and mentor capacity.

#### **Selection Process**

All applications are evaluated by CSIRE mentors. Admission is based on both overall strength and the suitability of a student’s skills for available research projects. Because CSIRE is a research-match program, mentors identify candidates who fit well with specific projects, and each admitted student will have a mentor assigned at the time the offer is made.

Students offered admission must confirm their acceptance within **one week**, along with a **NONREFUNDABLE** payment. If an offer is not accepted, additional offers will be made on a rolling basis.

In rare cases, if a student feels a particular lab is not a suitable match, we will explore alternatives; however, options are limited because each mentor supervises only a small number of students to ensure high-quality project guidance.

#### **Program Expectations**

This is not a teaching-based program, but a hands-on, research-centered experience. Students are expected to work on an authentic research project and present their findings at the Final Research Symposium on the last day.

Virtual students and their families are welcome and encouraged to attend the symposium in person to meet mentors and peers.

Throughout the summer, students will participate in research seminars, career seminars, and— for commuting students—lab visits and social activities that help build community.

### **PROGRAM TIMELINE**

**Application Deadline**: February 15, 2026

**Initial Admission Decisions:** March 15, 2026  
Additional offers will be made on a rolling basis if earlier offers are not accepted.

**Program Dates:** June 29 – August 8, 2026  
Students participate in full-time research (commuter or virtual).

**Final Research Symposium**: August 8, 2026  
Virtual students and families are encouraged to attend the symposium in person.

### **PROGRAM FEE**

The CSIRE program charges a participation fee of $3,900 that helps cover essential program costs, including access to computing resources, research-related supplies, mentoring support, University administrative fee, and other logistical expenses required to run an intensive, research-focused experience. The fee is nonrefundable.
