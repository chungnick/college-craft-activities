## Enrollment FAQs

If accepted, is my spot guaranteed?

Unfortunately, due to the limited space available in each program, the only way to guarantee your spot is to complete your enrollment. All enrollments are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, and many programs reach their enrollment limits very quickly. Because of this, we encourage you to both complete your application as quickly as possible, to increase the likelihood that a seat will still be available in your program of choice, and to complete your enrollment upon acceptance.

What is the enrollment deadline date?

Enrollment dates vary by program. Enrollment is on a first come, first served basis and space is limited, so it is important to note that a program could be full before the enrollment deadline. It is wise to enroll as early as possible, especially for popular summer programs.

What happens if the program is full? Is there an option to be placed on a wait list?

If the program you wish to enroll in is full, you may be placed on a wait list. Your payment will not be processed if you are waitlisted. If space becomes available, we will contact you to re-confirm your interest in attending before proceeding with enrollment.

I’m enrolled in a program, what happens next?

After you enroll, you will receive an enrollment confirmation email. A personalized “MyEnvisionExperience.com” page will be created for you where you can find important program updates, mandatory travel and information forms, a travel checklist, and a press release you can use to notify local media about your participation in this prestigious program. Your email notification will provide details about how to access your MyEnvisionExperience.com page.

Is an Envision Program right for me?

Envision programs are for you if you are an elementary, middle, or high school student interested in exploring future career possibilities, preparing for college, and honing your leadership skills. An Envision program can be your springboard to investigating career pathways and learning to be a leader at school and in your community.

Many of our students are nominated by educators or leaders from youth organizations and participating institutions, but open enrollment is welcome from qualified students seeking this kind of learning experience.

Please see [Program Detail Pages](/educational-experiences) for more details about each Envision experience.

What is Envision's Admissions Criteria?

Envision seeks well-rounded students who can handle the rigor of the programs. The Envision Review Committee accepts students based on the following:

**Academic Achievement:** High school students are required to have a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Middle and elementary school students are not required to provide a GPA.

**Leadership Potential:** Demonstrated leadership for high school students is assessed based on extra-curricular activities and the roles within those activities. Leadership for middle and elementary school students is assessed solely on extracurricular activity participation.

**Career Aspirations:** All students applying must complete two short essay questions (200 to 500 words), where the applicant has the opportunity to state why they are a good fit for Envision and the impact they hope to make in the future.

**Mentor Recommendation:** All students are required to provide the name of a mentor – teacher, guidance counselor, coach, etc. – who can speak to the student’s achievements and maturity, and who may be contacted to provide supporting information for their application.

## Tuition and Financial Assistance FAQs

What is included in the tuition?

For Residential Programs, your tuition includes all curriculum and instruction, program activities, site visits and events, overnight housing, program materials, college credit costs (for applicable High School programs), one meal/day, a Certificate of Achievement, and local transportation during the program.   
  
For Commuter Programs, your tuition includes all curriculum and instruction, program activities, site visits and events, program materials, college credit costs (for applicable High School programs), two or more meals/day, a Certificate of Achievement, and local transportation during the program.

For residential and commuter programs, transportation to and from home and the program location is NOT included in tuition.

While attending all programs, you'll need money for meals not provided, snacks, souvenirs, and other incidentals.

How do I apply for a scholarship or financial assistance?

Envision proudly offers a limited number of scholarships to eligible students, opening the door to young leaders from a variety of backgrounds. Many students also fundraise to pay for most or all their tuition costs. See the Envision [scholarships](/scholarships-and-grants) and [fundraising](/fundraising-and-donations) pages for more information.   
  
If you intend to fundraise to raise program tuition, we encourage you to enroll using our convenient payment plan. That way you have secured your space in the program. It is always a good idea to contact our Office of Admissions once you begin your fundraising campaign.   
  
If you have applied for a scholarship, you will be notified by email approximately two weeks after the scholarship deadline date, or by mail approximately three weeks after the deadline date has passed. The scholarship deadline date can be found on the [scholarships page](/scholarships-and-grants).

Is there a payment plan?

Most Envision programs give you the option of paying your tuition in full or to take advantage of one of our payment plans. See your program’s detail page for payment specifics.

## Travel and Accommodations FAQs

Where will I stay?

Depending on your program, you and other students and staff will reside at safe and secure locations that include hotels, college campuses, and conference centers.

How many students share a room?

Each room will house two to four students, depending on the housing location. You will have your own bed. The bathroom is shared. Please refer to the What to Pack document on your personal [MyEnvisionExperience.com](https://myenvisionexperience.com/login?random=936638800) page for details on whether linens are provided at your housing location and if there are other recommended items you should bring based on the accommodations at your chosen housing location.

Will I have a private bathroom?

Most college dormitories have shared bathrooms on each floor that are divided by gender. Other options may be available upon request prior to the beginning of the program.   
At hotels and conference centers where students may share ensuite bathrooms, students will share their bathrooms with their assigned roommates.   
Students have separate bathrooms from staff.

Can I request a roommate?

We do honor roommate requests that are submitted by the posted deadline and approved by both parties. Requests can be submitted through your personal MyEnvisionExperience.com page. However, one of the important benefits of attending an Envision program is the opportunity to network with and get to know peers outside your current circle of friends.

Do I need to make my own travel arrangements to get to the program location?

Yes. Your tuition does not include transportation between your home and the program location. We recommend that you make the necessary flight or other travel arrangements only AFTER you receive confirmation that you are officially enrolled.

Who will meet me at the airport?

For select programs, Envision staff will meet all students who arrive and depart within the specified travel window(s) at the designated airport. We will also ensure that there is shuttle service to get you from your program’s designated airport to your program site on the first and last day of your program. The shuttle service fee is $75 each way or $150, respectively round-trip. This fee is comparable to, and in some cases less than, what you would pay for a ride-sharing or taxi service, and students will be supervised by staff.   
  
More details about the designated airport, travel windows, and the airport shuttle service will be available on your personal [MyEnvisionExperience.com](https://myenvisionexperience.com/login?random=936638800) page after you enroll in the program.

Where will staff meet me at the airport?

If you are attending the Junior National Young Leaders Conference and arrive within the specified arrival window, an Envision member will meet you at your arrival gate. You may travel with an “Unaccompanied Minor” status with your airline as long as you arrive within the specified arrival window.   
  
More details about “Unaccompanied Minor” status for the Junior National Young Leaders Conference will be available on your personal MyEnvisionExperience.com page after you enroll in the program.   
  
If you are attending a high school program and arrive within the specified arrival window, an Envision staff member will meet you at the designated meeting location in the baggage claim area. Envision staff are unable to meet you at your arrival gate; therefore, you may not travel with an Unaccompanied Minor status with your airline. As airline policies vary, it is important to check with each airline about their “Unaccompanied Minor” requirements before booking your flight(s).

What does Unaccompanied Minor status mean?

When airlines offer the additional assistance of their personnel to a minor traveling without a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult, the airline refers to this as Unaccompanied Minor (UM) status. When flying with Unaccompanied Minor status, an adult must escort the minor to their departure gate and remain at the gate until the flight is in air. Upon the minor’s arrival at their final destination, an authorized adult must be present at the arrival gate to greet the minor and escort them through the airport.   
  
Not all minors are required to travel using Unaccompanied Minor status. Generally, airlines require passengers within a given age bracket to use the Unaccompanied Minor status and each airline has different age requirements to define the status. Additionally, almost all airlines charge a fee for Unaccompanied Minor service. As each airline sets their own Unaccompanied Minor policies and fees, it is advisable to contact the airline directly for specific information.

Does my tuition cover fees associated with traveling as an Unaccompanied Minor?

No. Any fees associated with traveling as an Unaccompanied Minor are not included in the program tuition. Unaccompanied Minor fees are set by the airline and are considered part of your transportation cost, which is not included in the program tuition. Please keep this in mind when choosing your airline.

What is the tuition and travel plan?

Envision offers the option to purchase Tuition and Travel Protection Plan coverage. Plans contain both insurance coverage, underwritten by United States Fire Insurance Company, as well as non-insurance assistance services provided by On Call International. You may purchase this plan when you enroll. You also may select this option after enrollment through your post-enrollment page at MyEnvisionExperience.com. Please note that the benefits, terms & conditions may vary by state. If you or your parents would like more specifics about the Tuition and Travel Protection Plan, please call the plan administrator at [(866) 282-3987](tel:(866) 282-3987).

Will I need to bring spending money?

Students should bring money for off-site meals, snacks, and any gifts or souvenirs. Students will visit gift stores on campus and while out on supervised excursions. Information on recommended dollar amounts and the number of off-site meals will be available on the What to Pack document on your personal MyEnvisionExperience.com page.

Do I need a REAL ID to attend my program?

A REAL ID is a federally compliant driver's license or identification card that meets security standards established by the REAL ID Act. Starting May 7, 2025, for those aged 18 and over, REAL IDs (or another acceptable form of identification) are required to board domestic flights and access certain federal facilities.

## Program FAQs

How will I be supervised?

Your safety and well-being during the program are our highest priority. The program is structured so that you will reside in a safe, controlled environment. You will be closely supervised by professionally trained staff, including advisors who serve as educational facilitators and chaperones, security personnel, operations personnel, and a program lead.   
  
For over 40 years, Envision has achieved a stellar record of safely and successfully enriching the lives of students, providing them with superb educational experiences and professional supervision.    
  
Other Envision safety measures include:

* Greeting students at the designated airport upon their arrival, providing shuttle service directly to the program site, and providing shuttle service back to the airport on Departure Day\*
* Maintaining an overall student-to-staff ratio of 8 to 1 and classroom ratios of between 17-25 to 1
* Attendance is taken throughout the program, and students are required to attend all program activities
* Checking rooms nightly and working with venue security for any after-hours concerns
* Staff member rooms are interspersed among student rooms on each hallway in residential housing
* Equipping all staff members with communication devices   
     
    
  \*There is an additional fee for shuttle service.

What is the code of conduct for Envision programs?

Attending an Envision program is fun, but it is also an honor. Like all meaningful experiences, you only get out of it what you put into your time spent at your program. You are expected to conduct yourself as a mature and responsible leader as you represent your school and community. You must abide by the Student Code of Conduct. You must also abide by and uphold all program rules. Failure to do this may result in dismissal from the program and forfeiture of tuition.

Is there a dress code?

Different programs have their own dress codes, but in general, students are expected to be professional and presentable during program activities and course time. Comfortable shoes should be worn, as students will be walking a great deal during most programs. Detailed information about your specific program’s dress code will be included in your acceptance materials and on [MyEnvisionExperience.com](https://myenvisionexperience.com/login?random=936638800).

Can specific dietary requirements be met?

We make every effort to meet the dietary needs of all our students, provided the request is submitted prior to the start of the conference. When you complete the Student Information Form, you will have the opportunity to make specific dietary requests.

I am a student that requires special accommodation. Can I still attend?

Yes, we encourage you to enroll. Envision by WorldStrides believes in working with families to accommodate student needs and encourages the participation of students who feel prepared to meet the academic, social, physical, and emotional demands of the program environment. We may be able to provide appropriate auxiliary staff and services to assist students as needed if notified in advance. We encourage families, guardians, legal representatives, or educators to contact the [Office of Admissions](/contact-us) for more information and to discuss particular accommodations before applying for enrollment in the program.

How can my parents/guardians content me during the program?

You are permitted to bring a cell phone to keep in touch with your parents, but it must be turned off during program activities. You may call home before activities begin in the morning and after they have ended in the evening.

Your parents or guardians will have the telephone number to the program's on-site office, where they can leave you messages. Additionally, parents and guardians may email the office should they need to relay information to you.

Can my parents attend the program?

No. Your parents or guardians are not allowed to accompany you during the program. Gaining independence, including experiencing new things on your own, is an essential part of your growth during the program. However, it is perfectly fine for your family to travel with you to the program location and stay in the area while you are attending the program.
