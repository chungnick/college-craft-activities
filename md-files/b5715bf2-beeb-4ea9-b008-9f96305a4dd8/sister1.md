# The Goldman Group - LEEDAR - Summer Research Program

**What?**

In conjunction with the LEEDAR Program, the chemistry department of Rutgers University hosts high school students interested in science or research every summer for 6-8 weeks.  This program gives high school students some insight into the experience of working one-on-one with a college professor.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to learn about a specific research project and get hands-on experience working in a university chemistry laboratory.

**Who?**

Any high school junior or senior who has an interest in the chemistry and scientific research.

**When?**

Six to eight weeks of research in a laboratory of your choice, starting at the end of June and extending through the middle of August.  Specific dates will be arranged at the discretion of the professor.

**Why?**

The LEEDAR Summer Research program provides a great introduction to the process of scientific research.  Participating in a summer research program is not only great for resumes and college applications, but it also provides insight into the college experience.

**How?**

The deadline for receipt of applications is June 1st.  Please email a word document or .pdf containing the information listed below and any other additional materials to: This email address is being protected from spambots.
