* [Professional Development](#c30146)
* [Knowledge & Skills](#c30150)
* [Networking & Community](#c30154)

### Research Experience

Each student is paired with a research mentor for a full-time, hands on, authentic research experience. In addition to learning new scientific knowledge and acquiring technical skills, students also experience first hand the process of scientific discovery and observe in real time real world applications of advancements in scientific knowledge. At the end of the summer, students write up their newfound knowledge and scientific work in an abstract and present at our final presentation event.

### Professional Development

The CURE program provides a comprehensive orientation program to prepare students for success in professional environments, particularly in the realm of scientific research at our academic hospitals. The summer is also filled with opportunities for social engagement, professional networking, resume building, career exploration, and personal development.

### Scientific Knowledge and Skills Training

CURE students have access to a plethora of scientific knowledge and skills training opportunities, including scientific seminars, responsible conduct of research training, and journal clubs to learn to dissect scientific literature.

### Networking and Community

Opportunities to expand personal and professional networks are plentiful throughout the summer. Students participate in organized career networking roundtables, conduct informational interviews to explore their personalized academic and career interests, and meet a wide variety of scientific professionals. They are also encouraged to build connections with their peers in the program to develop community through social events and team building days such as our annual visit to Hale Reservation. They are also connected with our extensive alumni network!
