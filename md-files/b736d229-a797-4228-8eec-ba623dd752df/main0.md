## Your Future in Law Starts at Stanford

Your First Step Into the Legal Profession

Picture yourself standing before a judge, case files in hand, ready to deliver your argument. Now imagine preparing that case from start to finish with the support of university legal mentors and Stanford Law School professors. That’s exactly what happens at Envision’s Intensive Law & Trial summer program at Stanford Law School.

This advanced program is designed for highly motivated high school students who want a deep dive into trial law and legal education. Over the course of 10 days at Stanford University, you’ll gain hands-on experience in theory, litigation, trial prep, and public speaking. You’ll meet inspiring legal professionals, attend lectures from Stanford faculty, and collaborate with your peers to build and present a case.

And because no courtroom is an island, you’ll also explore the broader world of law—from legal ethics to the college and law school admissions process. Along the way, you’ll connect with students from across the country who share your passion, forming bonds that go far beyond the courtroom.

Each evening, you’ll unwind with fun, connection-focused activities that bring the whole group together. From an adventurous scavenger hunt to a fast-paced quiz show night and an epic lip sync battle, every night offers a chance to laugh, let loose, and build friendships that last long after your final verdict.

## Testimonials

> "I do not know where to begin! Envision’s Legal Intensive experience at Stanford Law School was one of the best experiences of high school for our son. He came home enthused, inspired and ready to move on to college with the intention of applying to law school upon graduation. We barely heard from him while there because he was so engaged in the program but when we did, we could tell he was growing, learning and having a great time doing so. We noticed this experience draws great kids who are bright, kind, fun and motivated to learn. "

**Christopher ‘25 Alum Parent**

> "The people were enthusiastic, supportive and inspiring. Especially Ryder and Emily. The course itself was really educational and I would definitely recommend it to those curious about the procedures of court. This was the most impactful educational experience I have ever had and the way it was organized made me feel a sense of a belonging."

**Sarah ‘25 Alum**

> "I loved the freedom and the environment. The people I was surrounded with all shared my passion for learning, from my peers to my advisors. Speaking of my advisor's (Brendan) specifically, I found him incredibly knowledgeable on law and mock trial as a whole. I found myself listening when he was teaching witnesses how to act, even though I was an attorney. As for the freedom, I enjoyed the ability I had to just head into the courtyard and study. I could take my learning into my own hands."
