# Summer Pre-College Residential Programs at UMass Amherst

Residential pre-college programs at UMass combine all the major elements of college, including great academics, living in a residence hall, and eating in our award-winning dining commons. Of course, it takes a little help to adjust to life on a college campus, so we have live-in program assistants who are specially trained to help you get used to a new environment. We have lots of fun events in the evenings and on weekends that help you connect with other pre-college students.

Summer 2026 program offerings will be posted in January. In the meantime, check out our Summer 2025 program details below.
