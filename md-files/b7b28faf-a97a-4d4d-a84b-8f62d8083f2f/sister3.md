# College Application Intensive

The College Application Intensive is a comprehensive week-long program dedicated to understanding and preparing for the college application process. A range of key topics will be covered, including an exploration of personal strengths and interests; college majors and career paths; admissions strategy; essay writing; and standardized test prep. Students will also tour UMass Amherst and other local colleges in the Amherst area, and experience campus life while living in a residence hall and enjoying award-winning meals from UMass Dining.

The intensive consists of four modules:

**College Majors and Career Paths:** Each morning will begin with identifying personal interests and goals through guided exercises and activities. Students will utilize a powerful self-assessment tool to assess their own personal strengths, values, and beliefs; develop self-awareness of their unique talents and abilities; explore possible academic majors and career pathways; and make new connections with other students.

**Navigating the Application Process:** Representatives from Undergraduate Admissions and other UMass Amherst campus offices will give presentations, share insights, and answer questions on topics such as college admissions strategy, applying for financial aid, and student success\*. Students will learn what to consider when choosing a best-fit college, tips for presenting themselves successfully to college admissions officers, and more.

**Writing the College Application Essay:** Students will brainstorm, draft, and revise a full-length college application essay. Students will routinely read and analyze each other's work, as well as personal essays by published authors. Together, we will grow comfortable with: (1) the conventions of application writing, (2) vulnerably sharing our stories, and (3) a rigorous revision process involving peer review and instructor feedback.

**SAT & ACT Test Prep:** Studentswill learn what content to expect on each test, strategies for every section, insider tricks and tips to maximize their scores, how to avoid the most common careless errors, and test-day stress management. We will also detail the differences between the SAT and ACT to help students decide which test best fits their learning style. *Students who have already taken the SAT or ACT may choose to opt out of this module.*

*This workshop is offered by the University Without Walls office of Pre-College Programs, and is not affiliated with UMass Amherst Undergraduate Admissions. \*Presenters may be subject to change.*
