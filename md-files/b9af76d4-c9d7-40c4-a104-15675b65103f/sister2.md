## Additional costs

### Short-term health insurance: $259

Expand Short-term health insurance: $259

Medical insurance is mandatory for all students at RISD, including Pre-College students. The college requires all students to carry valid medical insurance to help cover the extra expenses of medical treatment that is not covered by RISD Health Services. All medical insurance policies must be from a US domestic insurance company and accepted in the state of Rhode Island.

If you do not have medical insurance from a US domestic insurance company and/or your insurance is not accepted in the state of Rhode Island, you may purchase a five (5)-week short-term medical insurance policy. The short-term medical insurance fee is paid directly to University Health Plans. To assist in obtaining coverage, University Health Plans Insurance Program offers a [Pre-College Student Health Insurance Plan](https://www.universityhealthplans.com/letters/letter.cgi?group_id=318).

## Withdrawals and refunds

To officially withdraw from Pre-College prior to the start of classes, submit written notification to [precollege@risd.](mailto:precollege@risd.edu)[edu](mailto:precollege@risd.edu). Failure to properly withdraw from the program results in a failing grade. See the "Leaving Campus Early" section of the [Student Handbook](https://cereg.risd.edu/upload/RISD%20Pre-College%20Student%20Handbook.pdf) for more details. Students who do not complete the required vaccinations and health requirements before arriving on campus may be denied entry to the program with no refund provided.

Refunds for voluntary withdrawal after the student has been accepted are granted according to the following schedule. The percentage of the tuition and housing/dining fees refunded, not including deposits, depends on the date the written request is received in the Continuing Education office.

* On or before March 11, 2026: 100% (minus deposit)
* Between March 12–March 31, 2026: 50% (minus deposit)
* On or after April 1, 2026: 0%

For students admitted after the payment deadline, you must submit your deposit within 48 hours of acceptance. Your remaining payment balance is due within five days of your deposit payment. Please note that after April 1, 2026, ALL payments are non-refundable including late admitted student payments made after the payment deadline.

Application fees are non-refundable. No refund or reduction in the total charge will be made for a student who arrives to the program late, leaves the program early, or is dismissed due to a violation of school policies or regulations. The [Pre-College Student Handbook](https://cereg.risd.edu/upload/RISD%20Pre-College%20Student%20Handbook.pdf) more fully describes these regulations.

Refunds take up to six weeks to process. Refunds will be issued in the form of original payment. If the original form of payment was via check, a refund check will be made payable to the primary parent as listed in the student application. For payments made via FlyWire, an applicable refund will be returned in the manner in which it was paid.

## Payment deadline: March 11, 2026

Program deposits are due within five days after your acceptance.

On March 11, 2026, all balances are due. If you apply after this date, you must pay full tuition and fees within five business days after acceptance. You may make payments in any amount at any time up to the payment deadline.
