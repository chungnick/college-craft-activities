# Summer Internships

The UMD Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS) offers paid summer internships mentored by our CISESS scientists to work on NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) projects.

The program is aimed at high school seniors and undergraduate students. Interns are involved in an extensive range of topics, including satellite data assimilation, artificial intelligence, 3D visualization, support for the remote sensing laboratory, and more. Check out the intern projects from last summer on the [CISESS Summer Interns' Page](https://cisess.umd.edu/outreach/students-page/).

CISESS is located at the UMD Discovery District, across the street from the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction. Interns typically work for 20 hours per week for 10-12 weeks.

Please email your resume by March 28 to Kate Cooney, CISESS Coordinator, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#610a12020e0e0f041821140c054f040514).
