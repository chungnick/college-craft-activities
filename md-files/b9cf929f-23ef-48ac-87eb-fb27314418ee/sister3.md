For Summer 2026, the Internship is via a virtual format (online); consequently, we will accept applications from international students and students from outside the immediate area.

## General FAQs

[How will the skills sessions be taught online?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_9)

The technical skills sessions will be conducted virtually using an overhead camera (with zoom lens) to demonstrate in real time fundamental surgical skills and techniques. All the surgical instruments and supplies along with specialized surgical simulators will be sent to each participant; the instruments and simulators are for the student to keep afterwards. The students can direct their laptop camera or cellphone camera onto their workspace so that we can provide feedback during the skills sessions.

[What are the hours and format of the daily activities for the Internship?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_4)

The course includes daily lectures from 9 am to 12 noon, Monday through Friday. Daily interactive skills sessions are conducted from 1 pm to 4 pm. The skills session is hands-on with demonstrations by the instructor concurrent with feedback to the students regarding their performance.

There is additional time for tutorials and office hours.

[When will payment for program fees need to be submitted?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_8)

Confirmation of enrollment and deposit payment are due three weeks after the acceptance letter is sent to admitted students.

[Can I attend if I am a student with special needs?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_7)

Yes. Students with special needs or with disabilities are encouraged to apply. We may be able to provide you with auxiliary aids and services to assist you. Please [email Lucy Neves](mailto:lneves@stanford.edu) for more information or to discuss your particular needs prior to enrolling in the program.

[If there is a family emergency and my child has to leave during the program, will she/he still be able to receive their certificate?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_1)

No. The student must complete the program to receive the certificate.

[Where can we find a list of other summer internships that Stanford provides?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_0_content_3)
