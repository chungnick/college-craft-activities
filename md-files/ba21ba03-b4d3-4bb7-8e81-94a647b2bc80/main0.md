# Quick Facts for Students

> "The close environment of people with a shared passion fosters truly brilliant collaboration, and the structure of each problem set weaves deep thinking and creativity into each day." **Twyla C.**

PROMYS is a six-week summer program in mathematics for strongly motivated high school students who are carefully selected from across the U.S. and around the world. Founded in 1989, PROMYS is a residential program held on the campus of Boston University with approximately 80 high school students and 25 undergraduate counselors.

#### Key Dates

**Application Deadline:** February 27, 2026, 11:59 pm (EST)

#### Cost and Financial Aid & Scholarships

PROMYS believes that cost should not be a barrier to participation. The program is **FREE** for domestic students whose families make under $80,000 per year. Please see the [Financial Aid & Scholarships](/programs/promys/for-students/scholarships/) page to learn about **full and partial** need-based financial aid (including room and board), scholarships, fellowships, and other awards. Financial aid for international students is considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Cost in 2026: Up to $8,000 for the six-week residential program, depending on financial aid award**. [The actual per-student cost to PROMYS of over $10,000 is subsidized for all students thanks to donors and sponsors.]

* Be 14–18 years old
* Have completed 9th grade (or its equivalent)
