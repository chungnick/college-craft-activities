# Financial Aid & Scholarships

> "Thank you so much! This program would not have the same magic it does if it were not accessible to those who need financial aid to attend." **PROMYS 2024 Student**

At PROMYS, we would like every accepted student to attend regardless of financial circumstances. **The program is FREE (including tuition, room, and board) for domestic students whose families make under $80,000 adjusted gross income per year.** Aid for international students is determined on a case-by-case basis. 

We give financial aid based on demonstrated need. Awards can cover up to the full cost of participation for the six weeks of the program. To be considered, please submit a financial aid form by March 15. Applicants can request that the financial aid form be sent to their parents though the application portal. The link to the form will come from notifications@email.submittable.com. More detailed instructions are on the [Application Page](https://promys.org/programs/promys/for-students/application/).

**The chart below gives an approximation of the expected contribution from each U.S. family based on annual income.** Please be aware that financial aid awards vary depending on each family’s particular situation and are based on demonstrated financial need. Therefore, the figures below are only meant to give an estimate of the amount you would be asked to pay.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Family's Adjusted Gross Income** | **Maximum Cost in 2026** |
| $0 – $80,000 | $0 |
| $80,001 – $130,000 | $4,000 (estimate) |
| $130,001 – $180,000 | $6,000 (estimate) |
| $180,000 + | $8,000 |

Some support for travel might be available. Please indicate on your financial aid form if you would like to be considered for travel support.

## International Students

**Financial aid for international students is considered on a case-by-case basis.** If you are an international student who requires financial aid to attend PROMYS, we encourage you to apply and submit a financial aid form by the application deadline.

## Special Scholarships

### Breakout Fellowship to PROMYS

All applicants to PROMYS, both domestic and international, will be under consideration for a Breakout Fellowship, a full scholarship for which there is no separate application.

Generously funded by Jacob Lurie, Terence Tao, and Richard Taylor, recipients of the inaugural [Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics](https://breakthroughprize.org/Prize/3), the Breakout Fellowships to PROMYS were created to enable the participation of mathematically talented students who might not otherwise be able to attend. Thanks to matching donations from PROMYS alumni, there is a fully funded Breakout Fellowship endowment so that one scholarship can be offered annually.

In addition to the opportunities above, funding may be available from other sources such as [Mu Alpha Theta.](https://mualphatheta.org/?grants/summer-grants)
