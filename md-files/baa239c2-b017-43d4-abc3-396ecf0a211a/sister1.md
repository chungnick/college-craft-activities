# 2026 High School National Championship Tournament Logistics Information

The 2026 High School National Championship Tournament (HSNCT) will be held at [the Atlanta Marriott Marquis](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/atlmq-atlanta-marriott-marquis/overview/) and [the Hilton Atlanta](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/atlahhh-hilton-atlanta/) in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 22–24, 2026. The two hotels are connected by a short skybridge. NAQT has guest room blocks in both hotels.

The HSNCT is NAQT’s overall high school championship event. NAQT also runs a [Small School National Championship Tournament](/ssnct/) for [small high schools](/hs/small-school.html). Make sure you are looking at information for the correct tournament. (Qualified Small Schools are welcome to attend the HSNCT, even if they also attend the SSNCT!)

Registration is now open for qualified teams. Rosters may be changed after registration, so it is neither necessary nor desirable to wait to register until a team’s composition has been finalized. Register as soon as possible and update the registration later if necessary.

## Frequently Asked Questions

NAQT has prepared [answers to frequently asked questions](/nationals/faq.jsp) about its national championships.

## Information Desk

Starting Friday evening, NAQT will operate an Information Desk at the Marquis Registration Desk on the Marquis Level in the Marriott. The Information Desk should be the first destination for any questions about or issues with the tournament (other than protests, which must be lodged within the game room).

Participants may also text 213‑279‑6278 (“NAQT”) with questions if it is inconvenient for them to get to the Information Desk. Tournament staff will answer incoming messages as quickly as they can.

In general, lost-and-found items will be taken to the Information Desk during the tournament. We will notify owners to the extent we can identify them. At the end of the tournament, any unclaimed items will be brought to the hotel’s general lost-and-found.

## Rules and Eligibility

Gameplay will follow the [Official NAQT Rules](/rules/). Player eligibility is governed by the [High School Eligibility Rules](/hs/eligibility.html).

## Qualification

Schools [qualify to send teams to the HSNCT](/hsnct/qualification.jsp) through their performance at [tournaments using NAQT questions](/schedule/?hs=true) throughout the year.

Registration is now open for qualified teams. Rosters may be changed after registration, so it is neither necessary nor desirable to wait to register until a team’s composition has been finalized. Register as soon as possible and update the registration later if necessary.

[Register Now](/registration/register.jsp?tournament_id=17102)

The field has historically filled. *Receiving an invitation to the tournament does not guarantee a spot in the field; it merely allows your team to register for a spot if one is available.* Once you have qualified, you should register as soon as you can to ensure your team a spot in the tournament. Last year, the field filled around March 23 (though some teams were promoted from the waitlist after that).

### Wildcards

Teams who have not qualified as of Sunday, February 1, 2026 will be able to request a wildcard invitation (while also continuing to try to qualify automatically by their tournament performance).

### Standby Teams

Teams who don’t receive an invitation may attempt to participate in the tournament on a [standby basis](/hsnct/standby.jsp).
Standby signup begins on Sunday, February 1, 2026. The order of standby teams who sign up in the first 24 hours will be randomized; standby teams who sign up after the first 24 hours will be added to the list in order of signup. Qualified teams may also attend on a standby basis. *Standby teams are not guaranteed to participate*; they are added to the field if replacement or additional teams are needed.

## Field

The field is currently limited to 320 teams; [these teams](/registration/field.jsp?tournament_id=17102) have registered. NAQT may expand the field depending on the level of interest and the availability of resources.

## Format

The tournament will use the same format as in 2025:

### Saturday Preliminary Rounds (1–14)

The preliminary rounds will take place using power-matching, also known as “the card system.” That is, each team’s opponents (after their first game) will depend on their performance in previous rounds, and teams will always face opponents with the same record or as near to the same record as possible. Because of this system, it is not possible to know each team’s opponents in advance.

On Saturday, each team will play seven games in either the Morning Session (rounds 1–7) or the Afternoon Session (rounds 8–14) and be free during the other session.

### Sunday Preliminary Rounds (15–20)

On Sunday morning, every team will play three more games (still according to the same power-matching scheme) and have three byes. Each team will begin using the same card they finished Saturday with, so teams must not lose their cards overnight.

### Playoff Rounds (21–31)

Teams who won six or more of their preliminary games will compete in double-elimination playoffs, except that teams who went exactly 6–4 will begin in the elimination bracket (i.e., as if they had already lost one playoff game). The playoff bracket will be seeded by preliminary win-loss record followed by points per tossup heard. Some teams will have byes in some rounds of the playoffs.

For the finals, there are two possible cases depending on the results of the semifinal round. In the semifinal round, the last team who has not lost in the playoffs will play a team who has taken one loss in the playoffs, while the other game will involve two teams who have each taken one loss in the playoffs. If the team who has not lost in the playoffs wins its semifinal game, then it will have the advantage in a final against the winner of the other semifinal game, that is, the former team need only win one of two games to claim the championship, while the latter team must win two games to claim the championship; meanwhile, the teams who lost the semifinal games will play for third place. If the team who had not yet lost in the playoffs loses its semifinal game, then the final will be a three-team, two-game procedure: the two semifinal winners will play each other, and the winner of that game will play the team who had not lost before the semifinals in a one-game final, while the team eliminated in the semifinal round will finish in fourth place.

All teams eliminated in the same round of the playoffs will be considered tied. Teams who did not make the playoffs will be ranked (behind teams who made the playoffs) by win-loss record followed by points per tossup heard.

### General Note

Situations not covered above will be addressed at the discretion of NAQT. NAQT may revise this format slightly prior to the tournament.

## Fees and Payment

Registration is now open for qualified teams. Rosters may be changed after registration, so it is neither necessary nor desirable to wait to register until a team’s composition has been finalized. Register as soon as possible and update the registration later if necessary.

[Register Now](/registration/register.jsp?tournament_id=17102)

The registration fee is $920 per team.

The registration fee only covers participation in the tournament. It does not cover transportation, lodging, food or other expenses.

### Buzzer Discounts

Teams who bring working buzzer systems to the tournament will be eligible for a $30 discount on the registration fee, per system, [if it meets NAQT’s national-championship standards](/nationals/buzzer-discount-policy.html). *There may be some surprises in that policy! Please read it in advance to make sure your system qualifies.*

Unless otherwise approved by NAQT, no team may receive more than four buzzer-system discounts.

#### Timing

*NAQT will only award the discount for buzzer systems that it receives by 9:30 p.m. Friday and may keep until 7:00 p.m. Sunday; if you cannot commit to those times, do not register to bring a buzzer system!*

#### Early Buzzer Dropoff

While buzzers will be accepted at Friday-night check-in, NAQT will also accept buzzers earlier than that. We are particularly grateful for buzzers dropped off early, as they help us set up rooms for scrimmage games.

#### Buzzer Return

NAQT will begin returning team-provided buzzer systems at 7:00 p.m. on Sunday (and not before, except in emergencies). As mentioned above, this might make it impractical for teams planning to leave as soon as they are eliminated to receive buzzer-system discounts (as their systems will not have been returned at that point). Buzzer return will stay open until very shortly after the awards ceremony. If a team knows in advance they will be unable to pick up their buzzer system in time, they should make special arrangements at check-in; barring other arrangements, unclaimed buzzer systems will be left with the hotel bell desk.

### Other Discounts

Teams attending *both* this tournament and the [Small School National Championship Tournament](/ssnct/) will receive a $125 discount on their HSNCT registration fee.

### Payment

For teams registered by a verified official school coach, payment is generally due by the start of the tournament and will be accepted at check-in, though we strongly prefer earlier payment. NAQT reserves the right to require earlier payment in specific cases.

For teams not registered by a verified official school coach, payment—or confirmation of payment plans from such a coach or from a school administrator—is required within one week of registration.

To request an invoice, once you have entered all the information that can affect costs (but not necessarily entered your roster or other information that doesn’t affect cost), at the bottom of your registration page, click “View Cost.” Verify that the listed information is correct. You will be able to download an invoice and/or pay by credit card.

NAQT accepts checks, but those paying by check must be mindful of the payment timing requirement mentioned above. Checks should be made payable to “NAQT” and should be sent to

> National Academic Quiz Tournaments, LLC  
> 11521 W 69th St  
> Shawnee, KS 66203–3749

Please send questions about billing to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#385a51545451565f785659494c165b5755).

### Cancellation

Teams who cancel their registration between March 1 and March 31 (inclusive) will owe a cancellation fee of $92 (10% of the registration fee). Starting one week after the field first fills or on April 1, whichever comes first, teams who cancel their registration will owe a cancellation fee of $460 (half of the registration fee). Teams who cancel their registration on or after April 24, or who fail to show up to the tournament, will owe a cancellation fee of $920 (the full amount of the registration fee). These deadlines notwithstanding, teams will always have a seven-day grace period after registering during which they can cancel without incurring a fee.

Failure to submit [participation agreements](#participation-agreement) on time may be treated as a cancellation, including incurring a cancellation fee, at NAQT’s discretion.

## Participation Agreements

Players, coaches, and chaperones must sign a participation agreement covering expectations, media coverage, etc. All agreements must be submitted to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88f8e9fafce1ebe1f8e9fcedc8e6e9f9fca6ebe7e5) by Friday, May 8, 2026.

For players’ agreements, both the player and their parent or legal guardian must sign.

[Download Agreement Form](/nationals/participation-agreements/2026-hsnct.pdf)

The signature(s) on the participation agreement must be handwritten, not typed. The agreement may be submitted by sending a scan or photo to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5b5a4b7b1aca6acb5a4b1a085aba4b4b1eba6aaa8). Only the last page is required unless the participant is indicating a preference not to be recorded (in which case the page with the checkbox to indicate that preference must be included).

## Chaperones

Every team must have one official chaperone, subject to the following rules:

* The chaperone must be at least 21 years old.
* The chaperone must be reachable by text message (at a number provided to NAQT) throughout the tournament, to the maximum extent possible given availability of cellular networks.
* The chaperone must be with the team at most times during the tournament and downtime. If the chaperone is not with the team, NAQT is not obligated to contact the chaperone in situations short of an emergency. In particular, NAQT will not contact absent chaperones regarding protests.
* The chaperone must be with the team during travel. If the team is traveling in multiple groups, all groups must be chaperoned during travel by a person who is at least 21 years old.
* The chaperone must always be near enough to the team to (physically) reach them in less than ten minutes.
* (New for 2026) Each team must have a separate chaperone as just described; one person may not be the chaperone for multiple teams.
* The chaperone must complete a [participation agreement](#participation-agreement).
* The chaperone must be the same person for the entire tournament.

All players’ parents/guardians must affirm (via the [participation agreement](#participation-agreement)) that they accept their child’s team’s chaperone and the chaperone’s role of responsibility.

Teams who wish to request a variance from the chaperone policy should write to NAQT at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#630b100d0017230d0212174d000c0e) well in advance of the tournament to discuss their situation.

## Session Assignments

There will be two sessions of play on Saturday.
Each team will be assigned to either the Morning Session or the Afternoon Session; this determines whether it plays its first seven preliminary games on Saturday morning (9:00 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.) or Saturday afternoon (3:00 –7:30 p.m.).
The two groups will be merged for each team’s last three preliminary games on Sunday morning.

Each team may request a specific session.
The first 150 session requests (based on the time the sessions are requested via the registration form, which is not the same as the time of registration itself) will be guaranteed, provided that neither session is requested by more teams than can fit in it.
Session requests after the first 150 will be subject to NAQT’s efforts to balance the sessions and other considerations.
However, for schools that enter multiple teams, NAQT will always honor the school’s preference as to whether those teams are assigned to the same session or spread out (unless doing so is truly impossible).

NAQT will assign and announce sessions no later than May 2.

## Checking In

The primary check-in period will be from 6:00 to 9:30 p.m. in the Marquis Ballroom Foyer (Marriott, Marquis Level) on Friday, May 22.
During this period NAQT will
distribute information folders,
answer questions,
process payments,
verify rosters,
and take care of other administrative matters. There are late check-in periods on Saturday, but NAQT prefers that as many teams as possible check in on Friday night.

To check in, each team should send *their official chaperone* to the check-in area. That person will be given the team’s information folder. People other than official chaperones will not be permitted to check in and should not enter the check-in area.

In past years there has been a long line just after check-in opens, so we encourage teams to keep an eye on the line and send one person to check in when the line is short. *There is no need to check in immediately.* In particular, it is not necessary to check in before playing scrimmage games.

Teams that don’t arrive at the hotel until after check-in closes on Friday may check in early Saturday morning or (if they are in the Afternoon Session) early Saturday afternoon. Teams that checked in on Friday do not need to check in again on Saturday.

## Scrimmages

Between 6:00 and 8:30 p.m. on Friday night, game rooms will be set up for teams to scrimmage against each other on questions from previous championships and/or the regular season. This scrimmaging is free and will be moderated by tournament staff.

Teams that want to participate in the scrimmages should go to the Imperial Ballroom Registration Desk (Marriott, Marquis Level). *A team does not need to have checked in to be allowed to scrimmage.*

Scrimmages will be organized by means of “scrimmage tickets”: When a team shows up to the scrimmage desk, it will be given a ticket listing a room and a time; that team should go to that room and be prepared to play at that time. The majority of tickets will be for games that start within 5 to 15 minutes, but it is possible that there could be a 30-to-45-minute wait during the busiest periods. If a team wants to play another game, it should return to the scrimmage desk to get another ticket after its game finishes.

Scrimmages are open to all players, including alternates and standby teams.

Depending on how many teams want to play scrimmage games, it may be necessary to limit how many games each team can play, but all teams who want to will be able to play at least one game.

## Awards

The teams finishing tied for 33rd place and higher (which is the top 48 teams) will each receive a team trophy, and the members of those teams will receive medals (up to six per team).

The top 40 individual scorers will receive All-Star awards. The top ten freshmen who are not All-Stars, and the top ten sophomores who are not All-Stars, will receive Rising Star Awards. These awards will be determined by points per tossup heard, in the preliminary rounds only, among players who heard at least 120 tossups (approximately six games’ worth). Players in eighth grade and below are not eligible for Rising Star awards.

Trophies for teams (and their players) that finished tied for 8th place and below will be handed out immediately following the game in which the team is eliminated (in the game room, by the moderators). The trophies for the top seven teams will be given out at the Awards Ceremony.

The All-Star and Rising Star awards will be given out at a separate ceremony at 1:15 p.m. on Sunday.

If a team needs to leave prior to the awards ceremony, it can go to the [Information Desk](#information-desk) to get its trophy and any individual awards earned by its members.

## Consolation Games

Teams who do not qualify for the playoffs are encouraged to return at the beginning of the playoffs to play consolation games.

Teams will be texted at the end of the preliminary rounds with a link to a form by which to sign up for consolation tournaments. Teams who sign up by noon Sunday are guaranteed a spot; after that, spots depend on supply, demand, and timing of signup.

Consolation games will consist of two-, three-, four-, and five-round mini-tournaments.
Teams can specify their preference when signing up; they will not be assigned a longer mini-tournament than they request, though depending on supply and demand, they may be assigned a shorter one.
Signing up for consolation mini-tournaments is the only way to participate in consolation games; there are no ad hoc games.

Most consolation mini-tournaments will start at 2:15 p.m., but some may start later.

Consolation games have no effect on a team’s final rank in the tournament.
They are played solely for fun.
They will use the same questions as are being used in the playoffs.

## Transportation

### Flights

Participants should fly into [Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport](http://www.atl.com/) (airport code ATL).

### Ground Transportation

The hotels do not operate a shuttle to or from the airport.

NAQT recommends that participants take the [MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/) train to reach the tournament. It is safe and convenient; there are also taxi and shuttle options, but MARTA will probably be the easiest and cheapest way to travel. It is approximately a 20-minute trip. The fare is $2.50 each way for tickets purchased on MARTA’s Breeze Mobile 2 app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/breeze-mobile-2/id1671615377) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kontron.breeze)) or with a reusable Breeze card (new cards for $2); the fare is $6 for a two-trip paper ticket.

To reach the Marriott Marquis, take a northbound [Red Line](https://www.itsmarta.com/Red-Line.aspx) or [Gold Line](https://www.itsmarta.com/Gold-Line.aspx) train (it doesn’t matter which one) from the airport to Peachtree Center Station (one stop north of the Five Points transfer station). After getting off the train, take the escalator labeled “John Portman Blvd.” to the mezzanine, then follow the signs to “Peachtree Street East” after walking through the fare gate. At street level, turn right (north) on Peachtree Street then right (east) on John Portman Boulevard. The hotel is one block down at the intersection of John Portman Boulevard and Peachtree Center Avenue. [Here is a map of the walking directions.](https://goo.gl/maps/Ye9pqdSZpjG2) Between roughly 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., you can also walk through the Peachtree Center mall and cross the skyway to the Marriott Marquis. The Hilton is through a further walkway after crossing the Marriott Marquis.

### Driving Directions

The Atlanta Marriott Marquis’s address is [265 Peachtree Center Avenue Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia](https://goo.gl/maps/J5wuukoxL7B2).

The Hilton Atlanta’s address is [255 Courtland Street Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia](https://goo.gl/maps/TumUqZcyE2RgPgBf9).

### Parking

Parking standard vehicles at the Hilton Atlanta is $35/day, including in-and-out privileges for overnight guests who book in NAQT’s block; it is $35/day (without in-and-out privileges) for people not staying at the hotel.

Parking standard vehicles at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis is $37/day, including in-and-out privileges. The hotel only offers valet parking, so participants should be prepared to hand over their keys in exchange for a valet ticket when they reach the hotel. Parked cars will not be easily accessible, so participants should remove everything they will need before leaving their car and allow extra time for retrieving their car when leaving.

Overflow parking is available at Truist Plaza (303 Peachtree Street NE) for standard rates. There is also a surface lot across the street.

Groups with large vehicles (vans, buses) should contact their hotel to discuss options for parking. They will likely have to park off-site.

## Hotel

The official hotels for the tournament are [the Atlanta Marriott Marquis](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/atlmq-atlanta-marriott-marquis/overview/) and [the Hilton Atlanta](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/atlahhh-hilton-atlanta/). Rooms are available for $159 per night plus applicable taxes and fees. There are several hotels with similar names in the Atlanta area; make sure you are reserving rooms at one of the correct, downtown hotels!

[Book at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis](https://book.passkey.com/e/51145801)
[Book at the Hilton Atlanta](https://book.passkey.com/go/2026naqthsnct)

The last day to reserve rooms at our rate is Thursday, May 7. There is little difference between the hotels’ accommodations; teams should book in either.

Between the HSNCT and the other events scheduled to be held at the hotels, it is expected that the hotels will run out of rooms. NAQT strongly recommends that teams book their rooms as early as possible, particularly if they want quadruple-occupancy rooms (with two double beds).

We have room blocks that are calculated to cover the entire tournament, but we encourage teams to reserve their rooms as early as possible; if we end up needing more space, we would like as much time as possible to negotiate that!

As part of the contracts negotiated by NAQT, the hotels will offer complimentary guest room Internet access to tournament participants and their families. This only applies to rooms booked using the NAQT group codes.

The standard checkout time at both hotels is 11:00 a.m. Teams that are not staying Sunday night should make sure to check out of their rooms before their Sunday-morning games.

Guests with concerns about rooms on high floors should discuss that with their hotel as early as possible. The hotel *may* be able to assign sleeping rooms on lower floors. However, games may still be held on high floors.

## Food

The hotel is connected by skyway to a food court at Peachtree Center with about two dozen restaurants offering a variety of affordable meals (sandwiches, Thai food, pizza, Chinese food, cheesesteaks, etc.). There are also restaurants in the hotel itself, and more within walking distance, that should satisfy any combination of appetite and price range.

To get to the food court…

1. Go to the Atrium Level of the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.
2. Go toward the side that Atrium A701–A708 are on (the opposite side from the Hilton Atlanta).
3. Turn left between Atrium A702 and Atrium A703, following the signs for Marquis Tower I and Peachtree Center.
4. Walk through the office tower’s lobby area, then cross the skybridge to Peachtree Center.- Explore the food court. There are more parts of it than might first be apparent!

If the Marquis Tower I pathway is closed, instead…

3. Turn right between Atrium A707 and Atrium A708, following the signs for Marquis Tower II and the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
4. Turn left and cross the skybridge to the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
5. Once inside the Hyatt’s atrium, turn left. Follow the signs to Radius Tower and Peachtree Center.
6. Cross the skybridge to Peachtree Center.
7. Explore the food court. There are more parts of it than might first be apparent!

## Honor Code

NAQT works to ensure that quiz bowl is a safe, welcoming, fair, and respectful activity for everyone and expects all participants to do the same.

All tournament participants are bound by the NAQT Honor Code to behave responsibly and ethically. Participants should [read the entire Honor Code](/go/honor-code), but as a summary, all participants must…

1. Treat all people present with courtesy.
2. Avoid action or speech that is hateful or discriminatory toward others.
3. Avoid behavior that disrupts the competitive integrity of quiz bowl.
4. Abide by all decisions of the tournament staff and honestly report details of game situations to tournament staff.

“Participants” for this purpose includes players, coaches, chaperones, institutional representatives, other people associated with a team, spectators, and tournament staff.

Behavior that is in violation of the Honor Code must be reported to tournament staff as soon as is practical.

## Advocate Program

Because NAQT believes that quiz bowl is an activity for everybody, and in which all participants should feel welcome and
respected, we have established the Advocate Program to make sure select tournament staff are available to hear reports about problematic behavior and comments by anyone at the tournament.

Staff wearing blue ribbons that say “Advocate” have been specifically selected to receive reports about inappropriate behavior (as opposed to run-of-the-mill questions about the quiz bowl aspects of the tournament). At least one such staff member will generally be available at the [Information Desk](#information-desk) during tournament hours; if no such person is available (e.g., due to being on a break), the other Information Desk staff can be asked to have a senior tournament official come to the Information Desk to hear the report. Additional Advocate Program staff will be available in many places around the tournament site.

Feedback about problematic behavior can, of course, always be sent to NAQT by email ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8feeebf9e0eceefbeacfe1eefefba1ece0e2)) or other channels such as the [Misconduct Reporting Form](/nationals/reporting-misconduct.jsp), but the Advocate Program is intended to allow for in-person reporting of sensitive complaints on-site so they can be handled immediately.

Reports are confidential to the extent permitted by law and NAQT’s agreements to share critical information with other quiz bowl organizations.

## Practice Material

Participants may be interested in [practicing on questions from previous years](/order/?hs=true) to prepare for the event. All of NAQT’s past regular-season sets are available, as are the sets from previous championships.

Participants may also want to study [frequency lists](/frequency-lists/), [Power Up](/power-up/) study guides, and/or [Thumbs Up!](/thumbs-up/) question anthologies. These are also available on our [practice materials](/order/?hs=true) page.

Finally, participants may want to look at the information contained in NAQT’s free [You Gotta Know](/you-gotta-know/) articles before the tournament. These detail the most frequently asked-about question topics in a wide variety of areas.

## Spectators

Spectators are welcome to attend any part of the tournament (though some areas may have limited capacity).

No registration or tickets are required for spectators.

## Sightseeing

[View Sightseeing Recommendations](/nationals/sightseeing/atlanta-downtown.jsp)

## Social Media

The official hashtag for the tournament is hsnct; please use this tag for all posts about the tournament.

*Remember that question content for the championship cannot be posted online* (or shared through other channels)! This means that players, coaches, spectators, and moderators should not discuss clues, answers, or even overall themes (e.g., “Lots of opera”) with people on other teams (even those from the same school).

Livebloggers will cover the tournament on NAQT’s social media.

## Companion Mobile App

NAQT has created a companion mobile app for attendees. The app includes the tournament schedule (with the ability to set reminders for various events), links to results, maps of the venue, help reaching the Information Desk, connections to social media, and other important documents related to the tournament.

## Relationship to the SSNCT

[Small Schools](/hs/small-school.html) are eligible and welcome to attend the HSNCT (if qualified), regardless of whether they attend the [Small School National Championship Tournament](/ssnct/).
The SSNCT and HSNCT will use different question sets, and a school that attends both will receive a $125 discount on its HSNCT registration fee.

## Further Questions

To ask specific questions about the HSNCT, write to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#573f2439342317393626237934383a).

We look forward to answering any and all questions, no matter how expansive or trivial, in the hopes of eliminating any possible confusion or mistakes in participants’ plans. If something’s not clear, let us know!
