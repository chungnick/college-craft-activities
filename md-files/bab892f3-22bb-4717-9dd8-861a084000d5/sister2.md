# Tuition and Financial Aid

Tuition is an investment in your future—and a degree from Penn State Behrend is an especially sound investment. A Penn State education is recognized and valued by employers around the world.

Tuition and financial aid processes can be complicated and intimidating. That's where our expert financial aid staff can help. They'll identify the combination of financial aid sources that's right for you and your family.

## Tuition: Consider the Big Picture

When you're weighing college costs, make sure to look at the bottom line―the total amount you'll end up paying, even after any financial aid you might receive. And don't forget to consider other factors, like the time to graduation, the value of your degree, and the opportunities that await you after graduation.
