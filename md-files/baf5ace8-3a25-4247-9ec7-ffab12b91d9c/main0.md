## About the Program

The Research Experience for High School Students program, a part of the San Diego Supercomputer Center’s (SDSC) student outreach program, has been developed to help increase awareness of computational science and related fields of research to students in the San Diego region. Students gain exposure to career options, hands-on computational experience, work readiness skills and mentoring by computational research scientists.

Through the **eight-week volunteer program**, students are involved with an established research project. Students learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, conduct computational experiments, and draw conclusions from those experiments. They also learn to take part in regular lab meetings and participate in group discussions. At the end of the program, students will develop scientific posters, reflecting on their summer experience and highlighting their research and future career goals. Posters will be displayed during a celebratory event in mid-August.

## Important Dates

Application Window Opens: February 15, 2026   
Application Window Closes: March 15, 20/26

## The Application Process

1

Students will submit their online applications as in the past.

Mentors will review applications and interview student applicants.

2

3

Students who are selected for the program and who accept the opportunity will then be sent an REHS student registration link.

Registration will be due by the end of May. Please remember that students may only do one REHS internship in the summer.

## Program Fee

**Application Fee: Free  
Research Project: $1500  
Non-Reseach Project: Exempted Registration Fee**

Due to the rising administrative costs associated with the REHS program, it has become necessary to now charge a $1500 registration for this coveted eight-week experience. As a non-profit entity, it has become increasingly difficult these past few years to cover program expenses. We have embraced the support that you as a community have given to SDSC and REHS, and we hope that this registration does not impact the support you have given us for the past decade.

Financial assistance is available. In addition, students who qualify for free and reduced lunch will be exempt from the registration fee.

## How REHS Works

**The UCSD REHS program is an opportunity for motivated high school students to work with a UCSD mentor at the San Diego Supercomputer Center for an eight-week period during the summer.**

Students may choose from a variety of individual project opportunities to learn more about a potential research or career interest through software instruction, assigned scholarly or practical readings and discussions with their mentor and his/her graduate student team members.

Students work in pairs or small groups, which allows students to learn and grow as they work with peers who have the same interest.

We encourage students to make the most of this opportunity, as they will have 1:1 access to the mentor’s expertise. With this internship, there is a specified number of hours required per week by the mentor. Each project description will have specified hours listed. Most are between 15-20 hours per week.

**The opportunity to work with prestigious scientist and staff personnel is something very special, and we encourage you to make the most of it.**

## What the Program Does Not Offer

The REHS program is not a tutoring program. Please do not complete an application because you need assistance with AP Biology or AP Chemistry.

## Administration of the REHS Program

The REHS Internship Program is administered by the UCSD San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The REHS Coordinators facilitate the administrative volunteer orientation and paperwork process for students and background check for mentors, as well as pairing of Faculty and Post Doc mentors with San Diego County high school students in grades 10-12.  
  
**The REHS Coordinator has four main responsibilities:**

1

Facilitate the matching and notification of mentoring pairs

2

Provide a one-time Spring orientation for selected students, and maintain communication with students and mentors to discuss progress of mentor-student pairs

3

Research, develop, and maintain a comprehensive university-wide resource list of all faculty development resources, programs, and opportunities on campus

4

Maintain the REHS website for the mentors and students on which is posted a variety of resources and through which regular communication can be maintained with mentors, students, and interested campus and community members

## Transportation Options

If you know that you will need transportation to get to the main UCSD campus, please do not worry. We will provide students with transportation needs through an MTS Compass card for the internship period.  
  
Once we receive word from your mentor that you have been selected, we will email all selected students to ask if there are transportation needs. This will be your chance to let us know.

## The REHS Mission

The mission of the REHS program is to enhance a student’s lifelong personal development in teaching, scholarship, and service. The mentoring relationships will support collegiality, effective communication, self-evaluation, and cultural competence, all of which enhance a stimulating and supportive university environment.
