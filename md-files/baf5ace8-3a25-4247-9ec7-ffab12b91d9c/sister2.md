# The REHS Application

## Important Dates to Remember

**Program Date**s: June 8 – July 31, 2026   
Application process is Open on February 15, 2026.   
Application deadline is March 15, 2026. aaaaaaaaaaab  
**Notification Window** is May 1 – May 15, 2026.

## Eligibility

* Applicants must be a **Southern California residents** and have completed their most recent semester of high school and be in **grade 10, 11 or 12** at a public or private high school or in a home school setting within Southern California.
* Applicants must be **at least 16 years of age** on or before June 15 of the application year. There are no exceptions.
* One year each of high school level **chemistry or biology** is recommended but not required for full consideration. Please check each project prerequisite as project requirements vary.
* Applicants must have a **minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and be college bound**. Please include your non-weighted GPA.
* Completion of an **REHS Final Poster** and attendance at the Poster Session itself is mandatory. If you know that you will be unable to attend this event, please DO NOT apply.

## The Application

As students will notice, the application is similar to previous internship applications that UCSD has used for other programs, but with a few less requirements.  
  
Please complete the REHS application thoughtfully and completely. You cannot take back a first impression. You may apply for up to two projects, so please be sure to indicate Selection #1 and #2. You do not need to apply for two projects, but the option is there if you wish to do so.

Please Remember To:

* Address your cover letter to your first choice mentor.
* Provide a well crafted resume
* Write thoughtfully. Check for spelling errors.
* Be honest. If your grades slipped a little, explain why. We all have issues that present themselves and that sometimes hinder achievement. A simple explanation is all you need.
* Write a thoughtful essay as to why you wish to participate.
* Be thorough. Refer to the checklist before submitting your application.

Please DO NOT:

* Ask your parent to write your essay.
* Reuse a school essay. We can spot these a mile away!
* Use slang. (Yes, this has happened.)
* Address the mentor incorrectly in your cover letter. Please be sure to use Dr. when warranted and please do not use Dr. when the mentor does not have a doctorate. This seems like a small mistake, but it can count against you.

Once your online applications are submitted, they will be sent to the REHS mentors for review and student selection.  
Selected students will be notified in **early May**.

## Mentor and Project Selection

Approximately **10 renowned research and staff mentors** have signed on to participate in REHS.

Before reviewing the mentor list, students should consider their own goals with regard to the program:

* Is this an opportunity to learn more about a particular research interest?
* Or an opportunity to confirm a passion for a certain career goal?
* Or maybe the student wishes to know more about a particular topic, such as neuroscience, before setting their sights on this as a career goal?

KNOW

Your expectations for the program before viewing the mentor list as you do not want to confuse yourself with the broad range of disciplines that the mentors represent.

REVIEW

The REHS mentor list thoughtfully and unhurried as there is quite a bit of information to absorb. Mentors are listed alphabetically by last name. Each mentor has provided a photo, biography, lab or workplace focus, and a project description.

VERIFY

Your interest in a particular mentor also means that you are interested in the mentor’s project. The project list can be found on Project Description page under the Internships tab.

## **PLEASE NOTE:**

Mentors will be reviewing all submitted applications and will make their own selections. REHS Coordinators are not involved in the selection process.  
  
If you have any questions while viewing the mentor page, please DO NOT contact the mentor directly, but rather contact the REHS Coordinators.

## Application Review Process

The REHS mentors submitting applications for a high school mentee will receive their student applications mid-March. Mentors will be asked to make their student selections by early May. The program continues through the second week of August.

## Need Guidance?

Please do not hesitate to work with your school counselor to discuss how the REHS program can help you advance your research or career interests and goals. Many of your school personnel attended a REHS Overview session and may have the answers you need.  
  
Please also feel free to contact the REHS Coordinators for guidance. We are here to help! Please contact Ange Mason of the San Diego Supercomputer Center (amason@ucsd.edu, 858 534-5064). We are available to provide guidance and answer any questions you might have. Just ask!
