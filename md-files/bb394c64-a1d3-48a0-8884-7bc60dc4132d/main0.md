# STEM Research Experience

[**Click Here to Apply**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLrCW5NsjHL8gxeThNdcNafFE-ocruAgexoMPA8pRCqfNO_w/viewform)

**Note: This is NOT a residential program.**

CU Science Discovery's summer STEM Research Experience offers an exciting opportunity for STEM-interested teens to gain hands-on research experience in a STEM discipline. CU Boulder and CU Anschutz Medical Campus faculty and graduate students serve as Research Mentors in this seven-week summer program. Each Mentor works with a pair of students, based on their research interests. Students participate in a Research Methods seminar (held each Monday) and work an additional 15-20 hours a week, Tuesday-Friday, on their research project. Specific research schedules may vary among different labs, based on the needs and timing of the research project. Readings and assignments may be assigned prior to the start of the program. 

Throughout the course of the program, participants will engage in the scientific research process, including reviewing scientific literature; supporting experiments; collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data; and developing a scientific poster to communicate their results. All participants will present their research at a culminating poster session on July 31, 2026.

### Course details for the 2026 summer program:

* All applicants must be 16 years of age by the start date of the program on June 3, 2026. No exceptions will be made.
* **Dates:**
  + **June 3-July 31, 2026** (no programming June 29-July 3, 2026)
  + **Poster Session:** July 31, 2026 (AM: Anschutz; PM: Boulder; complete details to be provided to participants at a later date).
  + **Cost:**$2,400 and includes the following (Note: Limited scholarship funding is available to support students with financial need. Students intending to seek scholarship support must indicate so when completing their application.):
    - A stipend for the Research Mentor.
    - A materials fee (to support the cost of research equipment and materials).
    - Professionally printed research poster to present at the poster session (one per student).
    - Research Methods seminar class that will meet once per week to support all students throughout their research projects.
    - Daily parking permit or bus pass (CU Anschutz Medical campus only). Note: Parking permits will not be issued for the CU Boulder campus. Alternative transportation is encouraged.
* **Note: This is a commuter program and does not offer residential accommodations. Program administrators are not permitted to offer recommendations on accommodations.**
* **Overseas applicants will be required to show proof of Visa prior to registering for the course. CU Science Discovery does not have a process in place to assist students in obtaining a Visa for this non-degree seeking program.**
* Course participants will be grouped by research interest and assigned to a mentor that will guide them through the learning experience. Outside of class time, students will meet with mentors in the research lab to discuss research topics, learn techniques and conduct research.
* Between live class time, Mentor + Student group meetings and completing independent research, this course will require approximately 15-20 hours each week (specific schedule TBD depending on research project).
* The course will conclude with a STEM Research Expo, in which each student will present a scientific poster highlighting the results of their summer research. Participants are encouraged to invite family, friends and fellow researchers to join them at the expo.
* Beyond the summer course, participants interested in continuing their research are often encouraged to do so by their mentors. Previous participants have gone on to publish their work with their collaborators in scientific journals and present their work at professional conferences.

### Application process:

[**Click Here to Apply**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLrCW5NsjHL8gxeThNdcNafFE-ocruAgexoMPA8pRCqfNO_w/viewform)

Admission to the STEM Research Experience is selective and requires an application. Those not selected during the initial review may be placed on a waitlist. Waitlisted students will be informed immediately via email if a spot becomes available. Admissions decisions are made by CU Science Discovery. Payment will be required upon admittance to the program. Once a student has been registered and payment has been accepted, the registrant is committed to taking the spot - as a result, **no refund will be issued in the event of a cancellation**. Please consider this when determining whether or not to accept a spot.

**Application Deadline: March 2, 2026, 11:59pm MT** (Notification by March 13, 2026).

### Examples of past research topics include:

* Aerospace Engineering Sciences
* Bioengineering
* Biology
* Biophysics and Biochemistry
* Chemistry
* Computational Biology
* Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
* Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering
* Engineering
* Geological Sciences
* Hydrology
* Immunology
* Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research
* Mechanical Engineering
* Medicine
* Microbiology
* Neuroscience
* Pharmaceuticals
* Pulmonary Science and Critical Medicine

This list is provided to give applicants an idea of what topics have been offered in past years. Each year this program relies on the willingness of graduate students to participate in the program. As such, Science Discovery cannot guarantee that a specific research topic will be offered in any given year. Topics chosen are based on the research fields represented by the mentors who have applied to participate. High school applicants will be accepted and placed based on their interests.

**Important note for participants:** Participants will not be permitted to select specific research projects, mentors, or topics in advance and should be open to doing a project with any Science Discovery mentors. It will be necessary for all applicants to enter this program with an open mind and a willingness to explore any number of STEM research fields. Students placed on the CU Anschutz campus will be matched with mentors prior to June 3 and will need to be responsive to emails requesting information. Students on the CU Boulder campus will attend the orientation on June 3 and participate in a “science speed dating” activity where they will meet all participating mentors and hear about their projects.

Science Discovery will do its best to match applicants with preferred mentors, but specific projects or mentors cannot be guaranteed.

**To reiterate, this is NOT a residential program.**
