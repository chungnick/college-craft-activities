## 2026 Summer Sessions

Tapia Camps are a 6-day/5-night program at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Food and lodging is provided, and campers live in the dormitories and spend their instruction time in the buildings on campus. A field trip will take place within Houston (e.g. at NASA Johnson Space Center).

**Camp Pricing for Individual Campers\*:**

Early Bird (before Feb. 1, 2026): $2,200 per student

Regular (before May 1, 2026): $2,500 per student

*\*Discounted pricing for school officials and large groups is available. Please email us at tapiacenter@rice.edu.*

**Sessions:**

**STEM Camps:** Tapia STEM Camps explore a wide range of STEM topics through hands-on challenges and activities. Students will be able to participate in a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activity, where they simulate storing carbon underground to reduce the impact of carbon emissions. They will also take on a heat-transfer challenge by building their own heatsink, a device that removes heat from electronics (such as a laptop) by absorbing it and releasing it into the surrounding air.

Beyond these activities, students engage in additional educational opportunities, including the STEM Fair: an interactive science and engineering showcase with booths led by university students, featuring demonstrations and mini-projects in mathematics, physics, geology, and other STEM fields.

**Techniques of a Pro Mathematician:** In this special session of STEM Camp, campers will learn techniques that professionals use to do mathematics with ease. This session is intended for high school students who excel at math and would like to have a summer camp experience with additional challenge and rigor. This session will be led by Professor Paul Hand. Prerequisites: Campers must have completed a high school geometry class, and be familiar with the definitions of sine, cosine and tangent (SOHCAHTOA), including the ability to sketch plots of sin(x) and cos(x) by hand, by June 2026. To participate in this program, campers must complete an application process. [Learn more about this special session and how to enroll here](/techniques-pro-mathematician).

## What Makes Tapia Camps Special?

## 

#### 

#### Challenging STEM Curriculum

At Tapia Camps, campers will have the opportunity to choose between a variety of STEM projects to focus on throughout the week, including projects involving college admission algorithms and carbon storage. Campers learn directly from Rice University students, with course material designed by researchers led by the camp director, Professor Paul Hand. Students enjoy the college experience while interacting with college students, professors and STEM professionals.

#### Communication

To have a successful career in STEM, and in other fields, individuals must be able to communicate their ideas effectively and be able to work in teams. Campers learn and practice public speaking skills and collaborate with fellow students to complete STEM projects. At the end of the camp, campers present their final projects in front of professors and students.

## Tapia STEM Camps FAQ

What information can you provide about the dorm rooms?
:   Campers will stay in a dorm room. They may or may not have a roommate. Roommates will be assigned randomly. All campers will be assigned a camp counselor. Camp counselors are available at any time the campers are in the dorms in order to provide support and in case of emergency. Campers may have a bathroom in their dorm room or may share a bathroom with approximately 3 other campers. Dorm rooms do not include linens or toiletries. Each room has its own thermostat and air conditioning.

Will classrooms be organized by grade?
:   At Tapia Camps, classrooms will be loosely organized by grade. For the Carbon Project, we anticipate there will be a classroom dedicated toward 8-9th graders, another toward 10th graders, and another toward 11-12th graders. The exact composition of each classroom will depend on the specific enrollment of each week of camp. Each classroom will complete the projects and lessons with a depth appropriate for the campers in that classroom.

What information can you provide about the food?
:   Campers will eat three meals a day at a university servery. The meals are all-you-can-eat. During each meal, there are plentiful options from which each camper can select. Examples of food include: entrees, pizza, grill station, salad bar, cereals, dessert, and a variety of beverages. Campers with dietary restrictions should refer to signage of each item and talk to the chef as needed. Rice University is accustomed to addressing a wide variety of dietary restrictions, including gluten free, nut allergies, vegetarian, and vegan options. More information can be provided at [dining.rice.edu](https://dining.rice.edu).

Will campers be supervised throughout the day and night?
:   Yes. During class time, instructors are responsible for supervising campers. During evening programming and overnight, counselors are responsible for supervising campers. All staff are available to address camper needs, and we encourage campers to speak to a staff member if there is anything we can do to enhance their experience.

What more can you tell me more about the staff?
:   Junior camp staff are typically undergraduate or graduate students. Many attend Rice University, and they come from a variety of fields of study. All staff are trained in CPR/first aid and have completed background checks. In Summer 2024 and in 2023, our staff have collectively spoken over 10 languages each year. Senior camp staff are professional educators from both K-12 and university settings, with over 60 years of collective professional experience.

What is a typical day like at Tapia Camps?
:   Campers will wake up and eat breakfast with their counselor group. They will then have instruction on a topic in STEM of their choice and communication throughout the morning and after lunch. They will complete hands-on activities related to their STEM projects, prepare a presentation for the Friday of camp week, and interact with guest speakers. After their STEM project sessions, campers will participate in fun nightly activities. In the past, students have enjoyed scavenger hunts, STEM Olympics, soccer, basketball and volleyball matches, talent shows, and much more. Please check back here closer to camp for a more detailed schedule.

Do campers need to bring their own computers?
:   No, bringing a computer is not necessary. If required for the project, we will provide campers access to computers.

Do the camps provide school credit?
:   No, Tapia Camps does not award any school credit.

Do you offer any scholarships or discounts?
:   A limited number of scholarships will be available for the 2025 camps. Those will be distributed based on an application process. Please email us at tapiacenter@rice.edu to receive the Scholarship Application. Applications will be due **May 15th, 2026**.

    As for discounts, we offer a 10% discount for Rice alumni or staff, and a 5% discount for siblings. We do not offer the two options combined (for example a 15% discount). Please email us for the discount codes.

Can family members visit during camp?
:   Families are welcome to see camper presentations on Friday mornings. Outside of this time, we do not allow family visits in order to enable campers to fully engage in camp the instructional and social aspects of camp life.

Who do we contact in case of emergency?
:   The names and phone numbers of senior camp staff will be printed on the back of every nametag. These numbers will be shared via email with families a week prior to camp.

Is it ok if my camper can not attend the entire week?
:   We strongly encourage campers to attend the full program. Camp is packed with group work and curricular activities that culminate toward the Friday presentation competition. Any time away from camp puts a camper and their group at a disadvantage in the competition.

I am a representative of a school district. Who can I contact for more information and special rate?
:   We have special pricing available for school districts sending multiple campers. Please email tapiacenter@rice.edu to schedule a Zoom meeting to discuss your needs.

What prior knowledge/coursework is required for each project?
:   Campers interested in *Techniques of a Pro Mathematician* are expected to have completed high school-level geometry and have a basic understanding of the sine and cosine functions.

    There are no pre-requisites for the *Carbon Storage* and *College Admissions* projects.

What is your cancellation and refund policy?
:   **Cancellation and Refund Policy**

    * Cancellations before May 1, 2026 will receive a full tuition refund minus a $100 cancellation fee.
    * Cancellations between May 1 – 15, 2026 will receive a refund of 50% of the tuition minus a $100 cancellation fee.
