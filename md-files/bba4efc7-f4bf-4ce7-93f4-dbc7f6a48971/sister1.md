Techniques of a Pro Mathematician

Techniques of a Pro Mathematician is a week-long residential summer camp intended for high school students who excel at math and want to be challenged in a rigorous college setting with like-minded peers. This program is a special session of the [Tapia STEM Camps](/tapia-stem-camps) and will help you learn advanced techniques that professionals use to do math with ease. These techniques will allow you to think about mathematics with more intention and organization. Afterward, you will be able to learn math more efficiently and effectively, enabling you to tackle more challenging problems. If you are interested in pursuing a college degree in STEM, mastering these techniques will make your future math classes feel easier and more enjoyable.

> **92%** of campers said the camp changed the way they think about math

The program believes that excellence in mathematics comes not from knowing a lot of mathematical results, but instead from mastering fundamental techniques of mathematical thinking. You can learn these techniques using high-school mathematics, and you should practice them so that they become automatic before you reach college-level mathematics.

The unifying theme behind the techniques in this program is communication with others and yourself. During the program, you will learn and practice mathematical techniques, solve a series of mathematical problems, and give a technical mathematics presentation.

As part of this program, you are expected to:

* practice the fundamental skills that you learn
* implement feedback about your mathematical skills
* help your classmates

> **84%** of campers said the techniques they learned at camp have helped them in school.

#### 

#### Prerequisites

The program requires students to have completed a high school level course in geometry and to be familiar with the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent (SOHCAHTOA), including the ability to sketch plots of sin(x) and cos(x) by hand, by June 2026

#### 

#### How to Register

To be officially accepted into the Techniques of a Pro Mathematician session, you must do the following:

1. Register for a spot at Tapia Camps using the link below corresponding to the week you wish to attend.
2. [Download this Heatsink Activity](/sites/g/files/bxs2881/files/inline-files/Heatsink%20Activity_0.pdf) and complete it.
3. Submit your solution by email to [tapiacenter+math@rice.edu](mailto:tapiacenter%2Btechniques@rice.edu)
4. Dr. Hand will provide written feedback based on your solution. He aims to provide that feedback within 1 week.
5. Based on that feedback, you must revise and resubmit your work.
6. If your revisions show the ability to implement Dr. Hand's feedback, you will be officially accepted into the session.

Note: If you have not completed the activity by May 1, you will automatically be registered for the Tapia STEM camp. If you would prefer not to attend, you may request a full refund before this date.

**Techniques of a Pro Mathematician will be offered during each 2026 Camp session:**

* Session 1: July 5 - 10, [Register here](https://signup.rice.edu/tapiacamps2026wk1/)

## The Impact of Techniques of a Pro Mathematician

> My son did the math camp with Dr. Hand. I think he was challenged, engaged and fulfilled in the week. On the day when parents were invited in, I was particularly impressed at Dr. Hand’s method of approaching mathematics. Finding a way to connect the importance of a strong foundation in life to math camp correlated to the way we teach our kids at home.

> [The Techniques program] wasn’t just learning formulas […] we actually understood every part of the equation. We could memorize them because we understood them

## Tapia Camps

Tapia Camps are a 6-day/5-night program at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Food and lodging is provided, and campers live in the dormitories and spend their instruction time in the buildings on campus.

**Camp Pricing for Individual Campers\*:**

* Early Bird (before Feb. 1, 2026): $2,200 per student
* Regular (before May 1, 2026): $2,500 per student

*\*Discounted pricing for school officials and large groups is available. Please reach out to us by email at tapiacenter@rice.edu.*
