### Leadership Intensive Curriculum Components

Examine course themes and concepts through academic research and topic-focused presentations designed to build your skills. Dialogue with peers to identify diverse viewpoints and consider new ideas in your leadership development.

**Independent Course Work**  
Dig into theories, models and current events that help you consider new ideas and ways of approaching your leadership development. Apply course material through guided questions and engaging assignments that broaden your perspective and build critical thinking skills.

**Speakers**  
Meet with government, business, and nonprofit leaders at the top of their fields to hear their experiences and paths to socially responsible leadership.

**Teambuilding**  
Build communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills with classmates through instructor-led activities.

Our Leadership Intensive courses draw from a diverse student body, and our inclusive class communities honor multiple perspectives and interpretations of leadership. Courses are appropriate for students at various comfort and skill levels, and instruction will be tailored to meet students of diverse backgrounds and talents.

Course Environment

Our online courses are designed to allow each student to explore their strengths and potential as an engaged and creative leader through:

* Weekly live, online class sessions, 6 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. CST
* Flexibly-paced assignments, lessons, and reflections
* Guest speakers and online meetings with community organizations

Students will be engaged in pre-college level academically stimulating and engaging activities designed to develop higher-level thinking skills. To be successful in these courses, a student should have a keen interest in the subject, be eager to work through academic challenges, and have a desire to learn in an online environment.  
   
Outside of live class sessions, students should expect to spend 2-3 hours (Fall, Spring, and Summer 9-week courses) per week engaged in independent course work. Our dedicated instructors will initiate and guide online lessons and discussions. Students should possess effective communication skills, including proficient reading and writing skills, and feel comfortable asking questions to guide their learning. The course syllabi will guide pacing, and instructional staff office hours are available to help students process content and stay on track.   
   
Online class sessions will occur at a consistent time throughout the course; see courselistings for class times. When attendance is not possible, students can access recordings of real-time class sessions any time after they occur.  
   
After each live class session, students will have the opportunity to provide short feedback so instructional staff and program administrators can monitor student progress and adjust teaching methods accordingly to meet the needs of diverse learners.

Course Access and Orientation

Schoology, the learning management system used by CTD, is a user-friendly platform designed specifically for K-12 online learners, and is COPPA compliant.

Students will receive login information to Schoology via e-mail 24-48 hours before the course start date.

With their login information, students will receive information about a live, online orientation for all new Online Program students. (Returning students are also welcome to repeat the orientation.) The orientation will be recorded for students to view at a later time, if desired.

Access to course material begins on the course start date.

Evaluations

All students receive a detailed evaluation after completion of the program. The evaluation provides feedback on the student’s achievements during the course and outlines areas for further growth. Evaluations are sent via e-mail and able to be accessed via MyCTD.

Technology Requirements

All course work and communication (including instructor contact information, the course syllabus, and assignments) take place within the Schoology course site. Schoology can be accessed on a desktop or laptop computer, or with the Schoology mobile app for iOS or Android tablets and phones. While tablets may be sufficient for most course work, some web tools and/or websites may require the use of a computer.

Students need access to a stable internet connection and updated web browser.

Participation in “live” course activities or multimedia recordings may require a computer web camera, microphone or headset.
