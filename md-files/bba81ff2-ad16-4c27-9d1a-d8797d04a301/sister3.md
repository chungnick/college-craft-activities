# Financial Aid

Options for Assessment and Academic Programs

## Financial Aid for Assessments

Fee waivers are not currently available for CTD assessments, but please e-mail our office at [ctd-admissions@northwestern.edu](mailto:ctd-admissions@northwestern.edu?subject=Assessment%20Payment%20Options) to discuss payment options.

A limited number of fee waivers is available from the College Board (SAT) and ACT for students who qualify for federally subsidized programs. Registrants may request financial aid during the test registration process with College Board or ACT. Applicants who indicate they are applying for financial aid will be asked to provide documentation of need.

## Financial Aid for Academic Programs

Need-based financial aid is available for most academic programs. Applications are reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis. Families are encouraged to apply early as the amount of aid available is limited and may be exhausted before the program’s financial aid application deadline.

Application deadlines vary by program. Check your desired program's web page for details. Please note that if you indicate you are applying for financial aid and pay the reduced tuition deposit, your course application will not be reviewed for enrollment until your FACTS financial aid application is also complete.  We are unable to hold a seat in the class while waiting for the FACTS application to be completed.

FACTS is a secure, online system used by many schools and organizations like CTD. All supporting materials (e.g., tax information, statement of need, etc.) must be included in the financial aid submission to the FACTS account in order for an application for financial aid to be considered complete. Incomplete applications are not reviewed. **If you are applying in the winter please do NOT wait for your current tax returns to be filed. For example, for winter applications, you may use your previous year's tax returns and W-2.**

The amount of financial aid awarded to families may vary from partial to full tuition, and awards are based on family income, family size, and circumstances (e.g., assets and liabilities, loss of a job, unexpected medical expenses, etc.). Most families awarded aid have a total household income of less than $65,000.

To be considered for financial aid, you must complete a program application first and then the FACTS CTD Financial Aid Application if you do not yet have one for the current academic year. The application confirmation email you receive will contain the FACTS application link. If you have a previous FACTS account with CTD you will still need to connect this year's application link to your FACTS account.  If you experience any difficulty in doing so, please review the FACTS [Frequently Asked Questions](https://online.factsmgt.com/platform/customer-service) web page or contact the FACTS helpline at 866/441-4637.

The amount of financial aid granted and the balance due will be reflected in your MyCTD account. Any outstanding balance must be paid before the start of the program. If you are unable to pay the balance and must withdraw from the course, you may be eligible to have the $65 application deposit refunded. 

Students are eligible for financial aid for one program/course per session.

## **Payment Plan Requests**

For in-person Summer Programs, the Civic Leadership Institute and 2-credit Online Programs, five-month payment plans are available. The in-person one-week programs offer a four-month payment plan.  **Payment plans started late will have an expedited payment line.** To apply, families must submit a completed a Summer Program Payment Planor Online Program Application form. (Available once applications open.) See the application form for submission deadlines and payment policies. The fee for using the payment plan is $50. Families that are eligible for financial aid will not be assessed the service charge for using the payment plan.
