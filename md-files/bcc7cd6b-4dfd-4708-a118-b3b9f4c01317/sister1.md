[Will you accept unofficial transcripts?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_content_7)

Yes, we accept unofficial transcripts, recognizing that each student's educational journey is unique. To ensure the authenticity of the transcripts and verify the existence of the school, we carefully review the provided documents. For students in home-school environments or those attending non-traditional education programs, we may request additional information on coursework to better understand your academic achievements. Our aim is to create an inclusive and supportive application process, and we appreciate your cooperation in providing the necessary details to ensure a thorough evaluation of your application.

[Is there an age requirement for the CSI program?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_content_11)

Yes, our program has a minimum age requirement of 16 years. While we do not impose an upper age limit, we assess each student's current educational situation to ensure that our program aligns with their goals for the future. Our intention is to create a learning environment that best supports each participant on their unique educational journey.

[Why does the CSI participant need a TB test?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_content_10)

**The TB Test requirment only applies to students participating in an on-site session. Participants in virtual sessions do not have a TB Test requirement.**

Stanford CSI is a clinically oriented internship and students may at times come in contact with patients during case studies (eg transplant patients on immune suppressant medications), standardized patients, clinicians and nurses, so it is important to know that they are healthy and do not have any communicable diseases, in particular tuberculosis. Documentation of a negative TB test (Mantoux or Quantiferon) within the preceding year is therefore required. If you have received the BCG tuberculosis vaccine, you will send need to send in a negative Quantiferon.

[What immunizations are required for accepted participants?](#main_panel_builder_panel_0_accordion_content_12)

**The below listed immunizations are only required for students participating in an on-site session. Participants in virtual sessions do not have an immunization requirement.**

Accepted applicants are required to provide a copy of the following immunizations with registration to attend CSI (**no exceptions**):

* One dose of TdaP within the last 10 years
* 3 Hepatitis B
* 2 Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)
* 2 Varicella (chicken pox) immunizations - or MD confirmation of illness, or laboratory evidence of illness (antibodies)
* Meningococcal vaccine at 16
* TB test - evidence of immunity within a year prior to start of the internship via PPD/Mantoux skin test or TB Quantiferon antibody test (is not altered by previous BCG vaccination). If the skin test is positive, either a negative chest Xray or negative Quantiferon or proof of treatment is required.

## During CSI Program Hours

[What time do classes start and end each day?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_3)

Our on campus summer session will run Monday through Friday from 8:45a to approximately 4p. During these hours, a variety of engaging activities are planned, creating a comprehensive and enriching program.

Our virtual summer session will run Monday through Friday from 8:45a to 2p.

Our fall intensive, classes are scheduled in the evening once a week for 10 weeks. Students should prioritize attendance for all 10 sessions, as consistent participation is a key factor in the success of the program. We believe that your active involvement will not only enhance your learning experience but also contribute to the overall success of the entire cohort. Your commitment is greatly valued, and we look forward to creating a rewarding educational journey together.

Attendance is taken at each session. Students that do not regularly attend sessions run the risk of not receiveing a certificate of completion for the course.

[How do students find out where their classes meet?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_2)

For the on-campus summer program, students will receive a comprehensive schedule in advance, detailing the exact locations of class meetings. The majority of class sessions will be held in and around the Stanford University School of Medicine buildings and learning spaces.

For our virtual learners, classes are conducted via Zoom. The access link will be conveniently available on the online learning platform and will also be communicated through email. We are committed to providing clear and organized communication to ensure a seamless learning experience for all participants.

[What time should students check-in on the first day of the program?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_1)

Accepted participants will receive a comprehensive email prior to the program start date, containing detailed information about the first day's schedule, including check-in procedures.

For summer programs, classes typically commence at approximately 8:45 a.m. Pacific Time, while the Fall Intensive is scheduled during evening hours. We prioritize providing timely and detailed information to ensure a smooth and well-organized start to the program for all participants.

[What is the extent of supervision that students receive?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_4)

All students enrolled in our program benefit from dedicated supervision by our program staff throughout program hours. Our commitment to a safe and enriching environment adheres to strict staff-to-student ratios set by Stanford's Protection of Minors policies. It's important to note that our program is designed for a mixed-age group, which may include both minor and adult students.

For the well-being of our participants, after-hours supervision is not available.

We take the safety and security of our students seriously. To learn more about Stanford's Protection of Minors policies, please visit [Stanford Protection of  Minors](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/protection-minors/protection-minors)administratiive guide.

[What happens if the student has a health issue while on campus?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_5)

In the event of a health issue while on campus, the safety and well-being of our students are our top priority. Our program staff is positioned nearby and is trained to assist promptly in any medical emergency that may arise during session hours. Additionally, we are in close proximity to Stanford Hospital and its Emergency Room, ensuring quick access to medical assistance.

All students participating in our program are required to show proof of health coverage, either individually or under their parent or guardian. Additionally, students under the age of 18 must provide a release for treatment. These measures are in place to ensure that our participants have access to the necessary medical resources and support throughout their time in the program.

In cases of non-emergency health issues, Stanford Express Care is available, along with several Urgent Care and Primary Care Clinics in the surrounding area. We remain dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for all participants.

[What if a student has an allergy or needs to take a certain medication?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_6)

We are committed to accommodating the specific health needs of our students to ensure a safe and inclusive environment. In the case of allergies or the need for certain medications, we make every effort to mitigate potential allergic reactions. Students are strongly encouraged to have ready access to their required medications at all times, and our program staff is readily available to facilitate this process.

To provide comprehensive care, we request that all students complete a Health Form, disclosing any allergies or current medications they may be taking. This information allows us to be proactive in addressing individual health needs and maintaining a secure and supportive environment throughout the program.

Your health and well-being are of utmost importance to us, and we appreciate your cooperation in providing this essential information.

[Who can parents contact with concerns while their students are on campus?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_7)

Parents or guardians with concerns while their students are on campus are encouraged to contact our Program Manager directly. Participants will be provided with the Program Manager's direct line ahead of the program start. We are dedicated to ensuring open communication and addressing any concerns promptly and professionally.

[How can students obtain a parking permit?](#main_panel_builder_1_panel_0_accordion_0_content_8)

There is limited parking available on campus. We recommend the monthly ‘C’ parking pass for any participants who do not have the option to bike or be dropped off each day.  'C' parking is available at the parking structure off of Welch and Stock Farm Road (parking structure 5). A more expensive 'A' parking pass allows you to park at Roth Way (parking structure 1).  For more information regarding parking, please visit the Parking & Transportation Services website at <https://transportation.stanford.edu/>.

For detailed information about the shuttle schedule, please visit [transportation.stanford.edu](https://transportation.stanford.edu/). We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to plan your transportation accordingly for a smooth and efficient experience.

## After the program has ended

[Do students receive grades or credits?](#main_panel_builder_2_panel_0_accordion_content_2)

No, the program does not award grades or credits as it is designed as a non-credit-bearing course. Our focus is on providing a valuable and immersive learning experience rather than an academic credit. Participants will, however, receive a certificate of completion at the end of the program to recognize their participation and successful engagement in the various learning activities.

[Do students receive a certificate at the end?](#main_panel_builder_2_panel_0_accordion_content_3)

Yes, participants will receive a certificate of completion on the last day of the program, acknowledging their successful participation. It's important to note that attendance throughout the entire program is a requirement for receiving the certificate. Exceptions for individual days may be made in case of illness or emergencies. We appreciate your commitment to the program and look forward to celebrating your achievements on the last day.

[What ways can students stay involved with CSI?](#main_panel_builder_2_panel_0_accordion_content_4)

We provide several avenues for students to stay involved with CSI and continue their engagement with our program. Participants are invited to apply as Program Manager Assistants, offering them the opportunity to contribute to the program in a staff capacity and further enhance their leadership skills.

Throughout the year, we offer various opportunities for students to share their program experiences through testimonials, and we may highlight their achievements on our social media platforms. We greatly value and appreciate hearing from former participants to learn about their current endeavors, and we encourage regular updates as they are willing to share. Your continued connection and involvement with the program contribute to the ongoing success and growth of our CSI community.

## Dress code, supplies, food

[Is a laptop computer required?](#main_panel_builder_4_panel_0_accordion_content_1)

For the virtual programs, reliable internet access and a device capable of accessing Zoom are essential requirements. We recommend that students choose a conducive learning environment to optimize their focus and participation in the virtual sessions.

For students attending the on-campus program, laptops are not required, although students are welcome to bring them or tablets if they prefer for notetaking purposes. While not mandatory, having a personal device can enhance the learning experience. Regardless of the program format, we strive to create an inclusive and adaptable learning environment to meet the needs of all participants.

[Will students need to purchase their own supplies?](#main_panel_builder_4_panel_0_accordion_content_2)

The program strives to ensure that all participants have the necessary supplies for a successful learning experience. For students located within the US, the program provides all required items. However, for international students, customs restrictions may prevent us from sending certain items, and students may be required to source these items independently. Rest assured, our program staff is committed to supporting and facilitating this process to ensure a seamless experience.

Additionally, virtual students are encouraged to acquire some recommended supplies, if possible. Most of these supplies are commonly found within households, and none are expensive or difficult to source. We understand the importance of access to resources and aim to create an inclusive learning environment for all participants.

[Is there a dress code?](#main_panel_builder_4_panel_0_accordion_content_3)

During program hours, a professional dress code is required as there will be interactions with physicians, patients, residents, and medical students. Attire such as jeans, T-shirts, tank tops, or cutoffs is not permitted. For summer sessions, there may be specific days when scrubs are required, and these will be provided by the program. However, fall students are not required to wear scrubs.

In addition to adhering to the dress code, students are expected to have their stethoscopes with them for all sessions. Notably, this item will be provided to participants. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a professional atmosphere and fostering a positive learning environment for all.

[Will lunch be provided?](#main_panel_builder_4_panel_0_accordion_content_4)

For students attending the on-campus session, lunch is provided Monday through Friday. This offering ensures that participants have a convenient and nourishing meal during their program hours.

For virtual summer students, an hour-long lunch break will be allocated, allowing them the flexibility to manage their lunch arrangements independently. We prioritize creating a comprehensive experience for all participants, whether on campus or virtually, and appreciate your understanding of the various arrangements to accommodate diverse learning environments.

[Are special diet options provided for lunch?](#main_panel_builder_4_panel_0_accordion_content_10)

We work directly with our vendors to try and accommodate all dietary requirements and needs for on-campus students. To ensure we can provide the best support, we kindly request that students share their specific dietary needs with us prior to the start of the session. Our goal is to create an inclusive environment where every participant can enjoy meals that align with their dietary preferences and requirements.
