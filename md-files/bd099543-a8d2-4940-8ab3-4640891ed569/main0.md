Applications open through May 22.

Please join us for the 2024 SMART summer outreach program! This free program is open to high school students who are interested in science and exploration. No previous experience required. The 4-day program will take place from 9:45 am to 4:00 pm on 7/12, 7/15 and 7/16, and noon to late evening on 7/13 for an off-campus visit. Field trips will depart from the University of Chicago campus and transportation will be provided. Students will need to provide their own transportation to the University of Chicago. The program is offered by faculty, staff, and students of the University of Chicago. For inquiries please contact Mrs. Maria Jimenez <[mdjimene@uchicago.edu](mailto:mdjimene@uchicago.edu)> or Dr. Cheng Chin <[cchin@uchicago.edu](mailto:cchin@uchicago.edu)>. Locations to be visited and content to be covered during the 2024 camp are outlined below. Download the schedule [here](/sites/default/files/SMART/smart2024/SMART2024_ScheduleFlyer_1.pdf).

#### **UChicago Campus**

* Witness the magic of *superconductivity* and learn about the *Meissner effect!*
* Explore engineering tools such as *3D printing,* including designing your own 3D printed objects!
* Join frontier *quantum science and engineering research* labs.

#### **Astro Day**

* Visit Adler planetarium to learn about astronomy and astrophysics!
* Observe the night sky from Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University if weather permits!

#### **Argonne National Lab**

* Visit the first U.S. national laboratory to explore large scale national research facilities and uncover the secrets of the *particle accelerator and Advanced Photon Source.*

#### **New Scheme of Levitation**

* Witness and participate in a real-time demonstration of magnetic, acoustic and thermal *levitation.*
* Investigate dynamics and interactions of particles in micro-gravity environment.

#### **Solar Cars and Renewable Energy**

* Build *solar cars* while learning about *renewable energy* and *electric vehicles!*
* Compete to build the most efficient solar car and win the race.

#### **Quantum Science and Engineering**

* Learn about the exciting new field of *quantum science*, including *quantum entanglement* and *quantum computing!*
* Participate in a hands-on *quantum physics experiment!*

Participants will enrich their understanding of STEM fields, explore important scientific concepts through unique demonstrations and hands-on experiments, gain exposure to diverse careers in the sciences, visit research labs and learn directly from UChicago scientists, and participate in trips to several leading scientific institutions including Argonne National Laboratory and Yerkes Observatory. Priority given to low-income or first-generation college students attending public schools on Chicago’s South Side.
