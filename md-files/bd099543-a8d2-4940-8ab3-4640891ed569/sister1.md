Science, Mathematics, And Research Training Program (July 16 - July 21, 2026)

Application for the 2026 SMART program is now open! The program is organized by about 20 researchers and educators at the University of Chicago. While details are still in development, we will have hands-on experiments, science tours, and more fun to explore together on the UChicago campus and in the city of Chicago. 10 to 15 positions will be available for students in grades 9–12.
