## Experience

Taking part in Summer@Brown on Brown University’s campus in the heart of Providence, RI allows you to experience what college life and learning is like on an Ivy League campus. You have the opportunity to engage in an experience that in many ways mirrors that of first-year undergraduate study at Brown immersed in Brown’s student-centered approach to learning.

## A Typical Day

You will be in class for three hours daily, five days a week – along with two- three additional hours of out-of-class work individually or with your classmates each day. Expect to be challenged and to engage with your instructor and fellow students through reciprocal inquiries, actively joining class discussions and group work as well as individual study. When and where you study is up to you. Summer@Brown provides you with the freedom and responsibility to determine when and how you will complete your out-of-class work while still engaging in Student Life activities, workshops and events taking place throughout each day. The program does not set your schedule, allowing students to begin to learn how best to manage their time in ways that will prepare you for your first year in college. No matter when your class meets – morning, early or late afternoon – you’ll have the opportunity to engage with students taking other courses through a variety of activities that help you grow as a student and as a person. See [Life Outside the Classroom](https://precollege.brown.edu/student-life) for more information.
