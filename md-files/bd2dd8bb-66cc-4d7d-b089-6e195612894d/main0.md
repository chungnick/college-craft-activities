# QuarkNet Program Information for High School Students

*"The search for truth is more precious than its possession."* --Albert Einstein (1879-1955)

QuarkNet is an educational program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) whose aim is to support science education in schools by establishing a nationwide network of science teachers. It provides opportunities for teachers to learn firsthand about cutting-edge physics research at universities and establish mentoring relationships with physicists at universities and national laboratories.

QuarkNet centers are connected to high-energy physics experiments operating at CERN in Switzerland, at Fermilab in Illinois, at SLAC in California, and others.

* Investigating particle physics through live, online data
* Learning fundamental physics, from energy and momentum to the structure of matter
* Collaborating with physicists, teachers, and students worldwide.
