## Hoya Summer High School Information Session Webinar

Wednesday, Nov. 19, 4–5 p.m. ET

---

Transform your dreams, ideas, and stories into organized, compelling, creative written works with dynamic lectures on craft topics, workshop sessions with graduate student instructors, and insightful, productive feedback from your peers. This combination of instructional approaches will help you generate a wealth of new poems, stories, and essays, and allow you to experiment with innovative forms in the field of creative writing. The Academy will also focus on the publishing and professionalization aspects of the industry, exploring what markets are available for your writing, what jobs are available to creative writers, undergraduate and graduate programs in writing, and how to get published.

Topics for discussion will include literary form and targeted craft points, often concerning social, political, and environmental themes. In addition, this week-long program will feature off-site excursions including an exercise in responsive writing at the National Gallery of Art and writing prompts at other locations around Washington, D.C.
