# Young Scholars Program-Reach

The Center for Neurotechnology (CNT) at the University of Washington sponsors a five day **“YSP-REACH”** program on the Seattle Campus during the summer. High school students receive an introduction to neuroscience and neural engineering, neuroethics, scientific communication, and the latest developments in brain-computer interfaces. Participants have the opportunity to tour CNT partner labs in departments including Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The goal is to provide students with exposure to the field of neural engineering and provide basic preparation for college studies in STEM subjects as well as future STEM careers. The program is well suited for any student interested in a STEM career, with a specific interest in neural engineering and neuroscience.

If the program will be held during the summer of 2026, the application will be available on this website in January or February 2026. The cost will be $500/student for the in-person program and $100/student for the virtual program.

Applicants MUST:

1. Be a high school student. (Graduating seniors can also apply.)
2. Attend all required lectures, seminars, focus groups, tours, class sessions and workshops.
3. Commit to full program participation. Participants will not receive academic credit.

**Questions?**Please [contact Dr. Eric Chudler](mailto:chudler@uw.edu), the CNT’s Education Director.
