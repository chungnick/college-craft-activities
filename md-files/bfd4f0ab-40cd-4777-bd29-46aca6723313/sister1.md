# Sci-High Program

### Applications for 2026 will be available in January.

### Please review eligibility below before applying.

The SciHigh Summer Program, organized by the Northwestern University George O'Brien Kidney Research Core Center (NUGoKidney), is dedicated to discovering and guiding highly motivated students who have a keen interest in science. The program offers valuable resources and learning opportunities to prepare students for future careers in the field of science and research.

Designed as a comprehensive immersive enrichment experience, the program aims to equip students with practical research skills and foster their self-assurance to excel in the realm of science and research. The centerpiece of this initiative is the research internship, where high school students actively contribute to projects under the expert guidance of experienced scientists and researchers. To ensure a fruitful and personalized experience, students are carefully matched with mentors and host labs that align with their unique skills, expectations, and aspirations

##### **The 2026 program dates are TBD.**

### [History](#)

In 2018, Northwestern University's NU GoKidney launched the SciHigh Summer Program, a 7-week paid internship initiated by the late Dr. William "Bill" Schnaper. Designed for rising juniors and seniors from Chicago high schools, the program aimed to build students’ skills and confidence in STEM. SciHigh offered hands-on learning and mentorship from scientists, physicians, and medical trainees. In 2019, Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey endowed the program, enabling it to nearly triple in size and expand its impact on aspiring young scientist.

### [Program details](#)

Each scholar in the program is matched with a Northwestern University faculty mentor based on shared research interests. Together, they develop a research project within the mentor’s area of expertise, which the scholar works on throughout the summer and presents at the program’s conclusion.

In addition to research, scholars participate in weekly workshops focused on research development, evaluation, and communication. These include hands-on and virtual sessions led by experts across STEMM fields.

The NUGoKidney program is based in the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in downtown Chicago.
