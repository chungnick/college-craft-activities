# U.S. Politics and Government: To Form a More Perfect Union

The U.S. political system is a dynamic mix of ideology and functioning governance. It is a nearly 250-year work in progress. Shaped by political policy, laws, and government regulations, the U.S. system adapts to realities on the ground and the choices made by political actors. What does the future hold? Will the government maintain democratic principles? How will it respond to topics like climate change, economic inequality, and racial justice? This course examines what Americans care about most and the questions that challenge our culture. Hear from politics and government experts from Georgetown, as well as former Chiefs of Staff for the Senate and the Speaker of the House.
