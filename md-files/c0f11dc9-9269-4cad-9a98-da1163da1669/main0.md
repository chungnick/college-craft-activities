DaVinci Camp

#### Summer Institute

A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

The DaVinci Camp Summer Institute is non-residential and consists of two, three and five-week all-day sessions that seamlessly integrate social and academic components from the arts and applied sciences. The program is designed to develop the interests and abilities of talented and highly motivated middle school and high school students (rising 6th – 12th grades and including graduating seniors).  

​

The camp activities blend mathematics, engineering, science, and art instruction in the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci’s concept of a Renaissance scholar.  Hands-on workshops and a mix of other activities reinforce instruction while balancing the students’ day.  Students engage their entire analytical and creative potentials in a fast-paced academic environment while meeting others who share their interests and abilities.  By having the camp at world-renowned academic institutions, we provide our students the opportunity to experience life on college campuses while getting to know Alumni from Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and Caltech who lead the program and expose students to the world of possibilities and opportunities that await them.

​

During the program, we emphasize the development of the child’s ability to think critically and work collaboratively with peers. Students learn the skills necessary to understand complex math expressions and to reduce them to their fundamental parts. They learn techniques that make them faster problem solvers. Course assignments include problems with varying degrees of complexity to ensure each participant’s success. Students are encouraged to have fun while learning and to especially learn while having fun.  DaVinci Camp engages the whole student and aims their imagination towards the discovery of their diverse talents.

The following represents a sample of previous years’ activities:​

* Visiting NASA JPL, NASA Ames Research Center and Lawrence Livermore National Labs
* Touring Caltech, Stanford, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco campuses and laboratories
* Learning at Archetype Press at ArtCenter College of Design and at the Getty Research Institute
* Visiting Dino Lab at the Natural History Museum and Chabot Observatory Star Party
* Attending performances by the SF Ballet and Opera, SF Symphony, and LA Philharmonic
* Learning Brazilian batucada along with salsa, samba and flamenco dancing
* Hiking in the Inyo National Forest and Devil’s Postpile National Monument
* Catching a Pageant of the Masters, Shakespeare and other theatrical performances

We invite you to join us for this year’s DaVinci Camp and we look forward to seeing you soon!

## Attendance Policy

DaVinci Camp Summer Institute’s expectation is that students WILL ATTEND EVERY DAY OF THE SESSION and WILL PARTICIPATE IN ALL SCHEDULED ACTIVITIES. Given our program’s fast-paced academic and social environments, even a partial absence makes it difficult to stay abreast. There are no make up days for activities missed. Students who incur absences will be dropped from the program without a refund.​

​

If there are special circumstances that will affect a student’s ability to attend every class meeting, please contact us in writing before applying.

Barring exceptional circumstances, students who anticipate missing more than 2 classes are not encouraged to attend the program.
