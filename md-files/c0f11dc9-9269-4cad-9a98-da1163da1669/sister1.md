## Need-based Financial Aid

FINANCIAL AID DEADLINE: MAY 5

Due to limited resources, DaVinci Camp Summer Institute only offers partial need-based financial aid to qualified students. To be considered for need-based funding, families must complete the FULL Application Process before requesting a financial aid application. The financial aid application must be submitted each year along with both parents' most recent Federal Tax Return and all schedules. An award in a previous year does not guarantee an award for subsequent years.  A complete Financial Aid Application and all supporting required documents must be submitted by May 5.

​

We will not consider applications for need-based financial aid after this deadline.

​

For additional information regarding need-based financial aid or to request an application, contact us at [faa@davinci-camp.com](mailto:faa@davinci-camp.com).

Please note that International students do not qualify for financial aid.
