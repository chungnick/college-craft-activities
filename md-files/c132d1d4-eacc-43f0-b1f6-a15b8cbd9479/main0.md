# AWS Foundation & Mₐ²JIC High School Internship Program

## Summer 2026 | High School Internship Program

The Mₐ²JIC Summer Internship Program is designed to engage high school students with a strong interest in **Welding Engineering**, including materials joining, manufacturing processes, and engineering design. This **paid, on-campus internship** provides an immersive research experience within the Manufacturing & Materials Joining Innovation Center (Mₐ²JIC) at The Ohio State University, where interns contribute to ongoing projects under the guidance of faculty, graduate researchers, and industry partners. The program is intended for students who are motivated to explore Welding Engineering as an academic and career pathway and who are eager to engage in hands-on, technically focused research.

## Why Choose Mₐ²JIC Summer Internship?

* Be apart of an industry funded research project, mentored by a University student and faculty. Discover how to be an active member of a research team where you will be immersed in a deeply rewarding experience
* Develop friendships and lifelong mentors to assist you with your future educational goals
* Gain scientific knowledge and skills (ethical, social and professional responsibilities) for your next step in your education.
* Opportunity to participate in lab tours and meet with our undergraduate advisor
* Our internship in research gives students a competitive edge when applying to college

Welding Engineering is a type of materials engineering that focuses on all aspects of creating a weld. You might have heard of welders using heat and pressure to fuse pieces of metal together, but welding engineers work on the design and application of the weld so that welders can manufacture them.  Watch the video to learn more:

## Eligibility Requirements

**To be eligible to apply to the Mₐ²JIC summer internship, applicants must be:**

* U.S. citizens or permanent residents
* Qualified students are typically rising juniors or seniors and have taken some coursework in STEM, have successfully completed laboratory science courses, and/or have participated in STEM extracurricular activities.
* Must live in the Columbus, Ohio surrounding area
* Have a strong interest in material science and welding engineering

## What You Will Learn

During the course of the summer, interns will conduct research in an engineering laboratory and depending on the assigned project, may also participate in data analysis coding, and modeling. While working in the lab students often assist with creating, testing and analyzing welding materials in order to help answer research questions.

Our interns will work directly on a research project and will present a “capstone” presentation and poster of their work at the end of the summer for the Welding Engineering program and guests.

## Internship Details

* The internship lasts approximately 8 weeks, starting when high schools are out for the summer - **early June through early August**
* Interns are expected to work up to 24 hours per week. This position is flexible and we can accommodate academic, sports or family obligations within reason
* Interns will be expected to create a research poster and present at the conclusion of this internship
* Paid internship, no transportation or room/board provided
* Parking is free
* Interns can submit their research poster to the [American Welding Society research poster competition](https://www.aws.org/community-and-events/conferences-and-events/posters-competition/). Winners receive an award and their research poster displayed at the Ohio State University and at largest metal fabricating industry trade show FABTECH convention.

## How to Apply

Internship applications are submitted through our **[Application Form](https://osu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4HGjTaotj4uWPoa)**. The application consists of short questions regarding contact information, two questions on your interest in engineering, and file upload for required documents. Interested students should submit a resume, unofficial transcript or list of STEM courses taken, a personal statement about why they are interested in this program, and a recommendation letter from an educator familiar with their STEM abilities. The application will not save your progress if you close it before submitting so it is best to prepare these documents before starting the application. There is a strict deadline for all applications so please refer to our Important Dates sidebar. Any questions or concerns can be directed to Heather Spisak at [spisak.13@osu.edu](mailto:spisak.13@osu.edu).
