# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a GPA requirement?**

We do not have a specific GPA requirement for the Mₐ²JIC Summer Internship Program. The most important part of a students application is there interest in engineering research and there commitment to the program.

**Will transportation be provided?**

Transportation will not be provided and interns are expected to arrange their own rides. Mₐ²JIC is located near several bus lines including [Ohio State’s CABS shuttle system](https://ttm.osu.edu/cabs) (including [CABS on demand](https://ttm.osu.edu/on-demand)), as well as COTA.

**What opportunities will I have after completing this program?**

The goal of the Mₐ²JIC Summer Internship Program is to introduce students to research in the field of Welding Engineering as well as Engineering in general. The discipline of Welding Engineering encompasses many different other engineering disciplines including chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. To learn more about our major in [Welding Engineering visit our website,](https://mse.osu.edu/undergraduate/major-welding-engineering) and to learn about employment after college [check out jobs in welding.](https://www.aws.org/Career-Resources/Career-Paths-in-Welding/Welding-Engineer/)

**What does a typical day look like for a Summer Intern?**

Interns typically work Monday through Thursday from 9:00 AM- 4:00 PM with an hour lunch, although shifts tend to be flexible depending on the availability of the student. Upon arrival students will meet with their assigned graduate mentor and complete lab safety training to be able work on their project throughout the shift. Most students have a large ongoing project throughout the 8-week program and maybe working on different parts of their project on a given day. The activities of interns may differ from week to week depending on the progress of the project and interns typically work one-on-one with their assigned graduate student.

**Will I get to choose my graduate mentor?**

At the start of the program, each student will be paired with a graduate student mentor. Mentor assignments are based on the student’s stated research interests and the availability of suitable projects.

**How does the academic internship differ from the summer internship?**

The academic internship typically meets only a few times each week and possibly works along with a program at your high school. For example, you may be required by your school to give a presentation on the research conducted at the internship. Due more time being dedicated to summer internship, it is a paid internship while the academic internship is not. However, both the summer and academic internships complete a lab safety trainings and a research poster and presentation under their mentor's guidance.
