## SAGE Camp

SAGE (Science Accelerating Growth and Engagement) is a one-week summer camp for Northern California high school students (age 14-17) hosted by [National Laboratory](https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories) scientists and engineers to share what life is like in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professions. 

This program aims to foster innovation, grow the STEM community, and engage intelligent, creative, and passionate young students in the everyday life of scientists and engineers. Throughout the week, students will participate in job shadowing, hands-on projects, professional development, and more! All students are welcome to apply!

### Goals for the camp

* To encourage college-bound students with a passion for discovery and innovation to become a part of the STEM community
* To show that STEM fields offer a diverse set of opportunities: you can balance your interests in artistic expression, historic research, and creative writing with application of your logical thinking, analytic skills, and computational ability.

### Learning outcomes for students

* Learn about the STEM community and experience what an everyday life of a scientist or engineer is like
* See how STEM allows you to explore and balance many interests
* Meet STEM professionals at various stages of their career as well as meet and connect with other students with similar interests to become a part of the SAGE-S community.

## SAGE Camp in Action

### Sponsors

This SAGE Journey program is a collaboration between multiple DOE National Labs. 

SAGE at Berkeley Lab is sponsored by Berkeley Lab Director Mike Witherell, Deputy Director for Research Carol Burns, and the Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation.
