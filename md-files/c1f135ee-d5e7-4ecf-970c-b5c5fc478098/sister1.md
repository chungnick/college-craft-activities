Trace evidence collection techniques (dusting for prints, shoe tread and type, document analysis, forensic entomology, etc.) will be combined with advanced criminal techniques (blood spatter analysis, black light technology, etc.) to help students work on a realistic crime scene in which students must piece together all the evidence towards the goal of cracking the case!

#### Psychological Sciences (YAP C)

NEW for YAP 2026!

Have you ever wondered why we think, feel, and behave the way we do? Get ready for a journey into the fascinating world of psychological science! In this week-long course, students will explore core area of psychology such as how the brain influences thoughts and emotions, the remarkable differences in people’s personality, and how people influence one another in social settings. Students will also explore how modern technology affects our thoughts, emotions, and behavior, and how developing a quiet mind may help counter some of the challenges of modern life. Through interactive activities, demonstrations, and applied exercises, students will investigate classic and contemporary questions in psychology. By the end of the course, students will understand foundational ideas in neuroscience, social, personality, and clinical psychology, and how to continue exploring psychology in high school and beyond!

#### Smash Chemistry (YAP C)

In this “smashing” course, students will get a closer (microscopic) look at the chemistry behind particle collision. When most people think about doing chemistry, they often picture a scientist mixing solutions, or heating things over a flame to cause them to react, but it turns out that another way to make molecules react is to dramatically crush them together! This type of chemistry is called Mechano-chemistry, where the application of mechanical force can be used to drive chemical reactions without adding heat or the use of toxic solvents, making it a more efficient way to create new materials. Students will learn how to “use the force” to make chemistry happen and will gain hands-on experience with the equipment used for carrying out and studying Mechanochemical reactions ranging from simple mechanical mills to advanced microscopes such as atomic force and confocal fluorescence microscopes that allow us to see how molecules change when we “put the hammer down.”

\*Must be at least 15 years old by 7/19/26 to attend this course.

#### VizKids: Digital Painting (YAP C)

NEW for YAP 2026!

Attention aspiring artists! This class introduces campers to the art of painting with pixels, where creativity meets technology and every brushstroke is just a Ctrl-Z away. Campers learn how traditional art principles like composition, color, light, and texture translate into the digital world while gaining hands-on experience painting with tablets and styluses. Using industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, and Krita, campers will experiment with layers, brushes, blending modes, and lighting techniques to turn blank screens into vibrant works of art. Emphasis is placed on creative exploration, iteration, and learning how digital artists build depth and mood one layer at a time. By the end of the camp, campers will export their skills into a fully rendered digital still-life painting of their own design that shows how technology can be used to make gallery-worthy “art”ifacts!
