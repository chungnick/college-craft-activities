# FAQs

### What are the ages of Vision participants?

Notre Dame Vision is for high school students, whether they are just entering high school, in the middle of high school, or are just graduating from high school.

### What are the departure and arrival times?

Check-in time is 2:00-4:30pm on Monday at Geddes Hall. Check-out time is after 12:30pm on Friday.

No. By registering for the program, you are agreeing to join us from Monday by 5:00pm to Friday at 12:30pm.

### Will the students be well chaperoned during the week?

Yes. Students will be closely chaperoned throughout the week. Our program employs and trains more than 60 Notre Dame undergraduate students who will serve as dorm chaperones and facilitators of the small groups. Dorms will be further supervised by dorm staff provided by the Office of Student Conduct. In addition, there will be a number of other adults leading the large group sessions who are affiliated with the program and will have a strong presence throughout the week. More information is available on the [Parent Information](/conferences/summer-institute/vision-youth-conference/parent-info/) page.

### If I previously attended Notre Dame Vision, can I attend this year?

Absolutely! Hundreds of young people have attended two, three, or even four conferences during their high school years...there is always more to explore! As a returning participant, you will share in a small group with other returning participants, allowing you to build on your previous experience and witness to your growth. You will also enjoy a new session offered only to returning participants. All returning participants are also required to submit an “Admission Essay” (this information is sent out every April). Finally, we ask if you are returning that you bring at least one new participant with you.

### How do I get to Notre Dame?

Notre Dame is located in Northern Indiana on the Michigan border. The campus is located 90 miles east of Chicago, accessible via the 80/90 toll road, Exit 77. South Bend is serviced by the South Bend International Airport, which also contains the South Shore Train Station and the Greyhound/United Limo main bus terminal. For a complete list of travel schedules, visit [www.sbnair.com](http://www.sbnair.com/). The South Bend (SBN) airport is 5 miles from campus. Students arriving by plane or train at this airport are advised to take a taxi to campus ($10–$16 each way). **If you plan on flying into Chicago airports:** The shuttle bus that ran between Chicago Airports and South Bend ceased operation in December 2019, but [American Airlines announced in 2025](https://www.southbendtribune.com/story/news/local/2025/07/22/american-airlines-adds-bus-service-south-bend-to-chicago-ohare-airports/85322179007/) that it will begin offering bus service for its passengers between South Bend and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.  *(Please note that there might be a stipulation regarding minors traveling alone.  We suggest you contact American Airlines directly for information.)* It is encouraged to fly into South Bend Airport.

Notre Dame Vision staff members are not permitted to transport students.

### Do you accept roommate requests for Notre Dame Vision?

Notre Dame Vision strives to honor participant roommate requests. Roommate requests may only be made at the time of submitting an application–changes are not permitted. If there are any discrepancies in roommate requests–e.g., conflicting or non-matching requests–the requests will be disregarded. Each participant may only request one roommate. There are a number of single rooms in each of the dorms as well.

### Is Notre Dame Vision for students considering a vocation to religious life?

While students may be discerning a religious vocation, Notre Dame Vision deals with vocation in the broad sense of the term - How is God calling us? How do our life choices reflect our Christian identity? We all have a vocation, and a variety of callings will be considered during the week.

### Is there something for adults at Notre Dame Vision?
