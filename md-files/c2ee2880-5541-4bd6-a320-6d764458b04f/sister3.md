# Vision for High School Students

## [**Register Here  (Registration for 2026 will open on January 16, 2026)**](https://campscui.active.com/orgs/NotreDameVision?orglink=camps-registration&e4q=52a2f949-24cf-4c48-8af8-ccc9951e49d7&e4p=23e97ce9-9195-429b-89b4-97996d9a17b7&e4ts=1737390783&e4c=active&e4e=snlvcmpscui00001load&e4rt=Safetynet&e4h=8963b59e42fd53f24c68ac8cc302d2d1)

### **God is calling. How will you answer?**

Each year, Vision conferences at the University of Notre Dame offer high school students from all across the world the opportunity to immerse themselves in the tradition and campus life of Notre Dame as they learn from the witness of the saints and develop practices to live their faith. For five days, sharpen your spiritual vision to recognize God’s grace at work in your life and immerse yourself in the Notre Dame campus. Sleep in the dorms, eat in the dining hall, and pray at the numerous sacred spaces across campus. 

Notre Dame Vision combines the theologically-rich experience of hearing nationally-known keynote speakers with the mentorship of college students. From large group sessions to small faith-sharing groups comprised of your peers, Notre Dame Vision gives you the space and the community to ask big questions about how God is calling you to use your talents in service to the Church and world.

> *Notre Dame Vision helped me realize that even though I’m not perfect God still loves me and will always love me. I started to understand how the Lord works in my everyday life. I saw what gifts he gave me, and now I can use these gifts to help others through the church. God made me, alive and wonderful, with all my passions to better this world!*
>
> **Susan**

> *Saying that Vision was extraordinary would be an understatement. From day one, I was introduced to people around me who not only shared my faith, but wanted to help me find God in things I never expected. I’m learning to accept how I have been gifted by God, and Vision has opened this gate for me.*

Theological Depth. Accompaniment. Prayer & Reflection. Lots of Fun.

What makes Notre Dame Vision unique among faith-based summer programs for high school students is the invitation to theological depth offered to young people as they are accompanied by undergraduate Mentors who receive robust theological and pastoral formation for their ministry.

These undergraduate Mentors cultivate a personal, authentic, and theologically sound small group experience for the high school participants as they come to know one another through the week as they share meals, pray, and recreate together while enjoying the beautiful campus of Notre Dame.

With this foundation, the Mentors and participants build the trust that is necessary to more openly and honestly explore the deeper questions of God’s call in their lives while listening to keynote speakers, participating in the sacraments, and building community throughout the week.

Grounded in the practices of prayer and reflection encountered at Vision, participants are sent forth fueled by the flame of God’s love to share their gifts with the world.

* Notre Dame Vision is open to students entering ninth grade through newly-graduated high school seniors.
* Come on your own, bring a friend, or register as part of a church or school group.

Campus and youth ministers, learn about Notre Dame Vision CYM, our [companion program](/conferences/summer-institute/vision-cym-conference/), designed especially for you.
