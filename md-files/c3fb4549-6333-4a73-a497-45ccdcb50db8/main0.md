# Summer Scholars Program

## Department Overview

Swarthmore is committed to expanding access to learning, no matter what type of educational background you have

The Swarthmore Summer Scholars Program (S3P) affirms our dedication to providing resources and support for all students. If you are the first in your family to attend college, come from a low-income background, or have experienced opportunity gaps or barriers, and have a self-described interest in STEM fields, our Summer Scholars Program could be a great match for you. All costs are covered for participants including books and necessary materials.

Applicants are limited to students who have been admitted to Swarthmore for the following fall.  This program is not for students who have not completed high school.

Many students are intellectually ready, but may be academically underprepared, for the rigors of education in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields. The goal of the Summer Scholars Program is to support you as you begin your studies at Swarthmore. This invitation-only, competitive-entry program provides sixteen students with a full academic immersion experience during four weeks of the summer preceding your first semester at Swarthmore, and one additional week during January of your first year at Swarthmore. If you participate in the Summer Scholars Program, you will acclimate more rapidly to college life, develop a familiarity with the type of coursework expected at Swarthmore, and form a supportive cohort of peers and professors before fall classes begin.

[Faculty](/summer-scholars-program/faculty-staff) who teach in the Summer Scholars Program will continue to work with you for the duration of your time at Swarthmore, in both formal and informal settings. You will be matched to a professor and receive mentoring during all four years of your academic career at the College. This extension of the program provides you with an invaluable opportunity to receive guidance specific to your individual background, areas of challenge, and plans for the future.

## Expanding Access

Providing access to students for whom college may be a novel culture goes hand-in-hand with making sure students feel at home at Swarthmore once they're here.
