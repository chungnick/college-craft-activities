# About the Program

The Summer Scholars Program opens doors for **admitted, domestic students** (students who will be attending Swarthmore in the fall as first year students) who are first in their family to attend college, come from a low-income background, or have experienced opportunity gaps or barriers, and have a self-described interest in STEM fields.  S3P combines vigorous academic preparation with significant mentor and peer support to prepare students to become leaders on campus and beyond. Sixteen students are selected to participate in this fully in-person 4-week summer program. There is no fee for this program; in fact, Scholars receive a stipend of $2,375 for their participation. After their first semester at Swarthmore, Scholars return to campus one week before the Spring semester to reflect on their first semester of college, prepare for spring courses, and engage with professional development and alumni networking.

* **Application deadline:** May 15, 2025
* **Program dates:** July 6 - August 2, 2025, and January 14 - 19, 2026
* **Cost:** Free
* **Benefits:** Scholars receive a $2,375 stipend for participation, a college-ready laptop computer, and ongoing mentorship and support throughout their time at Swarthmore

## Summer Scholars About

"This experience has made me really excited for the fall and to meet the rest of the people of Swarthmore. I know that when we come back to campus in the fall, we will walk in with a support group of students and professors that will be very advantageous, and it is thanks to the S3P program."   
- Summer Scholar, Class of 2022
