#### About Sustainable Futures Academy

The Rice Office of STEM Engagement offers a one-week, free, enrichment academy for high school girls that explores different engineering challenges focused on sustainability, with labs and Rice University faculty and graduate student discussions.

The Academy includes engineering landing capsules, roller coasters, learning about circuits through the use of Microbits, exploring motion concepts with the help of TI Nspire Rovers, and discussions of other physics concepts, their connection to engineering and the challenges of making more green and sustainable designs.
