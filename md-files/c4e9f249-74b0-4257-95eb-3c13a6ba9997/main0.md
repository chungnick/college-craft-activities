With choices of 3-, 6-, or 8-week sessions, most classes leave time for travel or a summer job.

During any of the summer sessions, you can benefit from small classes, really get to know your professors, and meet interesting people from around the world.

If you choose to stay on campus, summer in Ithaca is the perfect time to take advantage of the area's stunningly beautiful gorges, waterfalls, lakes, and parks. Hike, swim, sail, picnic, enjoy a sunset from Libe Slope, and check off #31 on the list of "161 Things Every Cornellian Should Do": Spend a summer here!
