## Summer Science Research Program

## 

## Applications for SSRP 2026 are closed.

### The Summer Science Research Program (SSRP) is a team-based mentored research program for high school juniors and seniors that takes place during the summer.

### **SSRP 2026: Program at a Glance**

* Monday, June 22 – Thursday, August 6, 2026
* Mentored hands-on laboratory research program where scientific questions are motivated by student interests
* Requires full-time attendance — approximately 35 hours per week during normal business hours
* Applicants must be current high school juniors or seniors
* Accepted students must be age 16+ at program start and must commit to attending the entire program. There are no exceptions to these rules.

##### 

---

### **Program Overview:**

SSRP Scholars will participate on a research team designed and guided by scientific trainees from the Tri-Institutions (Rockefeller, MSK, and WCMC). SSRP teams mirror the structure of a research laboratory, where there are 1-3 lead team leads who are supported by additional scientists. Each team will have their own space and resources in one of the dedicated RockEDU teaching laboratories. The SSRP experience is enhanced by relevant elective courses, guest lectures, workshops, networking opportunities, and social events.

---

### **Additional Details**

#### **SSRP Cohort Structure:**

Each summer, 32 students are accepted into the SSRP cohort. SSRP scholars are then divided into 4 research teams, each consisting of 8-10 scholars and  at least 3 dedicated research mentors.

#### **Research teams:**

The topics of each SSRP Research team are based on the expertise and scientific interests of the research team leaders. We attempt to match scholars to a team that aligns with their scientific interests. 

While the daily schedule of each team will be unique, the general weekly flow of the program is as follows:

* Week 1 Introduction to the team topic; getting familiar with research techniques and laboratory norms
* Week 2 SSRP Scholars choose a research question related to the team topic to explore
* Weeks 3- 5 Explore research questions guided by team leader and scientist-mentors
* Weeks 6 & 7 Analyze data and design a poster to present findings at the end of program symposium.

---

### **Application Process**

**Step 1:** Complete the online application. Applications are due on Friday, January 2, 2026 at 11:59pm Eastern Time. No exceptions will be made to accommodate late applications. Letters of Recommendation are due on Monday, January 5, 2026. The official online application to the SSRP [can be found here.](https://sopstudentapplication.rockefeller.edu/) 

**Step 2:** Selected SSRP applicants will be invited for an interview, to take place over Zoom. Interviews will take place during the month of March. The final cohort will be selected after the interview process is complete. We will share final decisions sometime in April.

---

### **Eligibility and Expectations**

To be eligible for SSRP participation, students must be enrolled as a junior or senior in high school, and must be at least 16 years old at the start of the program. In order to participate in the SSRP, students must commit to the entirety of the seven-week program — we can not accommodate attendance gaps. Please be aware: students are prohibited from using any aspect of work performed during the SSRP for science competition submissions.
