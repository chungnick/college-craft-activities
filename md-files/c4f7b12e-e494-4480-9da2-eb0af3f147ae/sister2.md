## SSRP Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the SSRP take place in person in 2026?

Yes! SSRP 2026 will occur on campus, in the RockEDU Science Outreach Laboratory at The Rockefeller University. 

### Is there a minimum age or grade level to attend?

Yes, students must be at least 16 years old by the start of the program (June 22, 2026). There are no exceptions to this rule. Students must also be currently enrolled as a junior or senior in high school at the time of their application. Current high school sophomores are NOT eligible to apply.

### How do I apply to SSRP?

All applications must be submitted through our online application system (OAS). A link to the OAS will be posted when applications open.

### When will applications open for SSRP 2026?

Applications opened Monday, October 13 and will remain open until 11:59pm EST on Friday, January 2, 2026. Letters of recommendation must be submitted by 11:59pm EST on Monday, January 5, 2026.

### Is it possible to apply after 11:59pm EST on Friday, January 2, 2026?

No. Late applications will not be accepted. RockEDU encourages students to submit their applications early to account for any technical issues that may occur. 

### Is there a fee to apply or participate?

No, there is no fee to apply, and the program itself is provided free-of-charge.

### Can RockEDU assist me with travel expenses?

Yes. We will provide SSRP students with an OMNY card to cover their travel to and from campus by NYC public transit for the duration of the program. Students who require additional assistance with other program related travel expenses (e.g. commuter rail such as NJ Transit) will have the opportunity to apply for a need-based stipend during the program.

### Can RockEDU provide or assist me with finding accommodations in NYC?

We are unable to assist students with obtaining accommodation in NYC. Consider seeking the advice of SSRP alumni.

### Are stipends available for SSRP students?

Stipends are not guaranteed, but may be awarded to students experiencing financial hardship, and who meet all the attendance and research requirements of the SSRP. Applications for stipends will be made available immediately after a student confirms their spot in the program and are due prior to the start of the program.

### Can students work with human patients through the SSRP?

No, SSRP students will not be able to work with human patients since minors are prohibited from doing so.

### Can students choose their SSRP research team?

A SSRP team preference survey will be administered prior to the start of the program. While students are not guaranteed placement into any specific team, we do our best to consider students’ interests.

### What is the time commitment?

Students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week in SSRP related activities taking place during normal business hours (~9am-5pm). During these hours, students are required to attend all mandatory sessions as outlined by RockEDU A syllabus will be shared on the first day of the program. 

### Are SSRP scholars expected to work outside of normal business hours?

Absolutely not. This is not encouraged nor allowed. 

### Can students start later or leave earlier than the SSRP’s official start and end dates?

No, if accepted into the program, students must commit on a full-time basis (9am-5pm, Monday-Friday) for the duration of the seven-week program. Students who cannot fulfill this commitment are not eligible for the SSRP.

### Can students apply to the program if they live outside the United States or outside of the Tri-State Area (NY, NJ, CT)?

Yes, students outside the Tri-State Area are encouraged to apply, however RockEDU cannot assist students with transportation, accommodations, or visa applications.

### When will students find out whether or not they’ve been accepted to the SSRP?

Applications will undergo an initial review to determine a subset of students to invite for virtual interviews. Students will be notified of whether they have moved on to the interview round by March. Interviews will take place in March. Students who have been interviewed will be notified of their final admissions status in late April.

### Are there any minimum GPA or curriculum requirements?

No. Students should show a sincere interest in science and desire to gain research skills and experience. We only ask for a transcript to confirm that applicants are enrolled in a high school. 

### Do I need to submit all application documents online?

Yes, all documents must be submitted online. While we allow students to upload unofficial transcripts as part of their application, we reserve the right to request official transcripts prior to the start of the program.

### Can I submit my SSRP research findings/poster/research report to a science fair?

The Rockefeller University and RockEDU do not permit the use of SSRP research findings for the purposes of participation in high school science competitions. Students who are looking to participate in competitions of this nature should not apply to SSRP.
