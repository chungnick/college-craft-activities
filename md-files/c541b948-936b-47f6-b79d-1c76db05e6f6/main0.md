## Program Schedule

Credit courses are taught by WashU instructors which may include faculty, graduate students, postdocs, and adjuncts from across campus disciplines and research fields. These courses are **undergraduate** courses offered by the College of Arts & Sciences and are open to pre-college, undergraduate, and visiting students. Introductory-level curriculum provides an opportunity for pre-college students to create a strong foundation for future undergraduate studies.

When offered during the regular school year, these courses are given over 16 weeks, so the pace during the summer is quite accelerated. Courses may include lectures, discussions, and group work. Students should expect any combination of daily assignments, readings, exams, quizzes, papers, and presentations. For every hour spent in class, students should expect at least two hours of work outside of class.

In-person courses meet Monday-Friday from 9:00-10:45am, 11:00am-12:45pm, or 1:00-2:45pm. Online courses are offered mostly asynchronously with some synchronous components including instructor office hours, learning activities and assessments.

When not in class, residential and commuter students have time to grab lunch, participate in independent or group study, and work on noncredit course work. Late afternoon and evenings are spent in optional enrichment activities and dinner. After dinner, community events provide students the opportunity to reflect and relax at the end of a busy day. Weekends are spent socializing with peers, studying, and exploring St. Louis.

## In-Person Courses

All of the courses listed below are offered in-person on the Danforth Campus.

### American Politics

In a polarized era of American politics, it is critical to have a working knowledge of the American political process and the analytical skills with which to interpret contemporary events. This course is designed to accomplish these dual objectives. In the first few weeks of the semester, we will explore both the key principles of social scientific thinking and trace the evolution of the fundamental characteristics of American government. We will use this foundation throughout the remainder of the semester to assess the contemporary challenges to American institutions and the context in which they, and the general public, make decisions. At the end of the course, students should be able to understand and critically engage with information about American politics, as well as actively engage with the American political system (should they choose to do so).

Prerequisites: none  
Times: MTuWThF, 1:00-2:45pm

### Ancient History: The Roman Empire

We remain fascinated by the events and people of the Roman Empire because they continue to affect the modern world in important ways. In this course we will discuss the social, political, and cultural transformations Rome imposed on the Mediterranean world from its first emperor, Augustus (d. 14 CE) to its last, Justinian I (d. 565 CE). Our focus will lie not only on the emperors and their deeds, but on the women who shaped the course of Roman history, the slaves and freedpersons who helped administer the state, and the diverse peoples who carried the weight of this power. We will analyze everyday life in the multiethnic empire, the gender dynamics of Roman society, and the religious transformations that affected Jews, Christians, Romans, and Greeks alike. Our class will focus on questions of power, diversity, tolerance, the meaning of "empire," and ultimately why Rome mattered and still matters so much.

Prerequisites: none  
Times: MTuWThF, 1:00-2:45pm

### Biology of the Brain

This course is for students who wish to learn about the biology of the nervous system, and the scientific process of understanding how it works. Biology of the Brain will include lecture, discussion, and analysis of cutting edge research, so active participation will be important. We will discuss the gross anatomy and cellular composition of the brain. We will analyze how the brain develops, changes with experience to create memories, and recovers from injury. Along the way, we will discuss nervous system dysfunction a range of contexts such as Addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Prerequisites: high school biology   
Times: MTuWThF, 1:00-2:45pm

### Biomedical Ethics

A critical examination, in light of contemporary moral disagreements and traditional ethical theories, of some of the moral issues arising out of medical practice and experimentation in our society. Issues that might be discussed include euthanasia, genetic engineering, organ transplants, medical malpractice, the allocation of medical resources, and the rights of the patient.

Prerequisites: none

Prerequisite: Calculus III  
Times: MTuWThF, 1:00-2:45pm

### Finite Mathematics

Topics from discrete mathematics will be explored with an emphasis on problem-solving and methods of proofs. Modules on counting; combinatorial tools; binomial coefficients and Pascal's triangle; Fibonacci numbers; combinatorial probability; integers, divisors and primes; and graphs will be covered as well as additional topics as time permits. Addressed mainly to college freshmen and sophomores; it would also be suitable to advanced high school students with an interest in mathematics.

Prerequisites: A good understanding of high school mathematics.   
Time: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

### Introduction to Cultural Anthropology

This course introduces the basic concepts, theories, and methods of Cultural Anthropology - an academic discipline that studies the diversity of human cultures and societies. The purpose is to provide a broad perspective on the types of research that anthropologists undertake, and to engage in a critical dialogue on how the work of anthropologists contributes to understanding the human condition. Introduction to Cultural Anthropology is a portal into more advanced anthropology courses.

Prerequisites: none   
Time: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

### Introduction to Microeconomics

Introductory microeconomics examines the behaviors of individuals and firms as they make decisions. Beginning with the foundations — the principles of economics, supply, demand, and the determination of prices and market equilibria — we'll progress to study how consumers make choices, how firms operate and compete ("the theory of production"), and how different market structures function. Other topics, such as externalities, taxes, international trade policies, welfare analysis, inequality, and other social issues, will be covered as time allows.

Prerequisites: none  
Time: MTuWThF, 9:00-10:45am

### Introduction to Psychology

A survey and analysis of concepts, theory, and research covering the areas of biological psychology, human development, learning, memory, social psychology, and mental disorders and their treatment. This is a general survey course designed to introduce students to the diversity of topics, research methods, and theories that comprise the study of mind and behavior.

Prerequisites: none   
Times: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

### Introduction to Statistics

Data collection: sampling and designing experiments. Data organization: data, tables, graphs, frequency distributions, numerical summarization of data, and consumer price index. Inference: elementary probability and hypothesis testing.

Prerequisites: none

Times: MTuWThF, 1:00-2:45pm

### Logic and Critical Analysis

This course is an introduction to first-order logic. Logic is the study of the formal properties of arguments. In this course, we learn how to make arguments precise by formalizing sentences and applying methods of deductive reasoning to prove conclusions. We also discuss the relations between logical reasoning and informal reasoning, and logic and rationality. Why study logic? Logic gives you principles and techniques to distinguish good forms of reasoning, helps you to construct correct arguments, and (to some extent) think orderly. Additionally, logic is essential in other fields that you might also be interested in studying (e.g., mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and analytic philosophy). And of course, logic is a fun and interesting subject in its own right. The course presumes no background in philosophy or logic.

Prerequisites: none  
Time: MTuWThF, 9:00-10:45am

### Matrix Algebra

An introductory course in linear algebra that focuses on Euclidean n-space, matrices and related computations.  Topics include: systems of linear equations, row reduction, matrix operations, determinants, linear independence, dimension, rank, change of basis, diagonalization, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, orthogonality, symmetric matrices, least square approximation, quadratic forms.  Introduction to abstract vector spaces.

Prerequisite: Calculus II (or AP Calculus BC)  
Time: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

### Public Speaking: Embodied Communication

The ability to speak well and to communicate effectively in the public forum is an essential skill for all students.  This course aims to offer a comprehensive and wide ranging approach to developing the skills of the contemporary speaker.  While acknowledging and utilizing traditional approaches to public speaking, this course will expand its reach to include applicable techniques from the world of the Performing Arts -- especially theatre and dance.  The course does not intend to train the student as a dancer or actor, but it maintains that the successful speaker would do well to harness some of the transferable skill sets from these disciplines.  The speaker, like the performer, must stand before an audience with an objective to communicate something well.  Both should be dedicated advocates for the message.  They share the common ground of requiring a strong voice for a sure delivery of the material, and an expressive physicality willing to fully embody and serve the message.

Prerequisites: none  
Time: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

### Religion and Film in America

This course attends to how religion, religious groups, and religious practices have been historically represented in the American popular culture, specifically, film. This course will consider film as more than simple entertainment. We will examine not only how in the United States film has functioned as a means to establish what counts as religion, but also how and with what results imaginations of religion in film helped and continue to help to construct normative conceptions of gender, race, and ethnicity.

Prerequisites: none  
Time: MTuWThF, 9:00-10:45am

### Social Problems and Social Issues

This course explores and analyzes contemporary American social problems and social issues using sociological tools. The sociological perspective provides the overarching framework for analyses of social issues, along with the application of sociological theory and research. Topics may include aging, alcoholism, drug abuse, crime, violence, poverty, discrimination, health care, family, globalization, and environmental degradation. This course will be valuable to students pursuing graduate work and careers in sociology, law, medicine and health care, and social services.

Prerequisites: none  
Times: MTuWThF, 11:00am-12:45pm

## Online Courses

These courses are offered online only. Online courses are offered mostly asynchronously with some synchronous components including instructor office hours, learning activities and assessments.

### Free Speech from Spinoza to Trump

Should hate speech be a criminal offense? Should it be illegal to burn the American flag? Should college students be allowed to write and say things that are offensive to their peers? Is it problematic for universities to prohibit on-campus protests that disrupt academic activities? Should social media companies censor false or harmful content on their platforms? This course will introduce students to contemporary issues of free speech, including hate speech, the freedom to protest, and social media regulation, and provide a survey of the philosophical and legal history of the principle of freedom of expression. We will study what Baruch Spinoza (1632 – 1677),John Locke (1632 – 1704), John Stuart Mill (1807 – 1873), and the United States Supreme Court have said about free speech over the years, before turning to contemporary debates about the validity and scope of free speech.

Prerequisite: none

### Introduction to Archaeology

Archaeology plays a critical and unique role in understanding the human past. Through study of the methods and theories of archaeology, and a survey of important firsts in the human past, this course introduces students to the way archaeologists use material culture to reconstruct and understand human behavior. Chronologically ordered case studies from around the globe are used to look at social, ecological, and cultural issues facing humans from the earliest times to the present. Students gain practice reconstructing the past through hands-on participation in two 1-hour labs focusing on lithics and animal bones. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to think critically about how the past is presented, and why, and the importance of the past as it relates to the present and future.

Prerequisites: none

### Introduction to Psychology

A survey and analysis of concepts, theory, and research covering the areas of biological psychology, human development, learning, memory, social psychology, and mental disorders and their treatment. This is a general survey course designed to introduce students to the diversity of topics, research methods, and theories that comprise the study of mind and behavior.

Prerequisites: none

### Introduction to Video Game Studies

This course will introduce students to multiple facets of video games as an art form, as a business, and as a part of American popular culture. The course will begin with a broad establishment of game studies and an investigation of the uniqueness of video games as a medium. Subsequent weeks will introduce different approaches to studying video games -- including historical, industrial, technological, cultural, theoretical, and aesthetic -- drawn from a variety of sources. Weekly lab sections will provide the opportunity for screenings -- including documentaries, news reports, television episodes, web series, and feature films -- and video game play. Students will complete a final research project on a video game of their choice and present on their projects in class.

Prerequisites: none

### Set in Stone? Monument, Memory, and Public History

The twentieth-first century has seen a radical reevaluation of public spaces worldwide. What and who is found in public spaces? Whose memory and history   
are on display? Whose experiences are absent or erased in these histories? Societies around the world have begun to confront these and many other critical   
questions about the history of their nations and how the past is portrayed and memorialized in everyday life. Monuments erected to celebrate past figures and events have, in this context, received closer scrutiny than ever before.

This course is designed to provide students with a historical perspective of the centrality of monuments and memory to nation-building. The course walks students through an analysis of recent actions to bring down statues/monuments. The course is divided into three parts, allowing for the scrutiny of the cultural importance of statues in the crafting of national memories, their place in public spaces, and the debate over their permanence after a society adopts a critical review of the past.

Prerequisites: none
