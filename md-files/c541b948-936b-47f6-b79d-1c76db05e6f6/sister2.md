## Scholarships, Fee Waivers, and Discount Information

### Need-based Scholarships

We offer need-based scholarship assistance for all of our programs. In order to be considered for a need-based scholarship, we must receive a completed application for scholarship assistance and supporting income documentation by the application deadline. For U.S. residents, this should be your parents' 2024 1040 tax return. Please note that our pre-college programs are not eligible for aid through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Scholarships are determined based on family finances. There are no income cut-offs for scholarship assistance; all are welcome to apply.

Scholarships do not cover travel to and from campus, personal expenses, or other expenses related to online coursework including computers or WiFi access. Scholarship awards are non-transferable between pre-college programs.

We do offer scholarship assistance for international students. International students applying for a scholarship need to provide official documentation, in English, of their parents' total yearly income. This can include a letter from your parents' employers or other official government documentation.

We reserve the right to request further documentation regarding family income, as needed.

#### How to Apply

When completing your program registration or application online, you will indicate your interest in applying for a scholarship and will then be automatically prompted to complete your scholarship application.

* *For Early College Scholars, Exploration Courses, High School Summer Kickstart, and Middle School Summer Challenge,* scholarship applications are reviewed as received and you will receive a response between 7-10 business days.
* *For High School Summer Launch, High School Summer Institutes and High School Summer Scholars Program*, scholarship applications are not reviewed on a rolling basis and there is no advantage to applying early. Scholarship decisions are released to admitted students along with admission decisions on April 8, 2026.

### Application Fee Waiver Request
