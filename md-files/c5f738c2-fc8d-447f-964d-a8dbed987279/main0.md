## Additional Program Options

### Academic & Test Prep

This four-week seminar series will begin in the second week of the Summer College 2 program. Led by experienced academic professionals, teachers, and test prep instructors from [Capital Educators](https://capitaleducators.com/), you’ll learn in small groups, where you’ll benefit from personalized attention. At the conclusion of the program, you’ll receive a detailed final report that highlights areas of your progress in different academic subjects, as well as customized suggestions for how to continue studying for the SAT/ACT. You’ll also receive a comprehensive manual, instructional flashcards, and a collection of official exams, which will offer continued support in the weeks leading up to the SAT and ACTs. Seminars will provide instruction in four main areas:

* **High School Foundations:** Review of critical content in Algebra I, Algebra II, and English grammar conventions
* **College Language Skills:** Dedicated time focused on analytical reading and essay writing
* **Recitation Blocks:** Focused attention and guidance to ensure students are making progress, meeting learning objectives, and staying on top of course material
* **Strategies and Techniques for the SAT and ACT**

To enroll in the Academic & Test Prep seminar, please use your NetID and password to [register](https://portal.scs.georgetown.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=63280849&showInternal=true) and pay the $900 fee.

### Summer Honors Intensive

If you’re seeking a more rigorous academic experience, you can take two courses per session, earning up to 12 total credits (a full semester at most universities). Students who complete two courses in a session will receive a Summer Honors Intensive Certificate upon completing their studies.

### Summer College 3 (Online)

Select college credit courses are available in an online format during the eight-week Summer College Online. Online courses feature the same content as our on-campus courses, but in an entirely virtual format.

### Seminars

Summer College students may enroll in optional, one-time academic seminars ($250 each), offered on two scheduled dates. These standalone workshops provide supplemental skill-building but do not include the multi-week seminar series and dedicated mentor support featured in the College Prep program. Students must be concurrently registered in a Summer College course.

#### **Introduction to the SAT & ACT Seminar**

This course covers test-taking strategies, time-management skills, and critical reading methods that are central to mastering the SAT and ACTs. Choose from one of two different sessions, where you’ll have the opportunity to take a full-length digital SAT or full-length paper ACT, after which you’ll receive an individualized, comprehensive analysis of your results. To enroll in the Introduction to the SAT & ACT Seminar, please use your NetID and password to [register](https://portal.scs.georgetown.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=6868413#courseSectionDetails_62216652) and pay the $250 fee.

#### **College Essay-Writing Seminar**

This 2-hour evening class will review the organization, content, and style of successful college essays. Offered twice during the summer, the seminar offers the opportunity for students to review sample essays, brainstorm for topics, develop a comprehensive outline, and write a complete college admissions essay that is thoroughly edited. To enroll in this seminar, please use your NetID and password to [register](https://portal.scs.georgetown.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=12410739) and pay the $250 fee.
