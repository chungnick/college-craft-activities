We offer summer camp programs for students in 6th through 12th grades. These summer camps are authentically Lyle, as the facilities, staff, and curriculum are all unique to the Lyle School of Engineering. Camps provide a creative environment for students to learn the fundamentals of engineering and STEM through hands-on, interactive team projects.
