## REHSS Program FAQ

* When can I find out more information about the 2026 program?

  Starting with our 2023 program, all students in the REHSS program must attend Stratford STEM, John Overton, or Hillsboro High School and be participating in the Interdisciplinary Science and Research Program. Students interested in participating should talk to their ISR scientist for more information.
* What should I expect as a REHSS Student?

  As a student in the REHSS program, you will be fully immersed in laboratory activities and research under the guidance of a mentor and research team. Students will work a standard 40-hour work week from approximately 9 am to 5 pm each day of the week (Times may vary depending on research lab and experiments). In addition, you will attend weekly workshops run by the REHSS program to supplement your lab education.  Lastly, you will present your research findings in an end-of-summer student research symposium open to the Vanderbilt community.
* What are the benefits of the REHSS program?

  The REHSS program is a highly selective research opportunity for college-bound students. The program will provide you with an authentic opportunity to see what high-level research looks like at a premier research institution. The program can be useful as you try to narrow down your interests and choose a career trajectory in college. The program also offers you a chance to impress college selection committees with your experience and your dedication to higher learning. Many past REHSS participants have published their research in scientific journals, presented their research at national conferences, and learned a great deal about both themselves and their scientific discipline as a result of participating in the program.
* What are the dates of the REHSS Program?

  The REHSS program for summer 2026 will run from May 26-July 2, 2025.
* Will I be paid for my time in the lab?

  No. At this time students are not paid a stipend for the time they work in the lab.
* Will room and board be provided?

  No. At this time room and board are not provided.
* Who do you look for as an applicant?

  The REHSS program is focused to provide students with meaningful exposure to authentic STEM research.  Students considered for this program will be those who have achieved excellent grades in math and science, who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing a career in a STEM field, and who can demonstrate that they have the maturity and interpersonal skills required to work in a professional science laboratory. Students must be at least 16 years of age at the start of the program.
