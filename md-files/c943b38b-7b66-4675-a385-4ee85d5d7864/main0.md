## Earn College Credit at Your High School

**Make your current courses count for more** Stony Brook's Accelerated College Education (ACE) program enables you to earn college credit on an official SBU transcript for courses you're already taking. No standardized tests are required!  **High schoolers who enroll in ACE can:**   * **Get a head start on college** * **Earn credits from New York's #1 public university** * **Save on future tuition costs** * **Enjoy a lighter college course load** * **Explore more electives and extracurriculars as a university student** * **Transfer earned Stony Brook credits to many other institutions**   Once you register for ACE, you'll start receiving college credit for your ongoing high school coursework. Your final grade in the class will be reflected on your SBU transcript. Unlike other methods of earning college credit in advance, ACE involves no big exams or projects outside of class. | | |

## **How It Works**

---

Courses at your high school are taught by approved teachers

Credits appear on an official Stony Brook University transcript

Credits are transferable to many other institutions (especially within SUNY)

**Frequently Asked Questions**   * How do ACE courses differ from AP courses? AP courses require students to take a high-stakes examination to earn a score from   the CollegeBoard. These scores may or may not be accepted by universities for credit.   ACE courses provide transcript credit through Stony Brook University and reflect the   overall grade received based on assignments and exams throughout the course. Some   high school classes may offer both AP and ACE options. * Is my high school part of the ACE program? If so, what courses are offered? View our [list of affiliated high schools](/commcms/ace/partnerships.php) to see if yours is among them. For more information on each course, refer to our   [ACE course list](/commcms/ace/courses.php). * How do I enroll in an ACE course? In order to be eligible for ACE enrollment, you must attend a school that participates   in the ACE program and be enrolled through your school in a course that has been approved   for ACE credit. You may then enroll by submitting the [online registration form](/commcms/ace/apply.php) and paying the non-refundable $300 program fee. * How do I get my grades and/or transcript? Your ACE courses and grades will be posted to your official Stony Brook University   transcript, which can be accessed through the SOLAR system. At the end of the academic   year, you'll receive a Stony Brook ID number that allows you to log into SOLAR and   request your transcript.  You can also request a copy of your transcript and submit transfer requests through   the [Registrar's office](/commcms/registrar/transcripts/ordertranscript.php#Transcripts).
