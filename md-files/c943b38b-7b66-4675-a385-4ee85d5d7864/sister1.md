# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Enrollment and Deadlines    * How do I enroll in an ACE course? In order to be eligible for ACE, you must attend a school that participates in the   program and be enrolled through your school in a course that is approved for ACE credit.   You may then register for ACE by submitting the [online form](/commcms/ace/apply.php) and paying the non-refundable $300 program fee. * When is the ACE registration deadline? ACE enrollment deadlines vary depending on whether the course is a fall, spring, or   full-year course. The upcoming registration deadline for Fall 2025 is Friday, October   24. * Can I drop an ACE course? Yes, during the registration window for that term, which will be posted on the [enrollment page](/commcms/ace/apply.php). Once that window closes, you can still withdraw within the next two months — but   you won’t be refunded for the program fee, and you’ll receive a W on your Stony Brook   transcript.  Contact [ACE@stonybrook.edu](mailto:ACE@stonybrook.edu) to start the withdrawal process.  **After December 12, 2025, you can no longer withdraw and the grade you earn will stand**.   Costs and Payment   * What is the cost of an ACE course? Each individual course is covered by a $300 non-refundable program fee. * Can I get a scholarship or grant to cover the program fee? No — the $300 ACE program fee is roughly 75% lower than the cost of a three-credit   course at Stony Brook. No additional discounts can be offered. * Can I still take the high school course even if I don’t want to pay for the credits? Yes, registration for ACE credits is optional. If you choose not to enroll for credit,   you can still take the class and benefit from the college-level curriculum. However,   you will not receive SBU transcript credit for the course. * Is the Program Fee tax deductible as an “education expense?” No. Program fees are not a deductible education expense.   Credit and Transcripts   * How many credits will I get for my ACE class? ACE courses range from 1 to 4 credits depending on the course. The program fee is   the same regardless of the number of credits. * Which colleges will accept ACE classes for transfer credit? The decision to accept transfer credit from Stony Brook University is at the discretion   of the receiving institution. Credits earned with a reported grade of "C" or better   in comparable programs are typically accepted by a broad range of colleges and universities   throughout the country.  Institutions and community colleges within the State University of New York System   (SUNY) system generally accept all transfer credits from Stony Brook University when   comparable courses are offered. A course that fulfills a particular General Education   requirement at SBU will also fulfill those requirements at any other SUNY institution.  **Our suggestions:**    + If there are institutions you are particularly interested in attending, contact the     admissions offices of the schools to inquire about the transfer of Stony Brook University     credits prior to enrolling in an ACE course.   + Save course syllabi in case the institution asks to reference them when deciding whether     to accept the transfer credit. * Can I use my credit if I choose to attend Stony Brook? Yes, the credit you receive from ACE courses is Stony Brook University credit and   will appear on your official Stony Brook transcript. * How do I get my grades and/or transcript? Your ACE courses and grades will be posted to your official Stony Brook University   transcript, which can be accessed through the SOLAR system. At the end of the academic   year, you'll receive a Stony Brook ID number that allows you to log into SOLAR and   request your transcript.  You can also request a copy of your transcript and submit transfer requests through   the [Registrar's office](/commcms/registrar/transcripts/ordertranscript.php#Transcripts). * When will my grades/transcript be ready? Grades are typically posted by early July. Once posted, they will appear on your transcript,   which will then be ready to send to the institutions of your choice. If your course   still reads as “In Progress” on your transcript, it is likely because the grades have   not yet been posted. * What is SOLAR? SOLAR is Stony Brook University's enterprise-wide, self-service system that provides   students with online access to manage their personal information. Students use SOLAR   to print schedules, update their contact information, and view transcripts.  Directions and credentials for accessing SOLAR as an ACE participant will be sent   to students at the end of the academic year.   Teaching for ACE   * I am a high school teacher and I would like to teach an ACE course. How can I do that? If you are interested in teaching an ACE course at your high school, contact [Laura.McMullin@stonybrook.edu](mailto:Laura.McMullin@stonybrook.edu).   Other Frequent Questions   * Do ACE courses require students to attend class on the Stony Brook campus? No, ACE courses are taught at your high school and by your high school’s faculty.   There is no need to commute to the Stony Brook campus. * How do ACE courses differ from AP courses? AP courses require students to take a high-stakes examination to earn a score from   the CollegeBoard. These scores may or may not be accepted by universities for credit.   ACE courses provide transcript credit through Stony Brook University and reflect the   overall grade received based on assignments and exams throughout the course. Some   high school classes may offer both AP and ACE options. * Why is my ACE/Stony Brook grade different from my high school grade? While high schools may offer A+ grades, Stony Brook operates on an A–F scale. For   more details, view the [Stony Brook undergraduate grading scale](https://catalog.stonybrook.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=81&hl=%22grading%22&returnto=search). * Is my high school part of the ACE program? If so, what courses are offered? View our [list of affiliated high schools](/commcms/ace/partnerships.php) to see if yours is among them. For more information on each course, refer to our   [ACE course list](/commcms/ace/courses.php). * Who do I contact if I have a question that isn’t addressed on this FAQ page?
