**Application instructions**

To apply to a VCU P.A.T.H.S. program, first create a VCU P.A.T.H.S. Profile. A Profile includes five sections: Contact info, Family info, Demographic info, Education and Activities and awards. All five sections are required and mandatory questions are marked with an \* asterisk. Each section can be updated and saved as you go!

After the Profile is complete, click on "Program application," then select "Check new program;" any open programs that you are eligible for will be visible. Make your program selection there.

Most program applications require a personal statement and one or more references. Just like the Profile sections, you can save your application and come back to it. Additionally, the personal statement can be saved as draft or submitted as final once you're ready for the committee to review it.

There is no "submit" button for the overall application. Applications are typically reviewed following the deadline once they are complete.  Complete applications require supplemental materials. Information about supplemental materials and mailing instructions are listed in the sections below. You can send recommendation requests, check the status of materials and see the names of files added all from your application!

**Supplemental materials**

Some programs require additional materials such as official transcripts and letters of recommendation.  In order for an application to be considered complete, all supplemental materials must be received in addition to the online portion. Check your [program page](/paths/programs/) to determine what items are required.

Supplemental materials must be official to counts toward completion. Physical materials must be mailed in their sealed, original envelopes directly from the source, or forwarded unopened by students.  **Digital documents are not accepted from students and parents and must come directly from the source.**

* Transcripts, if required, should come from current schools as well as any school where a degree has previously been conferred, or where the bulk of credits has been earned. Transcripts should be requested from the counselor or registrar's office.
* Letters of recommendation, if required, may come from any teacher, instructor, supervisor or individual unless specified otherwise, as long as the person is not a family member, (the exception being home-schooled students). You can have references upload their letters to your Profile by emailing them a link from your account.
* Test scores, if required, can be entered in the Education section of your Profile. VCU Acceleration is the only program that requires a copy of the actual test scores, and these may be submitted by email to [seekpathsapp@vcu.edu](mailto:seekpathsapp@vcu.edu) as an attached file or screenshot.
