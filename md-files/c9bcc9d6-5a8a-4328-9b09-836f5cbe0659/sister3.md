## Why become a VCU Ram?

#### A Culture of Care

We are committed to fostering a Culture of Care that embraces several core values that we have summarized as "CARE," our acronym for Compassion, Accessibility, Respect and Excellence.

#### Cutting-edge technology

We are at the forefront of digital dentistry technology, ensuring our students graduate with the skills to work in the most advanced practices.

#### Versatile city life

Richmond, VA offers a lot for a town its size. This medium-sized state capital on America's founding river offers vibrant city culture, an affordable cost of living and lots of outdoor adventures like day trips to beaches or mountains.

#### Clinic early, clinic ready

At the heart of our school is our robust fully specialized dental practice which provides our students unparalleled opportunities for learning and affordable, high-quality dental care to the Richmond community and surrounding areas.

#### Commitment to community

Collaborations with 15 community practices throughout the state provide unique service-based learning opportunities while local and international charitable partnerships provide care to communities in need.

#### Groundbreaking research

We are advancing oral health to improve society, from researching the mechanisms underlying cancer to testing new dental materials and technologies in the lab and clinic. Research is engrained throughout our school.

94% 1st time boards pass rate

*Approximately 94% of our D.D.S. students*  
*pass their clinical board exams on their first try.*

97% match rate

### Continuing education

The Office of Continuing Education provides an educational curriculum that actively engages the learner in acquiring new information and skills. Our faculty respond proactively to changing and advancing technology in dentistry by offering education programs which provide the skills needed to maintain and enhance clinical competency. Our office serves the public interest by providing educational opportunities for dental health care professionals which meet remediation requirements set by the Virginia Board of Dentistry.

Our online registration and payment website allows participants to manage their continuing education quickly and easily.
