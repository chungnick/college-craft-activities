# Life Sciences

**Applications for Winter and Spring 2026 are now open!**In collaboration with the Boz Institute, this program offers a distinctive research-based learning experience in the life sciences. Participants will engage in fieldwork and explore core topics in molecular biology, complemented by training in modern laboratory techniques, bioinformatics, and statistical analysis. Students will integrate foundational scientific knowledge with critical research skills, including literature review, hypothesis development, experimental design, sample collection and processing, data analysis, and scientific communication. The program culminates in a formal poster presentation, where students will showcase their research to local scientists and industry professionals.

## [FAQs](#)

[What are 90000 level pre-college units?](#Q1)[Are award of completion certificates available?](#certificates)  
[How do I request an official/unofficial transcript?](#Q2)[How do I access my grade report?](#gradereport)

**What are 90000 level pre-college units?**  
Courses numbered 90000-99999 are non-credit-bearing, pre-college-level courses designed to provide an opportunity for students to explore academic interests or prepare for college admission. Research Scholars pre-college units may be transferable for secondary school credit at the discretion of the receiving institution. Students should discuss the transferability of individual courses with the registrar of their secondary school prior to enrolling.

**Are award of completion certificates available?**Award of completion certificates are not available for the courses. However, students are welcome to request a transcript or downloand and print their grade report by logging in your MyExtension [here](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/ "https://myextension.ucsd.edu/").

**How do I request an official/unofficial transcript?**For instructions on how to order and pay for an **official/unofficial transcript**, please click [here.](https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts "https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts") If you’ve never ordered transcripts through Parchment before, you will need to register for a Parchment account. Details can be found from the link above.  All transcripts will be printed and delivered by one of the methods listed [here.](https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts "https://extension.ucsd.edu/student-resources/transcripts") Transcript requests are processed by Student Services. Should you have any questions, please contact them at [unex-reg@ucsd.edu](mailto:unex-reg@ucsd.edu "mailto:unex-reg@ucsd.edu").

Please note that when grades are not yet posted for the current term, you can still request an official transcript by selecting the "Hold for current quarter grades" option on the transcript request form, which instructs Student Services to wait to send the transcript until all current grades are officially posted to your academic record. This process ensures the transcript reflects your most up-to-date academic performance before it is sent to the requested recipient. 

You can also view/download your **grade report** by logging in your MyExtension [here](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/ "https://myextension.ucsd.edu/") without needing to make a payment. 

**How do I access my grade report?**  
Your final **grade reports** will be available in [MyExtension](https://myextension.ucsd.edu/) within three weeks after the last day of class. For current blended, hybrid or online courses, you can access grades for individual assignments through [Canvas](https://extensioncanvas.ucsd.edu/?_ga=2.192066856.349548968.1614007798-2003140809.1607358536) or by contacting your instructor.
