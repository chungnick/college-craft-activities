**Course Description:**

Climate change is a pressing issue, forcing organisms to contend with extreme temperatures and weather events. Without sufficient genetic diversity and/or phenotypic plasticity, populations may not be able to tolerate drastic environmental changes and subsequent ecological challenges such as limited dietary options. Predicting the survival outcomes requires understanding the complex relationships among relevant factors such as sex-specific metabolic rates and host-microbiota interactions. Laboratory-reared fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) have low genetic diversity, and female and male flies can be easily distinguished based on morphological features, making them an ideal model to identify sex-specific physiological adaptations under stress. In this 10-weeks hybrid research course that meets twice per week – once virtually, and once in-person (lab) program, students will maintain and differentiate female and male fruit flies and observe how their behaviors differ under various combinations of temperature and diet conditions. Students will also learn to extract DNA and RNA from fly tissues and analyze microbiome and gene expression data to identify sex-specific responses to environmental stressors.

This course will incorporate multiple research methods, including DNA extraction and quantification, metagenomic sequencing using nanopore technology, and behavioral assays. Students will work in small teams in the lab to discuss theoretical concepts and primary scientific literature, design experiments, perform research, analyze the data, and prepare scientific report. The course will conclude with a formal science seminar during which the students will present their work in person to a selected audience.

**By the end of the course, students will be able to:**

* Maintain and identify female and male fruit flies and microdissection their brains
* Develop testable scientific hypothesis and design a statistically relevant experimental design
* Critically assess primary scientific literature
* Become familiar with molecular biology concepts including DNA and RNA structure, transcription, and gene expression quantification
* Isolate and assess the quality of DNA
* Perform behavioral bioassays and generate data
* Utilize metagenomics sequencing (nanopore)
* Apply statistical methods to analyze differential gene expression
* Apply fundamental bioinformatics analysis to infer biological relevance of experimental exposures
* Designs a scientific poster and present their finding in a formal science seminar setting

**Course Topics:**

* Brain physiology
* Gene expression regulation
* Genotype vs phenotype
* Histones vs nucleosomes
* DNA vs RNA
* Central dogma
* Transcription
* Translation
* Experimental design concepts
* Biological vs technical replicates
* Negative vs positive controls
* DNA extraction steps
* Nanopore Sequencing
* Sex-specific behavior assessment
* Data management and statistical analysis un “R”

## Other Program Information

## [Course Requirements and Eligibility:](#)

This course does not require a textbook; however, a foundational understanding of basic biological concepts is essential for successful participation. No prior programming experience or advanced mathematical training is necessary. Students must have access to a personal computer capable of running free bioinformatics software and accessing publicly available data resources.

All course materials—including lectures, computer lab exercises, instructional videos, scientific manuscripts (PDFs), and datasets—will be provided through the Canvas learning management system.

This course will incorporate multiple research methods, including DNA extraction and quantification, metagenomic sequencing using nanopore technology, and behavioral assays. Students will work in small teams in the lab to discuss theoretical concepts and primary scientific literature, design experiments, perform research, analyze the data, and prepare scientific report. The course will conclude with a formal science seminar during which the students will present their work in person to a selected audience.

## [Cancellation/Refund Policies:](#)

* Students will receive a full refund for a cancellation or withdrawl from a course if this is requested 15 business days in advance of a course start date. Refunds are not granted for students who are dismissed from the program.

  You can drop courses online in a few easy steps:

  1. Log in to [MyExtension](http://myextension.ucsd.edu/).
  2. Navigate to "My Courses" and select the course you would like to drop.
  3. On the right side under "Tools" select "Drop Course."
  4. In the pop-up window that appears, select "Submit."

  Or submit a written drop request:

  + By fax: (858) 534-8527
  + In person at either [Student Services location](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/about-us/locations)
  + By email: unex-reg@ucsd.edu

  You may file a [petition](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/student-services/student-rights-responsibilities) for an exception to the refund policy if you are unable to continue enrollment for one of the following reasons:

  + Sudden serious personal illness, injury or hospitalization
  + The sudden serious illness, injury, hospitalization or death of a close member of your family
  + Compulsory military service
  + A documented administrative error that affected your enrollment
  + Extreme and unusual circumstances which were beyond your control

  Refunds will take approximately four to six weeks to process. Refunds are issued in the same method of payment (check or charge) of payment to the program.
