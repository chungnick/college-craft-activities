# Writing & Culture

### Are you ready to tell your story? Writing & Culture works to develop skilled, reflective, engaged storytellers who can share our stories well.

## Program Overview

The idea of the attic-bound creative is a myth. Regardless of the medium, **filmmakers and writers live their lives out in the world**, not hidden behind closed doors.

In this program, students explore writing, film, and culture through traditional, historical, and contemporary lenses on CMU’s campus and throughout Pittsburgh. Over the weeks, students will produce a body of work anchored in digital poetics and short-form writing, film development and production, and preparatory materials setting a strong foundation in the humanities.

**But this is not a Language Arts or Film Production course.**By participating in this program, students will learn to think critically, express thoughts creatively, and communicate effectively for college and beyond. They will build a diverse body of work, moving through a series of written and visual formats and culminating in a short film. In the course of developing their stories, students will explore the continuum of both written and visual communication.

## Curriculum

Writing & Culture is an intensive program that introduces students to the range of ways to tell a story. Guided by the mentorship and instruction of the Department of English’s highly distinguished faculty members, students will produce and develop story ideas across a variety of formats and will consider the ways in which the medium affects the message. A poem prompts a short story. A short story is translated into a visual presentation. Both are developed into a screenplay, a scene of which is filmed. Each form alters the way the story is told and understanding that process is our central concern. Thinking about the best way to convey the story you want to tell is a crucial aspect of the humanities and is central to the development of a strong foundation in any discipline. Over the course of this experience, students will gain a toolkit that allows them to interpret written and visual stories with fresh eyes and anticipate different viewpoints.

This program provides highly individualized feedback and guidance, drawing on each student’s personal strengths and interests. Through the breadth of experiences in this program, students gather concepts and ideas, using them to fuel their own body of work.

Classes, meetings, and enrichment activities are held Monday through Friday with occasional special events on weekends.

## Readings, Performances, and Discussions

Students attend productions through Pittsburgh’s world-class cultural scene to experience storytelling in its numerous forms and from varying perspectives. This includes readings and events with prominent local artists and authors, followed by discussion and analysis in a small group setting. These experiences broaden the way in which students read, understand, discuss, and produce written works and design elements.

## Exploration and Investigation

During the program, students tour exhibits and permanent collections at [Pittsburgh's many world-class museums.](https://carnegiemuseums.org/) They will also visit film locations and neighborhoods to explore the connection between words and visual settings. Considering Writing & Culture in a rich historical context across media, exploration often includes hands-on visits to the [Carnegie Mellon Archives](https://library.cmu.edu/distinctive-collections/university-archives) and [Fine & Rare Book Rooms](https://library.cmu.edu/distinctive-collections/special-collections), as well as events that explore book arts, film and filmmaking, and visual storytelling.

## Mentorship and Connections

Each student receives personal mentorship and discussion in a creative environment with distinguished faculty from Carnegie Mellon’s [Department of English](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/). Faculty include published creative writers, program directors, literary and cultural studies scholars, rhetoricians, and technologists at the cutting edge of digital humanities scholarship.

## College and Career Pathways

From talking with current students to gaining insights into career paths in English and related cross-disciplines, students regularly encounter college-level professional development opportunities. They also access guidance on college application essays and resume writing from Carnegie Mellon’s Writing & Communication faculty, staff, and students. Upon completion of the program, students may request a recommendation letter and are inducted into a growing Pre-College Writing & Culture alumni network that provides continued support for future endeavors.

## The Importance of Visual Media

'...visual media is extremely important,' Hinkleman said.  'We all carry devices in our pockets and we all receive information via a visual medium of some kind. It is how people communicate. It's embedded in everything that we do... We are constantly processing it, so we don't think about how visual media influences us or how it works. Yet this is the way most of us get our notions of our political ideas, how history works, and our ideas of what's appropriate or inappropriate culturally. It affects every aspect of our lives.' ~ [Program Director Jeffrey Hinkelman](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/2019-09/inside-film-video-collection-jeff-hinkelman)

## **Program Schedule**

Students learn and engage through several classroom courses and extracurricular activities. While many concepts are fluid across Department of English programs, Pre-College Writing & Culture has been sectioned by specific correlated themes and techniques.

### **CLASSES & WORKSHOPS: UNCOVERING AND COMPOSING YOUR STORIES**

## Creative Writing Across Media

Engaging in the craft of creative writing, students train their skills to connect individual writing to larger, significant messages, both personal and political. Topics are self-selected based on areas of personal interest and used to inspire poetic and short-form writing. Students have opportunities to learn and practice different presentation techniques for their works.

## Film and Visual Media

With a focus on film, students sharpen cultural analysis, critical writing, and interpretive skills. Film is not just cameras, actors, and directors, but a team of artists working together to bring to life stories which begin in written form. In this approach to studying film and visual media, students will engage in a variety of activities designed to develop skills connected to all aspects of visual media including performance, photography, and production design. In the final analysis, students will understand the ways in which multiple creative skills combine in an interdisciplinary way around film and culture.

## Creating Your Own Future in Humanities

Students discover different ways in which their passion for writing, film, and culture can leverage an English degree into a viable career. This culminates in students producing professional writing documents that can be used for jobs and college applications, such as resumes and college application essays.

## Testimonials

This experience was amazing and helped me grow not just in the area my program of choice covered, but also socially and as a person. I don't think I've ever met so many likeminded people as well as made so many friends at once. The faculty was also great, huge shoutout to Professor Jeffrey Hinkelman. ~ Karsten B., Writing & Culture 2024

I really thought the program was very well organized. My children have attended a total of four pre-college programs (that they themselves researched, picked, and applied), and I thought this program was the best one so far. ~ Anonymous (Parent), Writing & Culture 2025

The faculty and staff were incredibly engaged with the students. My daughter absolutely loved her program! ~Anonymous (Parent), Writing & Culture 2025
