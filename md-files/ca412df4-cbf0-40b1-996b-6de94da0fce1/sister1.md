## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much spending money will I need?**

On average, students can spend anywhere from $250-$350 during a six-week stay. This is dependent on what students want to purchase. Most meals per week are covered through the dining plan, but students will need spending money if they choose to eat off-campus. Students may also wish to purchase souvenirs at the bookstore or in nearby shopping areas.

Spending money is not required. However, if students choose to make purchases, they may want to bring spending money.

Typically, the best way to get cash to students is by sending them with an ATM card. There are PNC Bank and Citizens Bank ATMs conveniently located in Carnegie Mellon’s Cohon University Center.

Please Note: It is highly recommended that students do not bring large sums of cash. If students do have cash, we recommend that they always keep it with them or keep in under lock and key.  
  
**Will I have any other expenses while at Pre-College?**

Typical additional expenses may include:

* Any medical expenses not covered by insurance either from University Health Services or outside medical facilities
* Library fines for late or lost items
* Off-campus trip tickets
* Any school supplies that are not covered as part of the program cost
* Transportation from your home to campus and back
* Private music lessons

## **CMU Faculty and Staff**

**Did you know your high school-aged child can enroll in Pre-College Summer Session Program at 50% of the cost and that it doesn’t count toward the eight-term maximum for undergraduate students?**  
   
The university provides eligible full-time faculty and staff members with a 50% tuition benefit for dependent children who enroll in [Summer Session](https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/summer-session.html), a program offered through Carnegie Mellon's Pre-College Programs to rising juniors and seniors in high school. Summer Session classes award college credits but do not count as a term toward the eight-semester per child maximum for undergraduate tuition benefits. 

**All other Pre-College academic programs, besides the Summer Session program, are non-credit academic programs and are not eligible for tuition benefits.**

Find more information on tuition benefits, including eligibility requirements, on the HR tuition pages for [Staff Members](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/benefits/tuition/staff-children.html) and [Faculty Members](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/benefits/tuition/faculty-children.html).
