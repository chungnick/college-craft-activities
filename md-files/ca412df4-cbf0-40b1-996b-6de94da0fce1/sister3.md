## Pre-College 2026 Application FAQs

## Online Application and Program Choice

Within the online application, you will be asked to submit a combination of biographical, parent/guardian, and academic information. In addition, you may select two programs for application consideration listed in order of preference. Although a second choice program is not required, it is recommended.

Keep in mind that the order of your program preferences matter in our review process. Your first choice program preference should be labeled as such. All students will be initially considered for their first choice program preference. **If you are admitted or waitlisted to your first choice program, you will not be considered for your subsequent choice.** Applicants will only be admitted to one program.

Please note that as individual programs reach their enrollment and waitlist capacity, they will no longer be available as a program choice.

Your application will not be considered complete until we receive your Letter(s) of Recommendation. **Please plan ahead and request your recommendation letter(s) through our online application process in time for us to receive them by the appropriate application deadline.**

Once your application is submitted, you will receive email correspondence on how to access your applicant portal.

## Application Materials

#### **Letter(s) of Recommendation**

Your application will not be considered complete until we receive your Letter(s) of Recommendation. We cannot review your application until these letters have been uploaded into our online application.

Our Letter(s) of Recommendation process is entirely online. To request your Letter(s) of Recommendation within our online application, you will be required to enter your recommender's email address. Once this is entered, an email will be automatically sent to the recommender. They will be directed to an online portal where they will complete the recommendation form and submit their letter of recommendation.

In general, recommendation letters should be submitted by a counselor or teacher who can speak to your readiness to attend a pre-college program that includes college-level work, independent living, and cooperation in group situations.

**It is important that you plan ahead and request your recommendation letter(s) through our online application process in time for us to receive them by the appropriate application deadline.**

#### **Unofficial Transcript**

Your most recent unofficial transcript must be submitted with your online application. Transcripts must include your name and **all high school grades and courses you have completed**. Official transcripts (submitted via sealed envelope or directly from the school) are **NOT** required for our application.

#### **Standardized Test Scores**

##### **Optional for most programs. Required for Summer Academy for Math and Science only.**

Standardized tests scores are NOT required for application to most of our programs (excludes Summer Academy for Math and Science). However, you are welcome to submit your test scores if you feel they will strengthen your application submission. Please note that these test scores will be only one part of our holistic review process.

If you choose to submit your standardized tests scores, please upload the test score report of your most recent PSAT, SAT, PreACT or ACT.

#### **Essay Requirements**

Essay requirements vary by program. Please reference the academic program pages for more information. Essay prompts will be listed near the bottom of the program's page.

Responses to the essay prompts should be uploaded through the online application in a PDF or Word format.

#### **Supplemental Materials (if applicable)**

Depending on your program(s) of interest, supplemental materials (such as a video audition or images of your unique work) may be required to complete your application. Please reference the academic program pages for more information.

## Scholarships and Financial Documentation

Financial documentation is required when applying for scholarship consideration or to AI Scholars (AIS), CS Scholars (CSS), and/or Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS).

AIS, CSS, and SAMS have a holistic review where financial need is one of many factors considered. **Scholarships, however, require the demonstration of financial need.** Examples of financial need are (non-exclusive):

* Students who have received or are eligible to receive an ACT or SAT testing fee waiver.
* Students who are enrolled in or eligible to participate in the Federal Free or Reduced-Price Lunch program (FRPL).
* Students whose family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
* Students who are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
* Students whose family receives public assistance.
* Students who live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless.
* Students who are a ward of the state or an orphan.
* Students who can provide a supporting statement from a high school principal, high school counselor, financial aid officer, community advisor/leader or other official who can attest to the student's circumstances.

As verification/documentation of the financial status of the household, you will be asked to submit the household’s most recent Tax Form 1040(s) or a signed [NACAC Request for Admission Application Fee Waiver](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-feewaiver-fillable.pdf) form. This documentation will be required in order to complete your application for scholarship consideration or to AIS, CSS, and/or SAMS.

Only U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents are eligible for scholarship consideration or for participation in AIS, CSS, and SAMS.

Further information on program costs and scholarships is provided [here](../cost-financial-aid/index.html)*.* Please contact Carnegie Mellon’s Pre-College Programs at [precollege@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:precollege@andrew.cmu.edu) with any questions.

## International Applicants

#### **English Proficiency Requirements**

If your native language is not English, official results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) or its online equivalent (IELTS Online), the Duolingo English Test (DET), or the Cambridge English Assessment are required. Scores should be no more than two years old at the time of application.

**IELTS:** We require at least a 7.5 overall band score on either the paper-based or computer-delivered Academic Examination.

#### **International students currently studying in the U.S.**

If you are an international student who has attended a high school within the United States for a minimum of one year and plan to return to that high school after participation in Pre-College Programs, you are exempt from the English proficiency requirement. Your unofficial transcripts must clearly show your attendance at a high school in the United States for the one-year minimum.

## Commuter Applicants

We highly encourage students to participate in our residential program as it provides a more comprehensive college-life experience. However, you can still greatly benefit from our commuter programs.

To be eligible as a commuter student, **the student and parent/legal guardian** must have a **permanent residence within approximately 30 miles of campus or within Allegheny County.** Exceptions to this requirement will **NOT** be considered.

## Application Fee and Enrollment Deposit

#### **Application Fee**

A $50 application fee (non-refundable) is required to submit your application. This application fee is waived for applicants requesting scholarship consideration or if they are applying only to AI Scholars, CS Scholars, and/or Summer Academy for Math and Science.

If you select a program without scholarship consideration for one of your two program choices, the $50 application fee will be required.

#### **Enrollment Deposit and Enrollment Reply Form (if admitted)**

**Admitted students\*** will have 7 days to submit the $800 non-refundable enrollment deposit and the Enrollment Reply Form to secure their spot in the program.

**Admitted students receiving scholarships\*** will have 7 days to submit the $100 enrollment deposit and the Enrollment Reply Form to secure their spot in the program. These funds will be available for student use on campus through their CMU ID Card during the duration of the program.
