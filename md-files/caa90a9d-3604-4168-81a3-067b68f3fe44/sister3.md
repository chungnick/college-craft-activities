* **Pre-departure Advising**: at hand to support students with visa questions, what to bring, navigating airports, and other specifics to your trip.
* **Cultural immersion activities and excursions**: inspired by creating cultural awareness and sessions that introduce students to the City of Madison and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
* Peer mentorship and community-building events
* **Academic Workshops**: tailored to diverse learning backgrounds. We have the English in Action Workshop series to support students’ English language confidence.

Travel and visas

### Travel requirements and visas

The University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) have determined that summer programs offered by Badger Precollege serving precollege students at UW–Madison are programs that require a B-1 or B-2 visitor visa for any non-U.S. citizen or non-permanent resident.

The B-2 visa is for individuals traveling to the U.S. for: **Tourism, Visiting family or friends, Receiving medical treatment, or Participating in social or recreational events.** It does *not* permit employment or long-term study.

As of 2025, B-2 tourist visa applicants to the United States face stricter screening, higher fees, and earlier application deadlines. These updates are designed to improve security and reduce processing delays.

To qualify for a B-2 visa, applicants must:

1. Have a clear and temporary purpose for visiting.
2. Show financial ability to cover their trip.
3. Prove intent to return to their home country after the visit.

Application Process

1. Complete Form DS-160 online.
2. Pay the visa fee.
3. Schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate.
4. Attend the interview with appropriate documentation:
   1. Valid passport DS-160 confirmation page
   2. Visa fee receipt
   3. Supporting documents (e.g., travel itinerary, financial proof, ties to home country)

International student applicants are strongly encouraged to bring their program admission letter, among other supporting documents, to their visa interview at the U.S. Embassy. The process of obtaining visa and travel documents is the responsibility of the student applicant. The University of Wisconsin–Madison cannot advise students on visa procedures or eligibility. For more information about the application and required travel documents, view the [**B-1 or B-2 VISA Form**](https://precollege.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/obtaining-a-B1-B2-Visa.pdf), contact the Badger Precollege office or visit the [**U.S. State Department website**](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visitor.html).
