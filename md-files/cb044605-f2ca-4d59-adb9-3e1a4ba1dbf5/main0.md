Thanks to a partnership between the Chicago Public Schools and Northwestern University, we are pleased to admit 25 high school juniors from Chicago Public Schools to the College Bridge Program each summer. Students enroll in courses as part of the Northwestern Summer Session and students earn college credit for satisfactorily completed courses. Courses vary from three to ten weeks in length, and are offered online or on campus.

#### Program Highlights

* Tuition and textbooks are free, and you may choose from a wide variety of classes.
* Each student may enroll in one undergraduate course, for which you receive college credit.
* By taking college courses with Northwestern undergraduates, you'll have the opportunity to experience academic and social life on campus or online.
* You'll gain confidence, experience, and inspiration — a terrific head start for any student preparing for college.

### Application Requirements

#### To be considered for the College Bridge Program, you must:

* Be a current high school junior enrolled in Chicago Public Schools
* Have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale

#### Application Materials Checklist

* Personal Statement
* List of Extracurricular Activities
* Official High School Transcript

#### Application Deadline: April 1, 2025

Completed applications must be *received* by the deadline, including your official transcripts. Incomplete and late applications will not be considered. Your admission decision will be emailed to you approximately four to six weeks after the deadline.

#### Personal Statement

You will submit your 250- to 500-word personal statement as part of the online application in response to the question: *How would participating in the College Bridge Program help you meet your future academic goals?* You will be evaluated on quality of your writing, as well as thoughtfulness and specificity.

#### List of Extracurricular Activities

You should enumerate the clubs, sports, volunteer organizations, employment or other endeavors in which you participate within or outside of school. Please include your dates of involvement, a short description of the activity, and your role.

**Official transcripts** are required to be submitted as part of the application. E-transcripts submitted via secure electronic providers are accepted. Please consult with your school to see if they are part of a secure e-delivery network. Transcripts are not accepted by fax or personal email. Official transcripts may be sent via email to [cppadmissions@northwestern.edu](mailto:spsadmissions@northwestern.edu) and CC [collegebridge@northwestern.edu.](mailto:collegebridge@northwestern.edu)

#### College Bridge Orientation and Advising

If admitted to the program, you must attend the online College Bridge Orientation and Advising Session. This is a requirement in order to enroll in the program.

### Admitted College Bridge Students

#### Courses

College Bridge students are eligible to take almost any of the 100- and 200-level classes online, or on campus during Summer Session, subject to prerequisites and permissions. Please review any prerequisites indicated in the course descriptions. Three-week intensive science courses and 300-level courses may require special permission.

#### Adds, Drops, and Withdrawals

Students who have registered for a course through the College Bridge Program at Northwestern University are considered enrolled for the duration, and are expected to attend all sessions of the course for which they are registered. Excessive absences do not signal a student's intent to drop or withdraw, and is cause for failure in the course. Therefore, if you wish to change your registration in any way — by changing or dropping a course — you must do so through our office. If Summer Session has already begun, certain courses may not be available for course changes, and you may need to submit a Student Affairs Petition to withdraw from your course. If you need to change your schedule in any way, please contact our office.
