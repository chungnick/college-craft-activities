## WHAT IS **LEADERSHIP SCHOLARS**?

Leadership Scholars is a year-long program designed to help young people explore who they want to be and what they want to do after high school, by developing leadership skills core to post-secondary success. Nashers learn about different leadership styles, build confidence, resilience, and creative problem-solving skills, and apply them through facilitation, public speaking, and college and career exploration.

## **DURING THE PROGRAM NASHERS:**

* **Learn about different education and career pathways** and explore what makes a learning institution the right fit, analyze the challenges that marginalized groups face in higher education, and define a “good education” and how they can fight for their right to one!
* **Explore their goalsfor the future** by learning about the work of professionals, exploring the variety of options after high school, and networking with people in their field of interest. Nashers create long and short-term plans to make their dreams become a reality.

**What Do Nashers Say About It?**

### “Before, I didn’t even think about college. I didn’t think I wanted to go. Everything that followed can be linked back to Sadie Nash. Now my work leverages philanthropy in service of community and student voice. I’m working with public schools like the one I attended to integrate school-based mental health programs and social and emotional learning. It can’t get more full-circle than that.” — Nasher, Alum
