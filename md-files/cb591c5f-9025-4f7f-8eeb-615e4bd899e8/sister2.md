    the Spring 2025, Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters) and did not receive a Binghamton
    University bachelor's degree, apply for admission to Summer Session using the [Undergraduate Admissions Request for Re-Enrollment Form](/admissions/undergraduate/apply/current/#returning). You must be formally re-admitted to the University before registering for Summer
    Session courses; students will be readmitted to the school from which they most recently
    withdrew.
  + Admissions requirements include fulfilling [health requirements](/health/).

  Note: if you are studying abroad, participation in a Binghamton University or another
  SUNY study-abroad program does not require you to re-enroll. If you are participating

  you will be required to re-enroll.

    credits or becoming a non-matriculated student for a future term.

  Important things to know:

  + Acceptance to the Summer Session as a non-degree student in no way implies admission
    to the University in a degree program for future semesters.

    they attended.

  courses.
