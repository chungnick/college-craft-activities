# Student Info

## Academics

### Health Holds

If you have a health hold preventing registration, please follow the instructions
on the [Decker Student Health Services New Student Information page](/health/incoming-students/) to get your hold lifted.

### Credit Limits

* **Undergraduate students** may not register for more than 8 credits in either Term I or Term II. Students may
  not register for more than 16 credits during the combined terms of the entire Summer
  Session.
* **Graduate Students** are limited to a small number of overall credits. See the Graduate School Manual
  for details.

Exceptions to these credit limits are few and must be approved by an academic adviser
in the appropriate school for undergraduate students and by the Graduate School for
graduate students. All courses in the summer schedule of classes are offered for 4
credits unless otherwise noted. Full-time status for the entire Summer Session is
16 credits.

### Cancellation of Courses

Because of the regulations governing the Summer Session, courses that do not meet
the minimum enrollment targets are ordinarily canceled. The Summer Session Office
cannot guarantee that every course listed in the BU Brain schedule of classes will
actually be taught.

### Auditing a Course

Students may audit a course with the consent of the instructor, who determines the
requirements for participation by auditors. Students who take a course as an auditor
may not receive credit for it later unless they retake the course. A student must
file a Course Audit Petition--obtained from the Financial Aid and Student Records
Office--and be approved to audit any course. Completed audit forms must be submitted
to the Financial Aid and Student Records office by the add deadline for that specific
term of Summer Session. Auditors must follow regular Summer Session registration procedures
and make appropriate tuition and fee payment

### Student Complaint Policy

Students wishing to file a complaint should follow the procedures outlined in the
Academic Guide (Formerly Bulletin) under "Academic Grievance Procedures." Students
taking courses through a distance-learning format may also file a complaint with their
home state agency. The State Higher Education Executive Office (SHEEO) has provided
a directory of student complaint information by state and agency.

### General Policies and Procedures

For further details on general academic policies that may be relevant to you, **Undergraduate students** can refer to the [Office of the Provost Website](/academics/provost/undergrad/) and **Graduate students** can refer to the [Graduate School Manual](/grad-school/policies-and-procedures/manual/).
