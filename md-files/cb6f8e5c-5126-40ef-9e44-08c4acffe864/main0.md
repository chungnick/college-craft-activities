Welcome to BEAM Virtual!

At BEAM Virtual, we redefine online learning. Unlike any other online course, our program transcends the boundaries of traditional education. We don't just provide pre-recorded lectures; we offer an immersive journey into the realms of science, technology and medicine. Here, BEAM fellows do not merely absorb information; they engage, reflect, and question critically.

​

BEAM Virtual Fellows will learn about current research of distinguished faculty at UC Irvine virtually. Some of the past research project topics included:

 

Biomedical Engineering / Neurology / Micro Manufacturing / Drug Addiction

​

* Engagement Beyond Boundaries:

BEAM Virtual is more than just a virtual classroom; it's a vibrant community of highly motivated high school students passionate about exploration and discovery. While pre-recorded lectures lay the foundation, our program thrives on active participation, encouraging BEAM fellows to delve deep into their subjects, collaborate, and challenge the status quo.

​

* Reflective Learning:

We believe in the power of reflection. In BEAM Virtual, fellows don't just learn facts; they contemplate, analyze, and connect the dots. Through guided exercises and interactive discussions, our fellows develop a profound understanding of their fields, fostering intellectual growth and curiosity.

​

* Beyond the Curriculum:

In addition to delving into the cutting-edge research of distinguished UC Irvine faculty, BEAM Virtual focuses on holistic skill development:

​

Collaborative Group Settings:  
BEAM Virtual emphasizes collaborative learning. Fellows work together on multidisciplinary projects, honing teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal skills.

Effective Communication:  
We believe that ideas gain power through effective communication. Through presentations, debates, and discussions, fellows refine their communication skills, articulating thoughts with clarity and conviction.

Entrepreneurship and Innovation:  
BEAM Virtual doesn't just teach; it inspires innovation. Students are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs, fostering creativity and a spirit of innovation that goes beyond the boundaries of traditional education.

​

Join us at BEAM Virtual, where education is not a passive experience but an exhilarating journey of engagement, reflection, and critical questioning. Unleash your potential, challenge your intellect, and redefine your future with us.
