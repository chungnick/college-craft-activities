## GEAR UP

### About

A high school diploma and a college degree are all within your reach. Set realistic goals today and achieve your dreams tomorrow. We’ll show you how.

The mission of GEAR UP is to significantly increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.

GEAR UP is designed to enable more young Americans to stay in school, study hard and take the right courses to succeed in college. The aim is to help communities create new or expanded school programs and provide educational opportunities for students.

Additionally, GEAR UP prompts local schools, community-based organizations, private industry and institutions of higher education to work in partnerships to help students, and their parents, gain needed knowledge and bolster academic programs in their schools.

The UNLV GEAR UP program is funded 100% by grants (P334A210069 and P334A210066) from the U.S. Department of Education at a total cost of $30,415,700.
