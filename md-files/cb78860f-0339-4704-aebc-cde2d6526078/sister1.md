### GEAR UP

The mission of GEAR UP is to significantly increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in post-secondary education. GEAR UP is designed to enable more young Americans to stay in school, study hard, and take the right course to succeed in college. The aim is to help communities create new or expanded school programs and provide educational opportunities for students. Additionally, GEAR UP prompts local schools, community-based organizations, private industry, and institutions of higher education to work in partnerships to help students and their parents gain needed knowledge and bolster academic programs in their schools.
