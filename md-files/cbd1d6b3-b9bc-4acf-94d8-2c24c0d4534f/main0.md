# Discover Swarthmore Fly-In Program

Discover Swarthmore, held each fall, is our all-expenses-paid overnight fly-in program for high-achieving high school seniors. The Admissions Office pays for all transportation, meals, and on-campus housing expenses for students selected to attend one of these programs. Participants experience Swarthmore firsthand as they attend classes, stay with current students in our residence halls, eat in the dining hall, and go to campus events. Prospective students hear from faculty, staff, alumni, and current students through a series of panel discussions and informal conversations.

We will host two programs to give students maximum flexibility in visiting our campus during the busy fall semester.

* Thursday, September 25, 2025 - Saturday, September 27, 2025

  or
* Thursday, October 23, 2025 - Saturday, October 25, 2025

All applicants to Discover Swarthmore will also receive:

* $60 Application Fee Waiver should they choose to apply to Swarthmore for admission.
* The option to use their Discover Swarthmore essay to replace their Swarthmore College Short Answer on their application for admission.

All interested rising high school seniors (U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented/DACA students attending school in the United States) are welcome to apply to Discover Swarthmore, though preference will be given to students who are the first in their families to attend college, students from low-income backgrounds, and students who might not otherwise be able to afford a trip to campus.

## Nominations

Nominations for the Fall 2025 programs are now closed. Students do not have to be nominated in order to apply. Students who are not nominated are not at any disadvantage in our review process.

Nominations for the Fall 2026 program will open in February 2026.

## Applications

The application for the Fall 2025 programs are closed. The application for the Fall 2026 program will open in May 2026.

## Questions

Questions about the nomination and application process, or about the program itself, can be directed to [discover@swarthmore.edu](mailto:discover@swarthmore.edu).

## FAQs for Student Applicants

### What should I expect from a virtual Discover Swarthmore program?​​​​

In the case that Discover Swarthmore is held virtually, students should expect similar programming to the in-person experience, but in a virtual setting. Participants will use online webinar tools such as Zoom and Discord to interact with, and learn from, current students, professors, alumni, admissions deans, and Financial Aid staff. The program will highlight Swarthmore while offering participants useful information that we hope will aid in their college search and experience.

### What are the fall program dates for Discover Swarthmore?

We will host two programs to give you maximum flexibility in visiting our campus during the busy fall semester.

* Thursday, September 25, 2025 - Saturday, September 27, 2025

  or
* Thursday, October 23, 2025 - Saturday, October 25, 2025

### ​​​​​​Can I update my application with AP/IB/standardized test scores or senior course schedule?

Any updates or changes to your application after submission can be emailed to [discover@swarthmore.edu](mailto:discover@swarthmore.edu). We will make the necessary updates or additions to your application. No further information is required to apply to Discover Swarthmore beyond the Discover Swarthmore application and end-of-junior year transcript.

### Who can apply to Discover Swarthmore?

Discover Swarthmore is open to all interested rising high school seniors (U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented/DACA students living in the United States), though preference will be given to students who are the first in their families to attend college, students from low-income backgrounds, and students who might not otherwise be able to afford a trip to campus.

You must attend high school in the U.S. or its territories in order to be eligible to apply.

### When will I get my Discover Swarthmore decision, and how will I learn about my decision?

We expect to release Discover Swarthmore decisions in August. Students will be notified via email about their decision.

### If I’m not selected for Discover Swarthmore, does that mean I’m not a good fit for Swarthmore?

The application process for Discover Swarthmore is very competitive as we receive many more applications than we can admit to the program. However, just because a student is not invited to attend Discover Swarthmore does not mean they are not a good fit for Swarthmore. Many students who we could not invite to Discover Swarthmore apply for admissions and are accepted to the College.

### How do I submit my end-of-junior year transcript?

After submitting a Discover Swarthmore application, you will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours that includes log-in credentials for your Discover Swarthmore applicant portal. Here, you’ll be able to submit your end-of-junior year transcript. This transcript should include all final high school grades between 9th and 11th. We will accept a PDF copy of an official, unofficial, or self-report high school transcript. **Please note, you will not be able to upload your high school transcript until after May 15.**

### Do I need  to submit SAT/ACT scores on my Discover Swarthmore application?

SAT/ACT scores are not required in order to apply to Discover Swarthmore. Swarthmore is [test-optional](/admissions-aid/standardized-testing-policy) for the application process. Students who are unable to submit standardized test scores or who choose not to reveal their scores are not at any disadvantage in our review process.

### Do Discover Swarthmore participants receive a Swarthmore College interview?

Discover Swarthmore participants are offered an interview, which is conducted by current Swarthmore seniors. Interviews are a great opportunity to learn about Swarthmore from someone who knows it well. No need to wear a fancy suit or dress or provide a resume. Just come as you are and enjoy the conversations...and bring lots of questions. Admissions interviews will be available during Discover Swarthmore for students who have not interviewed already. [Interviews are not a required part of the application for admission](/admissions-aid/request-interview).

## FAQs for Nominators

### Do students have to be nominated in order to apply?

No, students do not have to be nominated in order to apply. The selection committee does not take into account whether or not a student is nominated.

### Can a parent or guardian attend Discover Swarthmore with a student?

On-campus programming for Discover Swarthmore is only open to students selected to attend.

### I am a high school counselor or community-based organization advisor. Does Swarthmore offer a counselor fly-in program?

Unfortunately, Swarthmore does not offer a counselor fly-in program. However, we do participate in a College Access Summit each summer that brings together area community-based organizations, high school counselors and area colleges and universities for a day of training, conversations, and panels about college access and equity. This program is limited to our region. We encourage you to visit our [Information for Counselors](/admissions-aid/information-counselors) page and take a look at our [Access and Aid Guide](/sites/default/files/assets/documents/admissions-aid/8.2024_Aid%20%26%20Access%20Guide_web.pdf).
