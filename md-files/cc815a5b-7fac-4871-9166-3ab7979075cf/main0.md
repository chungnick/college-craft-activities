#### Program Overview

**Start Date: June 15, 2026**

**End Date: July 24, 2026**

Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI) is one of the largest institutes in the nation that focuses on reproductive biology, women’s health, and infant health. Our High School Summer Internship Program provides students with the opportunity to participate in basic, translational, or clinical scientific research with the goal of stimulating interest in biomedical research as a potential career.

During the 6-week, 240-hour program (holidays included) each student will have the opportunity to work on their own research project under the guidance of an investigator and their staff at MWRI or Magee-Womens Hospital.

In addition, students will attend informal Lunch & Learn sessions, during which investigators will discuss biomedical science as a career from their personal perspectives and journeys in the field.

At the end of the program, students will present their research findings via a PowerPoint presentation to fellow summer interns, MWRI faculty and staff, and other invitees at the annual High School Internship Presentation Day.

The Institute includes basic, translational, and clinical faculty researchers from the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, as well as from other departments at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the Swanson School of Engineering.

Parking and Housing are not provided.

Students are eligible to receive a stipend of $1,800 for participating in this program if their household qualifies for the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program for Pennsylvania. The eligibility guidelines are based strictly on household income and can be found at [**https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/2013**](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/2013)**.** Once selected to participate in the program, students will be asked to declare their eligibility status and to provide proof of eligibility if applicable.
