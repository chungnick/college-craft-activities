# Engineering Summer Academy

##### Exploration of Engineering for Tomorrow's Innovators

The Engineering Summer Academy provides high school students the opportunity to dive into the exciting field of engineering through interactive, hands-on projects and real-world problem-solving. Designed for rising juniors and seniors, this immersive academy provides students with an introduction to variety of engineering disciplines offered at the Rutgers' School of Engineering, including aerospace, biochemical, biomedical, chemical, computer, civil, electrical, environmental, industrial and packaging, material science, mechanical, and systems engineering.

Throughout the week-long program, academy students will:

* Engage in hands-on, collaborative engineering projects
* Explore lab experiments and technology demonstrations in cutting-edge facilities
* Learn directly from expert Rutgers faculty, researchers, and student mentors
* Gain insights into engineering real-world applications and career paths
* Experience college life at a top-tier research university
* Compete in cardboard canoe races at the Sonny Werblin Recreation Center pool as an example of the engineering innovation process to design and build a vessel using cardboard, duct tape, and garbage bags!

Whether students are deeply invested in STEM or just beginning to explore their academic interests, the Engineering Summer Academy provides a dynamic, supportive environment to build new skills, connect with peers and mentors, and discover the varied and diverse paths within the exciting field of engineering.
