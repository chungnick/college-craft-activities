# Program and Tuition Costs

The program cost is determined by the academy of enrollment.

All pre-college academies are residential programs and include the cost of residential halls. Some academies include additional costs, depending on in-state or out-of-state resident status for academic credit, and also may include supplemental or materials fees.
