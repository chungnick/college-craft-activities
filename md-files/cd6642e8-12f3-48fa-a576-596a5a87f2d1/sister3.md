# Frequently Asked Questions

## Frequently Asked Questions

On this page

## General Information

Expand All

### What is the program cost?

Program costs can be found in the [Program Costs](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/admissions/program-costs) section of the website.

### Will participating in this program help me get into Columbia College?

Columbia University's Pre-College Programs are distinct from Columbia University's undergraduate school, Columbia College. Before applying to one of the high school programs, students should understand that their participation will have no influence on any ongoing or future application and admissions processes at Columbia College.

### Do I need a student visa to participate in the program as an international student?

Participation in the Pre-College Programs does not constitute the basis for securing a student visa. Students may enter the U.S. using the [Visitor (B) Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) or under the [Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) (if applicable) to participate in our program because the program comprises a short recreational course of study and is not for credit toward a degree or academic certification. Information on the U.S. Department of State’s policy on short periods of recreational study is [available here](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visitor.html). 

International students currently holding a F-1 visa may participate in the Pre-College Programs without needing to alter their visa status. F-1 students currently enrolled in a U.S. high school who will return to their school after the program are permitted to participate during their summer break. We recommend notifying your International Student Advisor or Designated School Official of your summer plans to ensure your school remains informed.

### Can I be a commuter student if I don't live in New York City?

Yes. All admitted students must provide documentation as part of the enrollment process that they will live at a residence that includes direct adult supervision in the form of family members or family friends who will live in the same residence. Students must attest that they will not take unsupervised housing in the form of hotel rooms, Airbnb rentals, hostels or other such accommodation. The required information will be requested via email in the weeks before the student's arrival.

### Is there a dress code?

The Pre-College Programs have no formal dress code. We recommend that students wear comfortable clothing.

### What do I receive upon completing the program?

Students who successfully complete the program receive official Columbia University Certification of Participation and an evaluation letter. The evaluation letter comments candidly and constructively on students’ performance, as demonstrated by their in-class participation and submitted work. Students are evaluated on the basis of the effort they put in, their progress over the duration of the class, and their potential for future work in the pertinent field and in college. Students may use these documents to demonstrate participation in the program. Additional documentation of participation is not provided.

### Can I use the Certificate of Particpation and Evaluation Letter in my college applications?

Students can ask their guidance counselors to add these two documents to their letter of recommendation. Please keep in mind that the Academic Year Weekend Program, NYC Summer, nor Online Summer programs are for credit. Misuse of these documents during the application process can result in delays to your undergraduate application decision and/or undergraduate course registration.

### What protocols are in place regarding COVID-19?

Pre-College students are not required to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination. However, we strongly recommend that students follow [CDC guidelines for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) vaccination which recommend that everyone be up to date with COVID-19 vaccines including booster doses.

Keep up to date with university communications related to COVID-19 [here](https://covid19.columbia.edu/university-communications).

### Are there information sessions available to learn more about the program?

Yes. For more information about upcoming information sessions, please visit the [Events](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/events) page.

### The Application Process

Expand All

### What are you looking for in an applicant?

The admissions committee seeks out academically exceptional students who are eager to contribute original ideas and a spirit of intellectual curiosity to a community of highly motivated learners.

Though there are no set minimum requirements such as a particular GPA, the application materials should establish that the student has the necessary academic background and level of ability, motivation, and maturity necessary for the program. Students must present evidence of the completion of any particular prerequisites identified in the individual program descriptions to be eligible to take courses with prerequisites.

### May I still be in the program if I am already a senior in high school?

Yes, the summer program is open to students applying during their senior year of high school for participation just after graduating.

### For the academic recommendation, may I identify a school administrator such as my principal, headmaster, or school counselor?

No. No substitutions are accepted for the letter of recommendation. The perspective of a teacher is valuable in making admissions decisions.

### What if my PSAT, SAT, or ACT scores are low?

We do not ask for these scores as part of the application.

### I took the program last year. Must I reapply?

Yes, returning students must reapply for admission. Please apply using the same application account and indicate that you are a past participant on the application. This will allow you to complete a shortened application. The $80 application fee will also be waived.

If a student previously participated in an online program, and they are now applying to an in-person program, they are now required to submit a school counselor recommendation from their school counselor, academic advisor, principal or headmaster.

### May I apply to more than one session or program?

**Multiple Sessions:**

* Students wishing to attend multiple sessions within one modality (e.g. commuter) may do so with one application. In the program of study page select your modality, session, and session dates.
* Students participating in multiple summer sessions pay an additional deposit for each session they plan to attend. If students drop a session the deposit will be forfeited.

**Multiple Programs:**

* Students interested in attending a combination of residential, commuter, or online sessions must first submit an on-campus application.
* Reach out to the Office of Admissions at hsp-apply [[at]] columbia [[dot]] edu for further instructions about submitting a second application for the online program.
* Students cannot participate in the NYC Summer or Online Summer programs and College Edge.

Please carefully review the possible session combinations to determine your desired program options.

### When will I be notified of an admissions decision?

It normally takes three to five weeks to receive a decision after all application materials have been received. Once a decision is rendered you will be notified via the email address on file.

### I am homeschooled, who is eligible to submit recommendation letters on my behalf?

The academic recommendation can come from the student's primary instructor. If the instructor is a parent or legal guardian, their email address must match the email address provided in the parent information section of the application.

### Are English language proficiency test scores required?

We do not require English language proficiency test scores; however, students should be completely fluent in English. Applicants who are not native English language speakers should objectively assess their English comprehension, writing, and speaking skills.

Our classes are academically rigorous and may require students to feel comfortable using technical and specialized vocabulary depending on the course. One of the core foundations of our program is class participation through active discussions, both in an online chat format and when called upon to speak in class. Students should be able to engage in classroom fast-paced discussions and read all materials and assignments without any translation assistance.

The rate for students enrolling in the NYC Residential Summer program is equal to 75% of the cost, excluding fees. Fees, such as those for activities, health services, technology, and specific courses do not qualify for the special rate. Program costs can be found in the [Program Costs](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/admissions/program-costs) section of the website.

Applicants can indicate their dependent status during the online application process. Once the admission offer is accepted and the student registers for class, the special rate will be applied directly to their account.

For additional information, please email hsp [[at]] columbia [[dot]] edu (hsp[at]columbia[dot]edu).

## Academics

Expand All

### How many classes can I take?

**Summer Program**

* Each student in the NYC Residential, Commuter, and Online Summer programs chooses just one curricular option in any given 3-week or 1-week session. Students may only register for two classes in the 2-Week Online Summer program. Please be advised that each additional course incurs an additional cost.

**Academic Year Weekend Program**

* While students may take up to four courses in the Academic Year Weekend program, we recommend between 1-3 courses per term at the most. Please be advised that each additional course incurs an additional cost.

### When do classes meet?

**Summer Programs:**

* Most curricular options meet for two hours each morning and two hours every afternoon, Monday through Friday, but there are exceptions; see [individual course pages](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/programs/explore-courses) for specific meeting times. Students are normally given a ten-minute break halfway through each class meeting.
* The hours between the morning and afternoon meetings are devoted to lunch, relaxation, use of the gym, and various co- and extracurricular activities.

**Academic Year Weekend**

* Courses for the Academic Year Weekend program meet for two hours at a time on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Classes are available in either morning (10 a.m. to 12 p.m., EST), afternoon (1 p.m. to 3 p.m., EST), or evening (8 p.m. to 10 p.m. EST) sessions.

### How demanding are the classes?

They are intended for bright, high-achieving high school students who are proficient in English and want to work hard, be challenged, and think independently. Students are not expected to master all the concepts to which they are exposed; they are evaluated on the basis of how much effort they put in and how much progress they make, not on whether they have understood all the material.

### What is the program’s approach to teaching and learning?

Classes are experiential and collaborative. While course instructors do provide substantive instruction, students learn largely by engaging directly with the subject matter through activities such as class discussions, debates, simulations, case studies, meetings with guest speakers, assigned readings, and individual and group projects. Participants are expected to participate actively in class and may be required to prepare in-class presentations.

Whenever possible, we try to take advantage of the resources of New York City and Columbia University by means of field trips, guest speakers, and the use of University facilities. See individual [course descriptions](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/programs/explore-courses) for details.

Students are encouraged to think independently, critically, and creatively. Instructors guide them in learning how to do so. Even more important than the particular knowledge participants gain in any of these classes is the ability to think with both open-mindedness and precision about complex and challenging material. We believe that this skill will be essential to them not only in their academic careers but also in their lives as world citizens and future leaders.

### What is the attendance policy?

Attendance is taken within the first fifteen minutes of class. For classes that meet twice daily, it is taken during both the morning and afternoon classes. Parents/guardians of commuter students should notify the Student Services Office of their child’s absences by sending a note in advance or by telephoning the Student Services Office at 212-853-7400. Parents/guardians of residential students will be contacted if their student is absent from class because of illness or another issue. The Pre-College Program staff will make every effort to keep parents informed; however, it is the responsibility of the parents to set attendance expectations with their students.   
  
Class attendance is critical to the successful completion of the program. Students who miss more than two classes for the three week and two week sessions and one class for the one week sessions will not be eligible for the program certification, and multiple absences will be noted in the evaluation letter. Students who are seeking an exception should reach out to the Student Services Office.

*For classes that meet twice a day, missing one class session is equivalent to missing one day of class.*

### How much homework is assigned?

While much of the required work in the program is done in class with instructor guidance, students should expect, on average, an hour or two of homework per night.

### How much do books and course materials cost?

For most curricular options, students should budget approximately $50 for expenses such as textbooks and field trip related costs. Some courses also require laptops or equipment that should be purchased before the start of class; these requirements are listed toward the bottom of the [pertinent course pages](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/programs/explore-courses).

### Who teaches the classes?

Classes are taught by scholars and practitioners who are experts in their fields, have a passion and demonstrated an aptitude for teaching, and have undergone background checks and University Protection of Minors training.

Instructor biographies appear at the bottom of each course page, though please note that (a) not all instructors listed for a course teach all sections of that course, (b) students cannot request particular instructors or sections, and (c) we occasionally have to make staffing changes because of availability issues.

### Are the classes for academic credit?

Courses in the NYC Summer, Online Summer, and Academic Year Weekend programs do not carry college credit. Upon successful completion, participants receive, in addition to an evaluation letter, a Columbia University Certification of Participation

Students seeking to earn college credit may be interested in our [College Edge programs](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/admissions/applying-college-edge), in which they can take undergraduate classes alongside college students.

### How are students evaluated?

Grades are not assigned. Rather, upon successful participation, students receive official Columbia University Certifications of Participation and evaluation letters from their instructors. Instructors comment candidly and constructively on students’ performance, as demonstrated by their in-class participation and submitted work. Students are evaluated on the basis of the effort they put in, their progress over the duration of the class, and their potential for future work in the pertinent field and in college.

### How fluent should I be in English to participate in this program?

Our classes are academically rigorous and may require students to feel comfortable using technical and specialized vocabulary depending on the course. One of the core foundations of our program is class participation through active discussions, both in an online chat format and when called upon to speak in class. Students should be able to engage in classroom fast-paced discussions and read all materials and assignments without any translation assistance.

### Online Learning Highlights

Expand All

### What kind of technology is required?

To successfully participate in your course and co-curricular activities, you will need:

**Computer**

A computer that is capable of running the latest versions of browsers, plug-ins, and recent software, including tools that will keep the system free of viruses and spyware.

Please be sure you have administrative permission to install Zoom and other technologies on your computer.

**Designated Learning Space**

Students should choose a well-lit, distraction-free learning space appropriate for interacting with faculty and fellow students on camera.

### What do I do if I have technical difficulties?

Prior to the start of the program and before each class, we recommend all students check to ensure they have a secure internet connection and that their webcam, headset, and microphone are all performing properly. If you experience a technical issue while attending class, you will be able to reach out to your Course Facilitator who will help troubleshoot the occurring issue.

### Is there a scheduled time I must log in for the class?

Students are expected to be in class by its scheduled start time. We advise students to log into their class 10 minutes before to ensure that their technology is running correctly.

### What activities are available outside of the classroom for online students?

The Summer Online and Academic Year Weekend programs offer co-curricular and College Life events and activities.

Co-curricular events are those meant to expand students' intellectual experiences. Such activities would include lectures on the college application process and special lectures on topics of current interest.

College Life activities are created and hosted by current college undergraduates. Student life events feature seminars and student clubs meant to introduce students to themes around college life and healthy community engagement.

Activities take place outside of class hours and are accessible by all students regardless of their class schedule.

Additional information can be found in the [Columbia Experience](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/columbia-experience) pages of the website.

### How is the program accommodating students who live in different time zones?

All courses are taught synchronously, which requires students to attend class during set meeting hours indicated on the individual course description page. All course times are Eastern Time.

**Courses in the Online Summer 2-Week Program are offered on one of two schedules:**

* 8:00 a.m.–11:00 a.m. ET

When selecting a curricular option, we encourage students to determine if the meeting hours of that particular course are feasible for the time zone in which the student lives. If the assigned meeting times of a particular course do not match well to the student's needs, we recommend students consider curricular options that may meet at a more convenient time.

Students are welcome to contact our Admissions Office for recommendations on similar curricular options by emailing hsp [[at]] columbia [[dot]] edu.

### No Early Arrivals

We must emphasize that early arrivals cannot be accommodated under any circumstances. All students must arrive precisely on their designated move-in/check-in date and time, which has been communicated to you via email.

If you find yourself arriving after the designated check-in hours, don't worry—we have a system in place to welcome you to campus. A dedicated phone number will be provided in your arrival information email for late check-ins. Please call this number as soon as you depart from the airport or train station to begin your journey to Columbia's campus. This advance notice is crucial as it allows our staff to prepare for your arrival and ensure someone is ready to assist you when you reach campus. By keeping us informed of your travel progress, we can better coordinate your late arrival and help you settle in smoothly, even outside of standard check-in hours. Your safety and successful arrival are important to us, so please remember to make that call when you're on your way

### Travel Safety

We strongly encourage students to travel to Columbia with a parent or guardian; however, we recognize that not every circumstance can allow accompaniment. For students who must travel to Columbia independently (without travel accompaniment from a parent or guardian), we strongly recommend the following:

* Create a physical folder of relevant documents for students to carry on their person while traveling. Documents should include:
  + A printed copy of your travel itinerary
  + A photocopy of all relevant photo identifications
  + A printed copy of your acceptance letter for this program
  + A printed copy of any previously secured ground transportation (if applicable)
  + *International students should also carry a copy of any relevant travel documents such as VISA paperwork, etc. (if applicable)*
* Discuss a travel communication plan
  + Who and when to contact at each leg of travel to ensure the student has safely arrived on time
  + Who and when to contact if a leg of travel has been delayed or canceled
  + How to access emergency travel funds if need arises
  + Note: not all airports have reliable and free Wi-Fi, so have a back-up plan in case Wi-Fi devices are not available for communication

### What is the difference between College Edge and the Summer Programs?

* College Edge is a credit, commuter, and in-person program for senior high students. Participants take undergraduate classes while still studying in high school. Watch [our pre-recorded webinar](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/admissions/applying-college-edge/college-edge-information-session) for further details.
* Summer program courses are created for high school students by [Columbia School of Professions Studies.](https://sps.columbia.edu/landing/sps-brand?utm_campaign=nn-fy26-brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=852936&utm_term=sps%20columbia&campaign_id=%7Bcampaignid&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22738913204&gbraid=0AAAAAphqpw8qKp5EDj9l2X6RY5Mmxg3C0&gclid=CjwKCAiA8vXIBhAtEiwAf3B-g4yD5F-lQWbKgXjpSxkusAFT4SzLMzE6xlXnpUGAlWecffKzaDPU1RoCD3oQAvD_BwE) These courses do not earn college credit and students receive a Certification of Participation and a personalized evaluation letter from their instructor.

### Will my credits transfer to my undergraduate institution?

The transferability of credits is determined by the institution receiving the credits, not the institution where the credits are earned. College Edge students should consult their intended undergraduate institution regarding the transfer of college credits.

Students may not receive more than 12 points of credit during the fall or spring semester. Students may not enroll in more than 6 credit points during a summer session.
