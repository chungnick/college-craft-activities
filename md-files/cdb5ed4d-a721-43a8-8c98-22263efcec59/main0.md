## Experiences in Research

### What is EinR?

Experiences in Research (EinR) is an internship program for high school students to gain hands-on experience with professionals at Berkeley Lab. Students spend six weeks over summer working directly on cutting edge projects alongside experts in STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) and STEM adjacent careers. Projects are focused around different aspects of STEM professions such as administration, science communication, data science, experimental research, and more. 

Students will be able to express their interests and project preferences in the application process to develop skills in their preferred field. Students will NOT be allowed to directly contact mentors during the application submission process. 

2026 internship projects will be hybrid or virtual depending on the office and scope of work.

### Who should Apply?

This program is for current 10th, 11th and 12th grade students enrolled in Northern California with experience in independent work. Due to logistics, we recommend that applicants live within a 20 mile radius of Berkeley Lab for hybrid and in person projects. However, we will review ALL applications regardless of location. Interns will be working approximately 30-35 hours a week over the course of six weeks. This is a paid internship program. Students will receive $500 per week. Applicants must be at least 16 years old by June 16, 2025. Students must meet BOTH age and grade requirements to be eligible. For students looking for more of an introduction to STEM fields, we recommend applying to the [Berkeley Lab Director's Apprenticeship Program](/programs/high-school/BLDAP). 

Internship dates are from June 15 - July 25, 2026.

Students attending schools in the Oakland Unified School District should complete the [ECCCO common application](https://app.grouptrail.com/public/externalForm/xrlDIizF40EX8dezne8XiYH2uRYkgWG4TSjLZG80) in addition to the EinR application. 

Please note: Students are only allowed to complete the program once. Former interns are not eligible to apply. 

### 2026 Application

* Student applications will open February 2nd, 2026. Check back for updates soon.
