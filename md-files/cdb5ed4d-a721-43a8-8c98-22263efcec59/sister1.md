## Application Information

### Eligibility

This program is targeted towards current sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in northern California high schools with some experience in independent work. Due to funding and logistics, we recommend this program for public high school students in Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco Counties. We also recommend that applicants live within a 20 mile radius of Berkeley Lab for hybrid and in person projects. Students that live further than 20 miles away should prioritize applying to virtual projects. ALL PARTICIPANTS must attend opening orientation and closing presentations. Regardless of grade, students MUST BE at least 16 by June 16, 2025 to participate and able to commute to the Berkeley Lab site a few days per week. ALL applications, regardless of distance, will be reviewed. 

Check out the [project descriptions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZcu45UjcBXGIrB6mrr1VERoOVK2udqvzwaW5uhXRhM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.42honvgqffbl) to get an idea of projects that may be of interest.

## Application Components

### Recommendations

Student applications must be accompanied by a recommendation by an educator, supervisor or mentor who can attest to the student's work ethic and potential to benefit from participating in Experiences in Research. Students will provide the name and contact information for their recommender in the application form, and should confirm beforehand that their chosen person is willing and able to provide the necessary information. 

Recommendations will be due March 28, 2025. However, they can be submitted at any time during the application process. We recommend that they are submitted as early as possible. 

### Application

[Apply via the linked form.](https://apply.mykaleidoscope.com/scholarships/LBNLSummerInternshipProgram2025) Student applications will open in early February 2025. Students attending schools in the Oakland Unified School District should complete the [ECCCO common application](https://app.grouptrail.com/public/externalForm/xrlDIizF40EX8dezne8XiYH2uRYkgWG4TSjLZG80) in addition to the EinR application.
