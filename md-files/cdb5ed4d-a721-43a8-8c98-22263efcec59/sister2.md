## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

Who can apply to Experiences in Research?

* This program is for sophomores,  juniors, and seniors (grades 10, 11, 12) enrolled in high schools in Northern California. Applicants must be at least 16 by June 16, 2025. 

  + Grade levels refer to the grade you are in at the time you are applying (i.e. the academic year before the summer you attend the program.) A student who attends the program between sophomore and junior year would still be considered a sophomore.
* Students are expected to commute to the Berkeley Lab main campus during their internship. Therefore, we prioritize counties that are close in geographic location which includes Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco school districts.  We recommend that applicants live within a 20 mile radius of Berkeley Lab for hybrid and in person projects. Students that live further than 20 miles away should prioritize virtual projects. All applications that are submitted will be reviewed. Participants MUST be able to attend the first day of orientation and closing ceremonies in person.
* Prospective students should be active in STEM activities/classes. We encourage having a GPA of at least 3.0. Proof of independent work and skills are highly valued.

What types of projects will students do?

* + We are hosting both STEM and STEM-adjacent projects in these general categories: administrative, communications, coding, data science, and experimental research. Applicants will be able to read through individual project overviews during the application process. Applications should highlight why students are they best fit for their chosen projects.

Can I reach out to mentors on projects that I am interested in? 

* NO. Students that email mentors outside of the application process will be disqualified from the selection process.

Who runs the program?

* + This program is hosted by the Government and Community Relations office's [K-12 STEM Education and Outreach team](/staff) at Berkeley Lab. We will be working with various scientists, engineers, staff and administrators at the Lab to develop projects and support mentorship activities.

Are the children of Berkeley Lab staff allowed to apply?

* Students with immediate family members working at Berkeley Lab are allowed to apply and will be considered, however, they are also encouraged to pursue external programs to leave space for students without an existing connection to the Lab and its resources. View our list of [external opportunities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ccT676RnCKqn9ShDyJMt-o35_kgBCxiYmIFagj5ClfY/edit?usp=sharing) to find other internship, job, and volunteer opportunities for students.

### For Students

If I miss the application deadline due to an emergency and/or technical issue, can I get an extension?

* No. Due to the high number of applications we receive, we cannot offer extensions on applications. Students must submit all materials by the stated deadline. Essays will not be accepted through email.

How much work am I expected to complete each week?

* Responsibilities and schedule will differ depending on your project, but expect to spend 30 hours per week on your internship work. This will include approximately 5-10 hours of meetings, workshops, and career talks each week. Approximately 20 hours each week will be spent on independent work and/or collaboration with project partners.

Do I have to attend all the sessions? 

* + Yes, please plan to attend all assigned meetings as assigned by your mentors and program coordinators to get the maximum benefit of the program.

Will I be able to participate in another internship, job, class or an extended vacation during my EinR internship?

* + No. You will be expected to be available consistently during work hours (9am-5pm) for mandatory events and meetings that align with your mentor's schedule. Participating in other activities that will block off significant portions of your schedule is prohibited. The program is only able to accept about 10% of applicants, therefore, we ask that accepted students take this opportunity very seriously. 

    - * Exceptions or accommodations may be made in cases where taking on other work is a necessity. Please reach out to the us at [fmdukes@lbl.gov](mailto:fmdukes@lbl.gov) and [abettale@lbl.gov](mailto:abettale@lbl.gov) , if this applies to you. (Interns will be paid $500 per week).

Will I be able to visit Berkeley Lab in person? 

* Yes. All interns are expected to attend our orientation, networking, and final presentation sessions in person (with the exception of students in Hawaii). However, projects may be either virtual or hybrid. Please review the project booklet to see each project's work status. Whether virtual or hybrid, all project materials will be provided to interns. Our team will coordinate shipping or pick up/drop off times when necessary.

Will I be able to meet other interns?

* Each project mentor will host a few (2-3) interns. We expect interns to work together and collaborate on all projects. In addition, the K-12 team will host professional development sessions and networking sessions for all interns.

Can I apply if I plan to temporarily move to or stay with relatives in the counties listed in eligibility criteria?

* No. In order to build strong and sustained relationships with students, we ask that all applicants reside and are enrolled in the school districts highlighted.

Are students reviewed/accepted on a rolling basis?

* No. All applications will be reviewed once the application portal closes. Students will be extended offers to interview beginning in mid to late April. We expect to make final decisions by early May.

Can I apply for a second internship if I have already participated in the program?

* No. Unfortunately, we have a limited number of spaces per year. In our efforts to support as many students as possible, we limit the program to one summer per student.

Is there an age requirement? 

* Students must be a minimum of 16 to take part of this program. We are not permitted to offer volunteer positions to ANY person that is not an employee of Berkeley Lab.
