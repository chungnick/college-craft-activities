# Pre-College Research Internship for Scholarship and Mentoring (PRISM)

The UAB Department of Surgery Pre-College Research Internship for Scholarship and Mentoring (PRISM) provides promising high school students who are interested in careers in healthcare and medicine with hands-on research experiences under the mentorship of surgeons and their peers. The internship provides students with the experience and knowledge that 1) allows them to explore medical careers, particularly in the field of surgery, 2) helps them understand the impact that research has in improving patient care and patient outcomes and 3) provides students with an experience that makes them more competitive for admission to college.

Five students are selected for the program annually. Over the eight-week experience, students will complete a mentored research project. Research projects often involve a team approach involving students at other levels, including undergraduate students and medical students. The experience also includes learning experiences, such as seminars and workshops, and supplemental activities, including clinical shadowing, to expose students to clinical practice and surgical careers.

### Program Overview

The program aims to provide high school students with an understanding and appreciation of the research process and how discoveries lead to improved patient care and patient outcomes. UAB surgeons, faculty and senior research staff mentor program participants. While research is the focus for the majority of the internship, students will also participate in clinical experiences. Students are required to present their research before the end of the program.

  **Program Focus and Requirements**

  *Would I have to develop my own research project?*  
   Students typically work on a team project with other students or help with ongoing projects. Students will work with their mentors and research teams at the beginning of the summer to define their research questions.

  *Will I be able to shadow a surgeon?*  
  Research is the primary focus of the program. The ability to shadow will be dependent on the restrictions at the time of the program and any restrictions/permissions are subject to change on an ongoing basis.
