* **Summer Research Program** - Participants will live the University of Nevada, Reno campus for one week and will participate in a virtual program for two or more weeks, attend daily classes (conducted in both English and Spanish) and created a student-led research project about a community health issue. SRs will learn to perform hypothesis-driven research, receive instruction and content in STEM and health care, toured a variety of research and health care facilities, and polish their communication and writing skills.
* **Near-Peer Mentoring**- Participants will be matched with a bilingual undergraduate (Leadership Trainee) to receive monthly mentoring during senior year.
* **Outreach Internship** - Participants will participate in a CBESS Outreach internship creating an initiative based on the summer research project.
