# Leadership Trainees (LT)

Undergraduate participants, or Leadership Trainees (LTs), will receive professional development in a variety of areas to prepare them to guide high school Student Researchers (SRs) through CBESS programming. Leadership Trainees will be provided intensive professional development workshops. They will gain experience and practice with inquiry-based instruction and strategies to engage the Student Researchers in STEM-health care content. In addition, LTs will receive training in the Responsible Conduct of Research and mentoring skills. Leadership Trainees practically will apply this knowledge by mentoring and guiding the SRs through the program. LTs will receive a stipend for their participation.

CBESS will select seven bilingual undergraduates to participate in the following programming:

* **Professional Development** - You will attend up to three full-day training sessions in, STEM Identity, Best Practices in Mentoring, Facilitation and Conflict Resolution, Inquiry-Based Instruction Methods, and CBESS Program Logistics. You will also complete responsible conduct of research training online (THOR). These trainings may take place in-person or virtually.
* **Career Exploration Events**- These will happen during the spring semester.
* **Summer Residential Research Program** - You will live on the University Of Nevada, Reno campus for one week, and will continue virtually for two more weeks. You will chaperone, teach and mentor high school participants.
* **Near-Peer Mentoring**- You will be assigned a group of high school mentees. You will engage them in group mentoring once a month upon their acceptance into the program. Individual mentoring sessions will take place monthly during their senior year (2024-2025) and will last about 1 hour. The sessions will occur via video chat.

LTs will receive up to $2,500 stipend for their participation in the program.

Eligibility of applicants is based on the following:

* Spanish-English bilingual
* Interested in STEM or health care careers
* Undergraduates taking either lower-division or upper-division STEM classes
* Mentoring / teaching experience (preferred)
* First generation students
* Studying in the College of Education, Science, Community Health, and Agriculture, Biotechnology, and Natural Resources, or Nevada INBRE Biomedical program
