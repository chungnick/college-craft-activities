# Leadership Institute

Transform your passion for social justice into action.

All over the world, youth are advocating for change both locally and globally. Through the Brown Leadership Institute, you’ll increase your understanding of complex social issues and your ability to advance social justice, no matter your current level of engagement.

There are two ways to participate in the Leadership Institute:

* two-weeks on-campus
* four-weeks online

Through both types of learning, you’ll meet students from around the world who are passionate about various issues, including civic engagement, gender equity, educational access and intercultural communication. You will spend your days delving into compelling topics in the course of your choosing, actively engaging with your peers and instructor. As you grapple with complex problems and brainstorm possible solutions together, you will practice a collaborative model of leadership, honing your skills in active listening, public speaking, problem-solving and teamwork. Building on this new knowledge, you’ll develop an Action Plan you can take home and apply in your school or community. (Wondering what an Action Plan looks like? View examples [here](https://precollege.brown.edu/action-plan-library).)

## Experience

On Campus

### **On Campus**

Your time outside of class is yours to manage. Residential students will be housed in Brown University residence halls with other Leadership Institute students to build a strong learning community. Students living on campus eat their meals in Brown’s dining halls. Students who commute to campus for their class will be able to swipe for one meal per day for the duration of their course.  All students enrolled in on campus courses have access to the University’s libraries, study centers and Writing Center. Leadership Institute students are typically assigned 2 to 3 hours of homework daily. Although your free time will be limited, you’ll also have the opportunity to engage with other pre-college students through various programs and activities that support your growth as a student and as a person. See [Life Outside the Classroom](https://precollege.brown.edu/student-life) for more information.

Online

Participating in the Leadership Institute online will involve learning both asynchronously (students complete coursework and participate in online discussions independently) and synchronously (students complete coursework and participate in live discussions). Your engagement includes reading and studying content independently **and**twice-weekly required live workshops with classmates and 1 on 1 meetings with your instructor. Throughout your online course, you have the opportunity to explore socially responsible leadership and work to develop a meaningful Action Plan. Studying online gives you the freedom to decide how and where you learn and entrusts you with the responsibility to manage your time effectively. With time to reflect, read and write, you can enhance important critical thinking skills. You also have the opportunity to strengthen your capacity for self-discipline and personal responsibility; skills necessary to excel in all learning environments. By taking an online class, you will become more comfortable with online learning – a format that is becoming increasingly important both in and out of school.

#### **A Typical Day**

Plan to spend a couple of hours each day **(approximately 15 to 20 hours per week) on various activities directly related**to the course you are taking.  Most days will include independent reading, engaging in written discussion sessions with classmates, watching a guest lecturer or a video from your instructor, or working on your Action Plan. Twice a week, your classmates will come together for required synchronous workshops. You will also meet virtually with instructors for one-on-one support and, throughout the course, engage with students in a cohort of learners committed to effecting positive change in their communities and the world.

Outside of your course, you have the opportunity to engage with pre-college students through various programs that support your growth as a student and as a person. See [Student Life: Your Virtual Community](https://precollege.brown.edu/student-life#virtual) for more information.
