| **Format** | **Number of Courses** | **Length** | **Program Cost - Online** | |
| Online | 2 courses | 7 weeks | $17,935 | |
| Online | 1 course | 7 weeks | $8,973 | |

\*The posted fee is for one course of the designated length. Each course carries its own course fee. If you enroll in multiple courses, you will be charged multiple course fees. Please Note: The course fee is calculated by the length of each individual course, not by the total length of time you will be on campus. For example: If you enroll in a 2-week course and a 1-week course, you will be charged the 2-week course fee and the 1-week course fee (not the 3-week course fee).

\*\*Residential fees for on-campus programs include meals, housing and access to the fitness/athletic/aquatics centers. (For the 5-week hybrid CRE, these services are provided for the three weeks you are on campus only as the first two weeks take place in the online space.) If you enroll in more than one course, and the courses overlap, and you plan to be residential, **you should not select the commuter option for either course, as the fees will adjust automatically; you will not be double-charged for the residential fees for the overlapping weeks.**

†A **commuter option** is available for Summer@Brown and Brown Leadership Institute students only. You will find the commuter option selection checkbox for each course you are enrolled in in your course cart. If you select this option (by checking the commuter option box) you will attend your course in-person and have access to on-campus resources and activities but **you will not be provided with a room assignment to live on the Brown campus.** Commuters will have access to one on-campus meal per day and access to the fitness/athletic/aquatics centers. The commuter fee is not optional for commuter students.

‡ If you enroll in a course taught exclusively online, your instruction and activities for that course will all take place online; no component of the program will take place on the Brown campus. Please be sure to check your enrolled course description to ensure that the method of instruction is what you are expecting.

##### **Important notes about health insurance coverage:**

* If you are an international student, you will automatically be enrolled in Brown’s limited coverage accident insurance plan for the duration of your program; this is not optional. An additional fee of $80 for this coverage (regardless of program length) will be added to your student account when you enroll in a course.
* If you are a U.S. student without health insurance, you will be enrolled in Brown’s limited coverage accident insurance plan for the duration of your program. An additional fee of $80 for this coverage (regardless of program length) will be added to your student account once we receive your Medical Authorization form indicating that you do not have insurance.
* This short-term insurance plan has limited coverage in the event of an accident or emergency illness while on campus or during program-sponsored activities only and is subject to a deductible. We recommend that students without a U.S. insurance policy additionally purchase travel insurance for added protection.
* The plan cannot be extended beyond program dates and does not provide coverage during travel to and from campus.

##### **Not included in program fees:**

* Travel to and from Brown’s campus or a BEE or BELL program site.
* Pre/post-program accommodations.
* Course materials and textbooks (if required).
* Additional spending money (for shopping, off-campus snacks, purchases of a personal nature etc.).
* Costs associated with potential public health guidelines, which may include, but are not limited to, travel interruption and quarantine. We recommend students/parents/guardians consider purchasing travel/trip insurance.
