# FAQs

## Frequently asked questions

## Can IADEP Fellow have their student loans deferred?

IADEP Fellows are full time, non-degree seeking IU Indianapolis students. To this point, IADEP fellows have received [automatic in-school student loan deferment](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/deferment#how-to-apply). However, the program cannot guarantee that federal eligibility for in-school deferment will not change during the course of the program. Fellows who do not receive in-school deferment can apply for an [income-driven repayment plan](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven) such as PAYE or RePAYE. These plans lower obligatory monthly student loan payments based on discretionary income.

All graduates have a six-month grace period before they are required to begin payments towards their federal student loan debt. Any applicant with questions related to student loans should contact their [loan servicer](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers).

## How many credit hours can IADEP fellows enroll into?

IADEP Fellows are required to enroll into a minimum of six credit hours per semester. Up to four credits per semester can be lab credits. Courses can be both at the graduate and undergraduate level, but are subject to program approval. A list of recommended courses will be distributed each semester.

All tuition and fees will be fully paid by the program.

## Do fellows need to have taken the GRE before applying to IADEP

Applicants do not need a GRE score to apply to IADEP, but they are invited to include their score in their application should they have already taken the exam.

All fellows will participate in an extensive GRE review course during the IADEP and are highly encouraged to take the exam in preparation for this course. The program will cover each fellow’s GRE testing fees one time.

## Is IADEP a good option for graduates interested in medical school or an MD/PhD program?

IADEP is open to all eligible post-baccalaureate students with intentions to earn an MD, PhD, or both. However, please be aware that the application process and timelines for MD and MD/PhD programs differ from PhD programs (for example, requiring the MCAT vs. the GRE). As part of normal credit-hour requirements, fellows are permitted to take a one-credit Medical School Application Preparation course. The program will also arrange meetings with individuals who can assist in preparing for the MD application process.

## Is housing provided to IADEP Fellows? Will fellows need to drive to campus?

IADEP does not offer permanent housing to fellows, but it can provide assistance in finding housing and can offer a limited housing option during the first month of employment. Fellows are advised to explore housing options within the Indianapolis area during this time. Fellows newly arrived to Indianapolis can make use of IU Indianapolis’s [Living in Indianapolis resource page](https://international.indianapolis.iu.edu/indianapolis/index.html) and [Off-Campus Housing Guide](https://international.indianapolis.iu.edu/indianapolis/housing/off-campus.html) to research housing options and recommendations.

For fellows living off-campus, having reliable transportation is imperative. It is recommended that fellows research the [Transportation in Indianapolis resource page](https://international.indianapolis.iu.edu/indianapolis/transportation.html) to familiarize themselves with travel options in the city and to decide if they will need a car.

## How does IADEP define “individual from medically underserved backgrounds”?

* Were or currently are homeless, as defined by [the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act](https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/)

Only one of a.) or b.) can be used as a criterion for the disadvantaged background definition.
