#### About Rice Bio Academies

The Rice Bio Academies, offered by the Rice Office of STEM Engagement, is a one-week, immersive summer enrichment program designed for high school students currently in 9th through 11th grade (2024–2025 school year) who have completed or are currently enrolled in Biology.

The academy is divided into two focused sections: Biotech and Biomed, allowing students to explore specialized areas of science through real-world applications and cutting-edge lab techniques.

Students will engage in hands-on STEM activities and project-based design challenges that reflect the rapidly evolving biotechnology and biomedical landscape. Activities include DNA extraction and analysis, micropipetting, bacterial transformation, and PTC gene testing. Participants will also take part in lab sessions led by Rice University faculty and graduate students, gaining firsthand exposure to research tools and techniques.

Throughout both tracks, students will strengthen their understanding of genetics, develop critical thinking skills, and build confidence in STEM through interactive labs, guest speakers, and team-based challenges. The program also promotes growth mindset and emotional intelligence by connecting students with professionals who serve as mentors, role models, and career guides—preparing them for academic success and future STEM careers.

    We reserve the right to revoke the registration of any child who consistently disrupts normal activities and does not abide by the [Rice Code of Conduct](https://sjp.rice.edu/code-of-student-conduct). While this is a rare occurrence, it is important to note that consistent disruptions diminish the experience of the other participants. No refund will be made if a child is dismissed from the program due to disrupting program activities.

We do allow registration transfers to occur but with some caveats. Registration is not transferable to anyone outside your immediate family, and split sessions are unavailable. Decisions related to transfer requests will be based on space availability and will be made at the discretion of R-STEM staff. These transfer requests must be made by sending an email to [stem@rice.edu](mailto:stem@rice.edu?subject=R-STEM%202025%20Summer%20Programs) (phone requests for transfers will not be accepted).Session transfers will only be allowed at least five working days before the start of the session.
