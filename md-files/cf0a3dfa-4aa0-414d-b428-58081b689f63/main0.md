#### Regional Ambassadors

We have found that the best way for students to learn about our program’s opportunities and resources is directly through their school.

The goal of Advanced Science Exploratory Program’s regional ambassador program is to maximize accessibility of our content to students.

Regional Ambassadors are exceptional students (grades 9-12) chosen to actively help partner high schools in their geographic region with ASciencePro. This will allow more schools, and therefore more students, to access the content and opportunities through our program.

**Your effort as a Scientific Regional Ambassador *could* result in access to the following opportunities:**

* Acknowledgement on our program’s website
* Signed Certificate of Excellence
* Free registration to select seminars
* 1:1 Mentorship with a Scientist (30 minutes)
* Opportunity to publish an Article Review in C&C Editorials, ASciencePro’s online journal
