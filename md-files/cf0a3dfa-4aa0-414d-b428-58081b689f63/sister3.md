## **Available Scholarships**

#### **Income-Based Scholarships**

One of the core aspects of our program’s mission is to extend opportunities to students who are limited in their access to in-depth brain scientific topics or career advancement opportunities.

We offer sliding scale income-based scholarships to fund student’s registration for our seminar series and career mentorship services.

***If you are interested in receiving an income-based scholarship for one of our seminar series, please apply below!***

#### **Teacher Nomination Program**

We are deeply invested in providing resources to students based on their demonstrated passion for scientific studies, and feel the best way to access such students is through our teacher.

**Educator-Based Scholarship**: If you are an educator and feel your student would benefit from attending one of our seminars, you can nominate them to receive a fully funded scholarship towards a seminar of their choice. We are a young non-profit with limited resources, but we do our best to fund as many nominees as we can.

**School-Based Scholarship**: Additionally, in partnership with schools, for every 6 students that register for one of our seminars from a single school, we will offer a fully funded scholarship for that school to grant to a student of their choice.
