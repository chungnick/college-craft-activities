Applications for SHTEM 2026 are now open. Decisions are expected to be released in March 2026. To apply, please fill out the [application form here](https://forms.gle/Z3aj4PvDcdvgStXe8) (further details below), and pay the one-time nonrefundable application fee of $95. At this time, we are only accepting applications from US Citizens and Permanent Residents.

* The Summer 2026 program will be in-person at Stanford University
* Decisions will be emailed out in March 2026
* The SHTEM 2026 program will run for 8 weeks over the summer of 2026 between June 22 - August 14 (dates subject to change)

The Stanford Compression Forum is offering its annual summer internship program for the Summer of 2026. We are looking for passionate high school students interested in pursuing fun research projects over the summer.

 This internship is intended to provide early exposure to research transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries. Students will be grouped to multifaceted projects that will benefit from their existing interests and strengths, while exposing them to new areas. Projects will be mentored by students, faculty and staff of the Stanford Compression Forum and its affiliated organizations. Themes will span and combine the science of information and communication, engineering, the arts, linguistics, psychology, biology, neuroscience, computer science, technology, philosophy, and design, among other areas.

#### Program Goals:

* Provide high school early exposure to cutting-edge research in an academic environment
* Introduce students to the diversity of research topics pursued in engineering
* Emphasize the inseparability of the humanities and the human element from research in STEM

#### Eligibility (all requirements must be met to apply):

* Must be currently a high school junior or senior in the 2025-2026 school year (i.e. 11th or 12th grade at the time of application)
* If you are a high school junior or senior, you must be at least 14 by June 21.
* Must be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident.

**No exceptions can be made for any eligibility requirements (e.g. if you are currently a high school sophomore, you are not eligible to apply).**

#### Program:

SHTEM 2026 will run over the summer. Students are expected to attend the entire duration of the internship. The session will run from June 2026 - August 2026.

#### Housing and Transportation:

The program for Summer 2026 will be on-campus but housing will not be provided through SHTEM. Students and families are responsible for arranging their own accommodation and commuting to Stanford. There may be a small stipend available to support commuting for select students.

#### Application:

Applications for SHTEM 2026 are now open. Please find the application link here: <https://forms.gle/Z3aj4PvDcdvgStXe8>

*Please review the eligibility requirements before applying, as applications that don't meet all requirements will not be considered. The one-time application fee of $95 is nonrefundable. If the application fee presents a financial burden, financial aid (fee waivers) are available.*

#### Financial Assistance:

Although this internship is unpaid, if spending the time needed to participate in this program would pose a financial burden, please let us know in your application.

We’d love to be able to admit all applicants. But that is not realistic. If you’re not admitted, it’s because we failed to integrate you into the few projects we were able to create with our group of mentors.

Presentation Day from Summer 2020

**March 2020** SHTEM was highlighted by **Stanford News**! Check out our interview with them here: [High school interns inspire new research paths](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/03/02/high-school-interns-inspire-new-research-paths/).

**December 2019**

SHTEM was mentioned on the 2019 series finale of HBO's *Silicon Valley* (the above photo shows SHTEM on the whiteboard). Richard Hendricks serves as a great fictional mentor! Read more about Professor Tsachy Weissman's involvement in the program [here](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/16/qa-stanford-faculty-silicon-valley/). Two interns from 2019, **Aditi Talati** and **Karan Bhasin** had their work from the summer accepted at the **2020 Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** conference. Congratulations!
