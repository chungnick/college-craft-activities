# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### SONYC: is an introduction to the study of noise pollution, one of the topmost quality-of-life issues for urban residents in the United States and particularly in NYC. Students will be able to study the public health consequences of sound by sampling sounds, studying sound waves in local communities, building devices that make and monitor sound, and evaluating how pollution ultimately affects human well-being. Students will demonstrate the skills and knowledge they learn by creating actual smart city technologies that they present at an end-of-program expo.

###### Sound sampling and analysis in the real world

###### Electronics and device building

###### Theater-based communication training and games

###### Smart city technology development

### Explore the science of sound and create solutions for urban noise pollution through technology and engineering

# Meet Our Mentors

##### SONYC comes from a historical project with Professor Juan Bello's Music Audio Research Lab and a National Science Foundation research collaboration with Tandon faculty Luke DuBois (integrated design and media), Claudio Silva (computer science), and Oded Nov (technology and culture).
