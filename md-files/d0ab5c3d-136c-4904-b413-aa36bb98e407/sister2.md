# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

Are these official Georgetown University courses?

* Yes, all of these courses (both the enrichment and credit-bearing courses) are from Georgetown University and designed specifically for high school students. Georgetown faculty design the course curricula and teach the courses in pre-recorded videos.
* For enrichment courses, students earn a Certificate of Completion from Georgetown University for each course completed. If you’ve completed a Georgetown Pre-College Online Program enrichment course, you’ll receive your certificate via email about one week after the completion date.
* For college credit courses, students earn three credits and receive a transcript. If you’ve completed a Pre-College Online Program college credit course, you can request your [official or unofficial transcript through the University registrar page here.](https://registrar.georgetown.edu/records/transcripts/)

What age group or academic level are these courses for?

* These courses are designed for high school or U.S.-high-school-equivalent students, including those who are taking a “gap year” between high school and college. Students should be 13 and up, not yet enrolled in college, and no more than 1 year post-high school graduation (“gap year”).
* These courses are not intended for college students or adults.
* We are unable to accept students under 13 years of age.

Will these courses work with my schedule? What if I have other commitments during the course?

**Enrichment Courses**

* Yes, these courses are designed to be 100% flexible between your start and end dates. The lesson content is asynchronous, meaning you study whenever you’d like.
* Since no live meetings or specific study times are required, you can plan your course time around your other commitments as long as you have approximately 30 total hours to devote to the course between the start and end dates of your chosen cohort/session.

**College Credit Courses**

* Courses are 100% online to allow for maximum flexibility, but all required assignments and projects must be completed before the course end date.
* Since no live meetings or specific study times are required, you can plan your course time around your other commitments as long as you have approximately 130 total hours to devote to the course between the start and end dates of your chosen cohort/session.

What if I don’t know which session fits my schedule? / Can I defer or switch to a different course cohort?

If you aren't sure which dates are best for you, we recommend that you enroll in the cohort most likely to work and switch later if needed.

Can I take more than one course?

Yes! There is no limit to how many courses you can take. In fact, many of our students find it beneficial to take multiple courses to fully explore their academic areas of interest.

Will this course be taught in my time zone?

Can I use these courses toward a degree at Georgetown?

College credit courses are offered through the School of Continuing Studies and are not part of an undergraduate degree program. For students who later attend Georgetown University for undergraduate studies, the application of credits will be subject to the applicable College or School’s academic policies and degree requirements.

Will the course credits transfer to another university?

Every university and college sets its own policies about whether to accept credits from another institution of higher learning. We recommend you keep each course syllabus in addition to the official Georgetown University transcript that you request directly from the University Registrar’s Office. We cannot guarantee that any institution will accept Georgetown University credits. Please consult with the receiving institution regarding transfer policies and procedures.

How will I receive my transcript for the college credit courses? 

After your Pre-College Online Program college credit course end date, you will receive an email from Georgetown University with your NetID and password. Using these credentials, you can access your [official or unofficial transcript here through the University registrar page](https://registrar.georgetown.edu/records/transcripts/). Note: If you need an official paper transcript, they are available for a fee.

Can parents access student applications, academic records, or other information?

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) affords certain rights to Parents and Eligible Students in regards to Education Records that are maintained by schools and universities. When a student reaches 18 years of age or attends an institution of postsecondary education (regardless of age), the student becomes an Eligible Student, and rights under FERPA generally transfer from the Parent to the Eligible Student.

As a result, we are unable to share Education Records with anyone other than the enrolled student. If a parent or guardian would like information about their student’s application or their student’s participation, progress, or grades in a program, they may request that their student share this information with them. If the student does not have access to the information, the student may request it by contacting us at [support@precollegeonline.georgetown.edu](mailto:support@precollegeonline.georgetown.edu).

What are the drop and withdraw policies?

**See the College Credit Academic Calendar [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKeJ6HseWM-B5lI7PQu6t9xM3R5kr_09gtAA28HET-ELE9nwuwxiHiXGnUTwGp77r9rEtMlSZ5z61F/pub).**

What if a student has a documented disability and requires academic accommodations and/or special physical needs? Who must they contact to make sure these needs are met?

We are committed to accessibility, inclusivity, and serving individuals with different abilities.  To help make the course experience accessible and inclusive, all videos feature closed-captioning and variable playback speed with unlimited viewing; the platform and content are screen-reader-friendly; and quizzes and assignments are untimed; and all work is due on the course end date.

If you require accommodations, please contact **[support@precollegeonline.georgetown.edu](mailto:support@precollegeonline.georgetown.edu)** so that the Pre-College Online Programs team may coordinate your accommodation request with the appropriate department(s). Please contact early and prior to your start date to allow time for the accommodations review process and implementation of any required accommodations.

## Assignments & Grading

How will you be graded? 

**College Credit Courses**
