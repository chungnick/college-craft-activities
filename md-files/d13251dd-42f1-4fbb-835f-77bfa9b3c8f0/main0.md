# My Introduction to Engineering (MITE)

MITE is a five-day summer camp designed for **current high school juniors** to explore the world of engineering through an **immersive and engaging experience**. During the program, students will work collaboratively on an engineering team project, participate in hands-on activities and connect with engineering students, faculty, staff and alumni.

The goal of MITE is to give students an authentic look into what it means to study and pursue a **future in engineering**.

MITE is open to students who demonstrate a strong interest in engineering, science or mathematics. Each session will welcome 50 students, selected through a holistic review process. All eligible students residing in the United States are invited to apply.\* While we do not yet have a confirmed date for program admission decisions, we anticipate finalizing all selections by mid-May and will share updates as soon as they are available.

Student participants will stay in a campus residence hall, allowing them to experience life at The University of Texas at Austin while engaging fully in all program activities.

*\*We strongly encourage applications from students who have overcome socio-economic challenges or who have had limited access to engineering courses or extracurricular STEM opportunities at their schools. These perspectives and experiences enrich the program and align with our mission to broaden participation in engineering.*

* **Session 1**: June 21 – June 26, 2026
* **Session 2**: July 12 – July 16, 2026
