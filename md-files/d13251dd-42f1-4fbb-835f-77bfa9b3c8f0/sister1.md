# MITE FAQs

Learn more about the MITE program by reviewing these frequently asked questions:

## Eligibility

Who is MITE for?

MITE is a five-day camp for current high school juniors to discover engineering through participation in an engineering team project, hands-on activities and interactions with engineering students, faculty, staff and alumni.

Is MITE only for juniors?

Yes, MITE is only for rising seniors (current juniors).

## Applications

When do camp applications usually open? When do they close?

Applications open mid-December and close on March 1st at 11:59PM.

What criteria are used in reviewing applications?

We review each application holistically, with particular attention to your academic preparation—such as your essays, grades, class rank, extracurricular involvement, and your interest in participating in MITE. Many applicants are exceptional students and leaders within their communities. In addition to academic strength, we also consider socioeconomic factors to ensure that opportunities are accessible to students who may be overcoming social or economic hardship.

Each year, we receive approximately 800 applications and admit around 100 students in total.

What does it mean if I’m waitlisted?

If an accepted participant decides not to attend, we will promptly reach out to waitlisted applicants to offer any newly opened spots for the camp.

Will participating in MITE boost my chances of later acceptance into the Cockrell School?

Students are encouraged to list participation in MITE on their admissions application or write about their experiences in their college essay if they choose to do so. However, MITE students receive no extra advantage in the admissions process and no extra points based on participation.

For a list of the academic and personal achievement factors considered for college acceptance at UT Austin, visit [Texas Admissions](http://admissions.utexas.edu/).

## Cost and Scholarships

What is the cost of this camp experience?

**Participant Cost**: $200  
  
Payment will only be submitted after a participant has been accepted into the program. This non-refundable commitment fee helps secure your place in a high-quality, immersive educational experience at a world-renowned engineering school, including a week-long stay in a university residence hall. The program’s low cost is made possible through generous philanthropic support. Scholarships are available for those who meet the eligibility criteria.

Are there transportation scholarships to MITE?

Students are responsible for coordinating their own transportation to and from The University of Texas at Austin, whether by air, bus, car, etc. Check-in and Check-out times will be the same for participants regardless of travel arrangements, so we encourage attendees to make travel arrangements accordingly.

Do I have to pay for meals and housing during MITE?

Meals and housing for MITE participants are funded through generous support from the Cockrell School of Engineering, the Texas Workforce Commission grant and additional sponsors who help make the program possible.

## Travel & Lodging

Does this program include lodging?

Yes, MITE includes lodging for students in an on-campus dorm.

Am I eligible as an out-of-state student to attend MITE?

Yes, both in-state and out-of-state students may attend MITE.

Will I be able to choose my roommate?  

In order to provide participants with the collegiate experience, roommate matches are pre-selected (often with students from a different school). Successful students at The University of Texas at Austin have demonstrated the ability to adapt to different environments and a desire to broaden their perspectives. At MITE, we hope to foster this growth.

May I arrive late or leave early?

Sunday drop-off is from 2:00PM to 3:00PM. Thursday camp concludes at 12:00PM. We are not able to accommodate a late or early check-in or check-out time. Please adjust your schedule accordingly.

May I bring my car?

Parents are encouraged to drop off and pick up their student(s). However, if this cannot be arranged, students may bring their own cars. Parking will be available in one of the UT Austin campus garages for approximately $15 – $18 per day. Students cannot drive their cars or leave campus at any time during the program. This rule will be strictly enforced.

## During MITE

Is there a dress code?

We expect students to use their judgment in dressing like young adults. Students should dress casually for hot weather (shorts and T-shirts are fine) and bring comfortable walking shoes. There will be a lot of walking every day. Students will be required to change their clothing if it is offensive or inappropriate.

May I leave campus?

Students are not allowed to leave campus without the supervision of a MITE counselor or the MITE coordinator. Students are not allowed to leave campus with visitors during the program.

May I have visitors during MITE?

MITE will have structured opportunities for friends and family to visit. More information will be provided during orientation on the first day of MITE.

In order to create a comfortable and safe environment for all students, visitors will not be permitted in the dorm, except when parents pick up or drop off their student(s). MITE counselors will stay in the dorms with the students.

May I attend other non-MITE activities during the program?

While it is great that MITE students are involved in many different activities, unfortunately, students will not be allowed to leave campus to fulfill other obligations (night classes, swim practice, etc.). During MITE, students will participate in group projects, activities and seminars from morning to night.

Full participation is required from students so that they may benefit from the entire program.
