# Institute for Future Agricultural Leaders (IFAL)

### NC Farm Bureau has a long history of investing in our state’s youth and especially those interested in agriculture.

That’s why we have programs like the Institute for Future Ag. Leaders (IFAL). IFAL is a unique week-long leadership development program for rising high school seniors interested in careers in agriculture. Emphasis is placed on career opportunities, emerging technology, citizenship and leadership development.

IFAL Applications are available here or you can obtain one from your local county Farm Bureau offices. (Applications for 2026 are currently OPEN)

## Activities

Students will visit the schools of agriculture, tour research farms and explore university laboratories. They will visit agribusinesses, participate in leadership development classes, tour the General Assembly, and see the offices of North Carolina Farm Bureau.

## Supervision

Students will be supervised by conference counselors, university faculty and Farm Bureau staff. Students will experience college life firsthand, living in dorms and eating in dining halls on campus.
