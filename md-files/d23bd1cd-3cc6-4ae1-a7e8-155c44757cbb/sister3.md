# Tuition & Fees

ON THIS PAGE

ON THIS PAGE

The below tuition rates and policies are for students registering through the Courses at Tufts platform during the Academic Year, either as a non-matriculated student or as a Tufts student registering for courses and programs outside of their degree program.

* If you are a Tufts student trying to register for a course that applies to your degree program, please register as you normally would through [SIS](https://sis.uit.tufts.edu/).
* If you are a high school student looking to register for these courses, please register through [Courses at Tufts for High Schoolers](/high-school/programs/courses-high-schoolers).

## Non-Degree / Visiting Students

Tuition: For-Credit Courses (Academic Year and Summer)

**Registration Fee:**$65 per academic year (Fall - Summer), non-refundable

**Course Tuition – For Credit:**tuition is charged on a per-credit basis for most courses. Each course listing will indicate the total cost of that course. The per-credit rate typically ranges from $250-$1,900 depending on the field of study and the level of credit desired (Graduate or Undergraduate). Please note that this is real University credit and, in many cases, may be able to be applied to a Degree or Certificate program at Tufts University (pending admission to the degree program).

**Course Tuition – Audit:**tuition is charged on a per course basis. Each course listing will indicate whether the course is open for audit and what the audit rate is. The audit rate typically ranges from $995-$1,300 per course depending on the field of study. Please note that when you audit a course, you do not receive course credit, though the course will still appear on your transcript.

Tuition: Workshops

Workshops are academic programs that are not offered for credit, including those offered by the School of the Museum of the Fine Arts (SMFA) Continuing Education. Tuition and fees for any students participating in these programs can be found on the workshop listing. Courses are clearly identified as workshops in the course list. Without this designation, courses are covered by one of the above policies.

Workshops range in price, depending on a variety of factors. Please see below for additional information on fees and other financial policies.

**Notes**

* Check the course listing “Special Note” for information about course hours
* Credit is not available for these courses
* Some classes require students to purchase materials; any materials needed for the first class will be communicated to enrolled students by the instructor.
* If you are a high school student, please register for workshops through [Courses at Tufts for High Schoolers](/high-school/programs/courses-high-schoolers)

Fees: Late Fees

#### Late Registration Fee

A **late registration fee** will be added to any registration occurring past the add-drop period of any term.

#### Late Payment Fee

A **late payment fee**will be applied to student balances that remain on or after the first day of the course session. This amount will be 1.5% of the balance, and will be compounded monthly.

Fees: Materials & Lab Fees

Select courses may have materials or lab fees, typically ranging from $100-$500 range. These fees should be listed on the course listing.
