## Support the Yale Center for Civic Thought

The Yale Center for Civic Thought was established in 2025 to renew and strengthen the foundations of civic life. Working at three levels of community—on campus, in greater New Haven, and nationally—the Center encourages thoughtful public discourse informed by the history of political thought and American democratic traditions. Our approach to civic education prioritizes small, rigorous conversations, rooted in place, deepened by reading, and linked to practical expertise. In a moment when civic understanding and dialogue across lines of deep disagreement are more vital than ever, we invite you to help sustain this work.
