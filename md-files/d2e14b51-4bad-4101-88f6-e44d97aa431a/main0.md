Summer@RPI: Virtual Program 

POLYMER CHEMISTRY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

Program goals:

The goal of this research project is to provide the high school students with the opportunities to have hands-on virtual research experience of (1) making samples by 3D printing/3D laser cutting of plastics and (2) characterizing plastic materials using FTIR spectroscopy, tensile mechanical property test, and thermal analysis instrument in polymer center at RPI.  Student will (3) have better understanding on the thermal properties of polymers, such as glass transition and melting temperatures, which will be the main consideration to dictate the usage of polymers in modern life and (4) ultimately enhance their awareness of plastic recycling issues.  

Learning Objectives:

1.       Students will learn the fundamental knowledge on polymer chemistry. The faculty instructor will provide a few lectures to expand chemistry learning on periodic table, molecule drawing and monomer/polymer concepts.

2.       Students will learn the 3D printing of polymers by having hands-on activities of making 3D printed polymer parts.

3.       Students will learn the basic knowledge on plastic materials, which includes how different types of plastic materials that they used for soda bottles, soda bottle caps, milk jugs, grocery bags, etc. 

4.    Students will learn how to process the raw data into materials information to be reported in research.    Specifically, during the "virtual polymer laboratory" sessions, students will learn how to process and extract materials information from Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile mechanical test and other instruments to characterize polymers. 

Pre-requisite:

High-school Chemistry Course(s).  Although it is optional, students may want to submit his/her transcript showing chemistry course(s) in the application to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  Recommendation letter from teachers is not required for the application.

·       Prior to attending the summer program, students are encouraged to watch the on-line classes on polymer characterization and properties by Prof. Ryu. [https://www.ryupolymer.org/classes/intro-polymer-chem-chem4460](https://exchange.rpi.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=TzKULbnLRyjDavySmMy0_dGCxf4wX0FumG6YI-ztRCf7sVowuPrYCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ryupolymer.org%2fclasses%2fintro-polymer-chem-chem4460)

·       Students must have a laptop computer (PC or Mac) to attend the virtual summer program using WebEx and will use MS Office or Google Drive APP’s to finish the assignments.
