# Find direction. Achieve success.

We're empowering the next generation of values-based leaders.

Leaders can be made. It takes a solid foundation of essential values for a leader to realize potential – and influence others to achieve their best. This is values-based leadership, and it underpins every program within the Shelton Leadership Center.

We work with emerging values-based leaders across the state of North Carolina and beyond who positively impact their communities through their leadership.

20+ Years of Leadership Development

## A vision realized.

With a lifelong commitment to military and civil service that culminated in his becoming our nation’s 14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General H. Hugh Shelton knows what it means to lead with integrity. Following his retirement, General Shelton wanted to help nurture tomorrow’s leaders through a values-based leadership development program in association with his alma mater, North Carolina State University. So, in 2002, the Shelton Leadership Center was established.
