The Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA) invites print and online publication staff to take part in its 45th Annual Summer Journalism Workshop, offered with both in-person and virtual options. CSPA offers two week-long, in-person sessions in June and July on the Columbia campus, as well as three distinct virtual sessions in July. The annual workshop is organized by CSPA and hosted by Columbia University. We offer workshops in reporting and writing, editorial leadership, digital media, broadcast journalism, and design. 

We also offer residential and commuter students gym access,  co-curricular activities, media visits, and an evening at a Broadway show.

The workshop is intended for secondary school students from schools in the U.S. and international schools following an American plan of education. Participation in the Workshop is open to all students from senior high schools, whether public, private, or faith-based. No junior high or middle school students are accepted. To sign up for CSPA communications, please contact us at: cspa [[at]] columbia [[dot]] edu.
