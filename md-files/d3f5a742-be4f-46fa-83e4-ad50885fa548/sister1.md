#### About the Logo

#### Blue, red, and yellow are also the colors on the flag of the Philippines. The majestic Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi Ogilvie-Grant, 1896) is the country's national bird and so figures prominently in the logo. The microbes and DNA base pairs, in yellow, represent the normally unseen yet no less essential elements of biodiversity. The logo was designed by Dr. Janlo Robil.
