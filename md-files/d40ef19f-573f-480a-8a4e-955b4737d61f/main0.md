## 2026 Program Dates: July 11, 2026 – July 25, 2026

The Appalachian STEM Academy at Oak Ridge is an all-expenses-paid, residential program in Oak Ridge, Tennessee designed to provide a hands-on STEM learning experience for students and teachers located in the Appalachian region. In addition to research, the program promotes teamwork, college opportunities, and pride in the cultural richness and historical importance of the Appalachian region.

* **Middle School Students:** For one week, students work with master teachers to build knowledge in current STEM topics to solve a problem in Appalachian communities. This program is for current 6th-8th graders.
* **Bridge Program:** For two weeks, students work with master teachers, university researchers, and other professionals to expand upon topics previously learned in the middle school program. This program is for current high school students who completed the middle school program and are under the age of 16.
* **High School Students:** For two weeks, students experience hands-on, relevant research projects mentored by ORNL scientists. To be eligible, students must currently be in 9th, 10th, or 11th grade and will be 16 or older by the program start date.
* **High School Teachers:** For two weeks, teachers engage in professional development by conducting collaborative research projects mentored by ORNL and ORAU scientists. Teachers must currently teach a STEM-related high school course in the Appalachian Region to apply.

**2025 applications are now closed. Selections will be made in the spring.**

When I left Ohio 2 weeks ago I was super shy and always stuck to myself and had so much trouble finding people with common interests and coming here changed that! Never stop doing this amazing thing for kids all over Appalachia.”
