# **Appalachian STEM Academy at Oak Ridge - Middle School**

The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), in collaboration with ORAU in Oak Ridge, Tenn., presents a one-week, residential, hands-on science academy focusing on math, science, and technology for two cohorts of middle school students in July.

The ARC Appalachian STEM Academy at Oak Ridge is a unique opportunity for students to work in small collaborative teams with experienced teachers to utilize current technology to solve a problem in Appalachian communities. The small team approach provides an opportunity to collaboratively tackle a real-world issue in Appalachia and propose a solution to the issue through a hands-on, inquiry-based approach.

The Academy curriculum is developed by area Master Teachers utilizing national and state science standards, area scientific expertise, and best practices in education. The Master Teachers also arrange tours, speakers, and assume primary teaching responsibilities for content delivery, hands-on experimentation, data collection, data analysis and final presentations. Three assistant teachers typically assist with the curriculum presentation and daily student explorations and research.

In addition to the science activities, each day will include group sessions where students will be given the opportunity to apply what they have learned from the day’s events. This builds a better understanding of the day’s science activities and allows students to apply their knowledge in a hands on approach to science.

The week culminates with final presentations where each group presents their project to an audience of ARC and ORAU dignitaries, parents, and friends.
