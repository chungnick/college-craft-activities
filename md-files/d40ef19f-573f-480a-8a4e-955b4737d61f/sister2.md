# **Appalachian STEM Academy at Oak Ridge - Bridge Program**

## **Program Dates: July 5, 2025 – July 18, 2025**

The Appalachian STEM Academy Bridge Program is a two-week, fully funded, hands-on learning experience for those students who previously completed the Middle School Academy but are not yet old enough to apply for the Appalachian STEM Academy High School Program. The Appalachian STEM Academy Bridge Program is hosted by Oak Ridge Associated Universities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and builds upon the knowledge the participants gained in the Middle School Academy. All participants work with master teachers, university researchers, and other professionals to conduct guided group STEM research projects. The program culminates in a final group presentation where participants showcase their work.
