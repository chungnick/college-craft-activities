# **Appalachian STEM Academy - High School**

## **Program Dates: July 11, 2026 – July 25, 2026**

The Appalachian STEM Academy at Oak Ridge is a two-week, fully funded, hands-on learning experience for Appalachia's high school students who are 16 and older. Participating students work with award-winning scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy research facility, on guided group science, math, computer science and technology projects. The program provides students – many of whom come from economically distressed counties – with valuable exposure to applied STEM education, concluding with a graduation ceremony where participants showcase their work.

**Requirements**

* Must be a U.S. citizen
* Must be age 16 or older by start date of program
* Must reside in or attend a public, private, charter, or homeschool in a designated Appalachian county (see <http://www.arc.gov/counties>)
* Must plan to enroll in a public, private, charter, or homeschool in a designated Appalachian county for the 2026-2027 school year, or reside in such designated Appalachian county
* Must be willing to follow all program and safety instruction
* Must be able to participate in all program activities for the full program period
