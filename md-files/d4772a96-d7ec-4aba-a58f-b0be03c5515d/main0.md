**DISCOVER ARCHITECTURE** is a summer workshop held at the Oklahoma State University School of Architecture
in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The workshop is open to high school students who are interested
in exploring careers in architecture and architectural engineering. Through a series
of hands-on design projects students get firsthand experience with the architectural
design process; allowing students to determine if pursuing a degree and career in
architecture or architectural engineering is for them.

Discover Architecture serves as an immersive introduction to architecture and architectural
engineering for students considering college studies and future jobs in these disciplines.
