### OSU, CEAT, and SOA Scholarships

Oklahoma State University has made a significant commitment to attracting the most
capable students possible and providing them with financial incentives to enroll and
graduate.  Following the University’s commitment, CEAT and the SOA have followed suit
with significant success in growing endowments focused on funding for scholarships
and enrichment activities for SOA students and faculty.  The SOA has benefited greatly
from this increase in financial aid to promote academic excellence.

Endowments support approximately $100,000/year of student scholarships for School
of Architecture students.  Annual gifts provide another $20,000 plus in additional
scholarships, project support, and competition prizes.  The majority of the scholarships
are awarded to continuing students and most are targeted to students who have been
admitted to the Professional Program (third, fourth, and fifth years of the curriculum.

OSU and CEAT provide additional scholarships for incoming freshman.

### Transferring?

Students wishing to transfer credits from another university undergoes a rigorous
process to determine transfer credit.  First, the Registrar, and then the College
of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology Student Services review all general education
courses and determine if that course meets OSU requirements.  For any Professional
Studies course, including courses that might meet NAAB Student Performance Criteria,
the School of Architecture academic advisor requires the student to demonstrate that
these criteria have been met through the submittal of course work and materials. A
portfolio is required to consider any transfer of design studio hour credit.  The
advisor consults with faculty members responsible for teaching the NAAB Student Performance
Criteria material and a determination is made regarding each case individually.

# Pre-College Students

## Discover Architecture

The **“DISCOVER ARCHITECTURE”** summer workshop introduces the fields of Architecture and Architectural Engineering
to potential university students through academic projects that are designed to stimulate
creativity...

## ASTEK Program

In the Fall of 1999, the members of the **American Institute of Architecture Students at OSU** decided to become more involved in the community. With permission from the Stillwater
Board of Education, a small group of members entered two classrooms at Will Rogers
Elementary, equipped with a workbook they had created. The objective was to teach
fifth grade students general principles of architecture, and the world that surrounds
them. A new program named ASTEK - Architecture Students Teaching Elementary Kids -
was born.
