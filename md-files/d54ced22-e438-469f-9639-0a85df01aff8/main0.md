## FAQs

Can I apply to multiple courses?

You may apply for up to two courses per semester (one morning session course and one afternoon session course). Please check the course schedule to verify those you apply for don’t conflict with one another.

How selective is the program?

Career Edge is a selective program, and students offered admission typically have a B grade average or higher.

Is there an application fee?

No, the application is free. However, tuition fees are charged for each course taken. After students are admitted, they will be registered for their selected course(s) and a tuition bill will be generated.

*No financial aid, scholarships or discounts are available for Weekend Workshops.*

When will I know my admissions decision?

Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, which means we will review and act on complete applications as they are received.

What happens if the course I want is full?

If your first choice course is full or closed, we'll do our best to enroll you in a similar course or help you find another course of interest. Courses are available on a first-come, first-served basis, so we encourage you to apply early.

What will I "walk away" with?

You'll gain new knowledge of your selected subject, a final course project to add to your portfolio, and an NYU transcript that shows the letter grade you earned in the course as proof of participation.

*These courses do not grant college or high school credit.*

Will completing the program help me gain admission to NYU?

Successful completion of any NYU School of Professional Studies High School Academy course will add to your admissions profile, but participation in the High School Academy does not guarantee admission to NYU or to any other university.
