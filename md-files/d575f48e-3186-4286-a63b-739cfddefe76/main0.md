# Ania Picard Pathways Program

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **About  Ania Picard** The Ania Picard Pathways Program at the Maryland Robotics Center honors longtime Assistant Director Ania Picard, whose leadership since 2010 helped lay the foundation for robotics education at UMD. Established to expand opportunities for students, the program offers hands-on internships, mentoring, and outreach. Ania’s vision led to major initiatives—including the robotics minor, ARM Institute accreditation, and the Diversity in Robotics and AI program. Her legacy lives on through this program, which continues to support and empower the next generation of robotics leaders. |  |

**The Pathways Program for the 2025–2026 academic year has been temporarily paused, and we are not accepting applications at this time. Please continue to check our website for updates, or reach out to us at robotics@umd.edu with any questions.**

###### Pathway to the PhD

The Maryland Robotics Center offers the Pathway to the PhD program to support research experiences for ENPM- and MSSE-Robotics students interested in pursuing a PhD in robotics or a related field. The Pathway to the PhD program is one semester in duration. The Pathways program is supported in part by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) under the [ArtIAMAS cooperative agreement](https://artiamas.umd.edu/).

#### **Eligibility:**

Students enrolled in the ENPM- or MSSE-Robotics programs having completed at least one semester with a minimum 3.5 GPA. Summer internships are permitted and do not count toward the semester quota.

#### **Requirements:**

* A letter of interest from the applicant affirming the student’s eligibility, UID, graduation date, mentor’s name and affiliation, desired start date, and a short description of the research topic to be pursued;
* A letter of endorsement from an MRC faculty member who will advise the participant’s research activities for a minimum of one semester. The letter should affirm that the mentor will provide research guidance to the Pathway student and that the student’s research will take place on the UMD College Park campus;
* Student resume;
* Student UMD transcript.

#### **Benefits:**

Selected participants will be supported on an hourly basis up to 10 hours per week (maximum 20 hours per pay period), subject to availability of funds and hiring approval by the Institute for Systems Research. The faculty mentor will approve the biweekly payroll.

#### **Restrictions:**

A Pathway student cannot concurrently enroll in an ENPM 808 Independent Study with the same faculty advisor as the Pathway mentor. Furthermore, a Pathway student cannot concurrently serve as a MAGE Teaching Assistant in the same semester.

#### **Application Deadline:**

Two weeks before the start of the semester for which you are applying (e.g., Fall, Spring, or Summer I). For semester start dates, please refer to the semester calendar [here](https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/about-university/academic-calendar/semester-calendar/).

**To apply, please merge the application requirements into a single PDF named as follows: Lastname\_MRC PathwaysPhD\_Semester Year (e.g., Smith\_MRC PathwaysPhD\_Spring 2025) and send to** **[robotics@umd.edu](mailto:robotics@umd.edu).**

A list of eligible MRC faculty members is available here: <https://robotics.umd.edu/faculty>

For questions or clarifications, please contact [robotics@umd.edu](mailto:robotics@umd.edu).

###### Pathway to the Profession

The Maryland Robotics Center now offers the Pathway to the Profession program to support paid and unpaid internship experiences for ENPM-Robotics and RAS-minor students interested in pursuing a career in the robotics industry. Special consideration will be given to unpaid internships at not-for-profit organizations that develop robotics technologies for the benefit of society and planet. The Pathway to the Profession program provides one semester of support from the Maryland Robotics Center.

#### **Eligibility:**

Students enrolled in the ENPM-Robotics program having completed at least one semester of the program with a minimum 3.0 GPA.

#### **Requirements:**

#### **Benefits:**

Selected participants will receive a one-time grant to support cost of living expenses, subject to availability of funds.

#### **Restrictions:**

Pathways students must fully comply with their individual visa restrictions, as applicable. In particular, F1 international students must complete the internship approval with ISSS before they apply to the Pathways program.

#### **For best consideration, please submit by May 31st.**

**To apply, please send a PDF of your application to [robotics@umd.edu](mailto:robotics@umd.edu).**
