## About UMD I-Corps

I-Corps is a National Science Foundation (NSF) program designed to foster, grow, and nurture national innovation ecosystems. The University of Maryland is the lead institution of the [NSF I-Corps Hub: Mid-Atlantic Region](https://www.midatlanticicorps.com/) and a member of the NSF [National Innovation Network](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504672).  
  
I-Corps provides real world professional development training on how to incorporate research innovations into market ready solutions to solve societal problems. The curriculum is based on the Lean Startup framework, through which researchers can better understand the market potential of an innovation and their next steps for commercialization.   
  
Participating in an introductory [I-Corps Course](/program) is a required step of commercializing technology at the University of Maryland.   
  
The program is comprised of two parts: the self-paced I-Corps Prep mini course, and the Mid-Atlantic I-Corps Customer Discovery Workshops. Participants do not need to start a company to apply or attend a workshop.

“

“Through the Mid-Atlantic I-Corps program, my start-up achieved a major breakthrough by validating our business model and identifying a clear product-market fit. The customer discovery process and mentorship helped us refine our strategy, and we’re now better positioned to pitch to investors and build impactful partnerships.”
