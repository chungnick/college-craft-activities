# Coriell Summer Experience for High School Students

**Applications for the 2026 Coriell Summer Experience have not yet opened. Please check back in late winter.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running from mid-July to mid-August, the Coriell Summer Experience for High School Students is an unpaid opportunity for high school students to work alongside career professional scientists and technicians in order to gain valuable insights and experience working within the field of the science and biotechnology industry.

Through our four-week Summer Experience program, we offer a limited number of students an exclusive opportunity to be a part of the day-to-day production activities in dynamic production and biobanking environments, and we offer the possibility to experience biobank operations.

In Coriell's **Production Laboratories**, students will focus on learning and supporting the fundamental techniques of generating, freezing, and distributing the samples that support the Coriell Biobank. Within the Stem Cell Lab, the work shifts to the exploration of induced pluripotent stem cells - a powerful research resource made from the body's skin and blood cells. The students may also observe karyotyping, a methodology designed to characterize chromosomes and identify genetic disorders. During a stint in Coriell's Molecular Biology Lab, the students will learn about and support the efforts of extracting DNA from various sample types.

Students will have the opportunity to apply for a summer experience in the following areas:

* **Production Laboratories:**

This program will also include small-group learning sessions with Coriell Human Resources to help assist in resume-building, interviewing, and formalizing how to decide about a career path.

Students will also be invited to weekly Scientific Seminars hosted by Coriell's Research Faculty, which feature formal presentations on research from either internal Coriell Faculty, or External Speakers from world-renowned Universities and Institutes.

**All applications must be submitted by May 15 to be fully considered.**

## Eligibility

Students interested in the program must:

* Be at least 17 years of age by July 1
* Have a strong interest in science (advanced science classes are preferred)
* Be available to participate in all four weeks of the program
* Must be a resident of the United States
* No lodging or transportation will be provided. All applicants should be able to commute to Coriell's facility in Camden, New Jersey.

Note: City of Camden Residents will be offered trips by Camden Loop for the longevity of their internship if requested.

## Student Presentations

At the culmination of the Summer Experience for Students program, students present a formal PowerPoint presentation discussing what they have learned at the institute to an assembly of Coriell staff and their own peers.

Students will receive a crash course from Coriell HR on best practices for Public Speaking.
