    UF research faculty engage SSTP participants in university-level research as part of the lab team. Each SSTP participant will be assigned to a research lab based upon his or her interests and experiences. During the summer, SSTP participants will assist in the on-going research of his or her assigned lab. Participants develop a working knowledge of the research conduct in his or her lab through reading scientific literature, learning lab procedures and how to use lab equipment, and then implementing a research plan as directed by the student’s faculty mentor. The research experiences offered at SSTP vary and may include clinical research, bench research, engineering projects, computer-based projects, or field work. Participants are also mentored in best lab practices, scientific inquiry, and research careers. SSTP participants write a research paper, give two research talks, and present a research poster based the work conducted in the research lab. SSTP participants from a Florida high school may earn dual enrollment credit for this competent of the program.

    #### Lectures

    The interdisciplinary lecture series is presented by UF research faculty who highlight the concepts, experimental approaches, and applications of current research. All SSTP participants attend the lecture presented each day. Lecture topics cover research in the biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and medicine. Ethics, technical writing, laboratory safety, and the role of the humanities in science are also presented. Lecture topics for previous years include: The Mathematics of Randomness, Ethical Controversies in Science, Micro Air Vehicles and Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, The Art of Writing in the Sciences, The Challenges of Tropical Diseases in the Modern World, and Climate Change: Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in the south.

    #### Seminar

    All SSTP students participate in a UF Interdisciplinary Honors Seminar Course. These small group classes (limited to 12 students) emphasize cutting edge research in the specified topics. The class curriculum incorporates lecture, library research, discussion, reaction papers, oral presentations, and quizzes. Active participation by the SSTP student creates a dynamic classroom setting. Courses are taught by post-docs, PhD candidates, and medical school students who are currently conducting research on the topic presented during the course. Students indicate a preference for which seminar classes each is assigned. Topics change yearly and have ranged from Cancer Biology and Therapeutics to Carbon Nanotube Technology for Energy Applications to Science in the News. SSTP participants from a Florida high school may earn free dual enrollment credit for this competent of the program.

SSTP Housing & Daily Life
:   #### Housing

    SSTP participants and residential staff live in a residence hall on the UF campus for the residential component of SSTP. The UF residence hall has suite-style rooms where each suite has two double-occupancy bedrooms, a kitchen, living area and a bathroom. Additionally, students will have internet and Wi-Fi access both in the residence halls and on the UF campus (please refer to the FAQ for details on how to access these services).

    SSTP residential counselors facilitate campus living through community building and help participants adjust to living away from home. Students get to know one-another through floor activities, shared meals, student socials, and small group get-togethers. Counselors engage students in activities such pick-up basketball games, running/walking groups, playing guitar/musical instruments, and other share interests. Cooking help, laundry how-to lessons, and other practical advice is provided by counselors.

    One focus of SSTP is to create a multicultural community in which students are encouraged to live and learn with students from varied backgrounds and experiences. Towards this goal, SSTP does not accept roommate requests and students from the same high school are not roomed together. The program does take into consideration such factors as a student’s study preferences, house-keeping preferences, sleep preferences, and general interests when making roommate assignments. Students selected to attend SSTP complete a Roommate Matching/Personal Interest Sheet on which he or she may indicate such preferences.

    All SSTP students participate in program-sponsored social activities, fieldtrips, and a service project. Weekly activities include a variety of social events, such as dinner socials, dances, bowling and game room activities at the Retiz Union, and UF sponsored Gator Nights. Additionally, SSTP sponsors weekend fieldtrips.

    **Meals & Dining**

    UF residence halls come equipped with small kitchens, shared by the roommates and include a fridge, stovetop and microwave.  We provide weekly grocery runs. Additionally there are many local restaurants on campus and in the immediate area.

    **Social Activities & Weekends**

    While the SSTP schedule is fairly full, some down time is provided.  Students have access to campus facilities for recreation.  Each Saturday is booked with a full day field trip or volunteering activity.  Sundays are given for down-time, grocery shopping, and working on projects.

    More specifics on daily life and what to expect are provided once a student is accepted into the SSTP Program.

SSTP Alumni Testimonial
:   As a participant of the 2019 UF SSTP program, I was one among the 82 other science fanatics. I worked in a computer science lab, and when I first found out about my lab assignment, I was baffled because I’m a complete neuroscience and biology enthusiast whose past research experience comprised only of those fields. However, now that I’ve had time to reflect on my seven-week journey, I have come to love and appreciate the research that I conducted which so harmoniously amalgamated my interests of cognitive science and ophthalmology. In essence, what I’m conveying is that without being in this program I would have kept a very narrow scope and continually refused to ever look beyond it. I’m eternally grateful for my lab for welcoming me so graciously, being so kind to explain everything to me when I was the most confused one in the room during lab meetings, and most importantly treating me like a colleague, allowing me to formulate my own project, and cheering me on every step of the way.

    Besides from experiencing a complete revelation of the fact that the applications of computer science research are so vast in the real world, I also came to value research wholeheartedly. Certain aspects of the field repeatedly remind me of how incredible it truly is. Research simply is powerful because the innovation scientists forge has the power to overcome the challenges of our world. We as researchers have the potential to create new knowledge and employ it for the betterment of all that treads the earth. Research forces us to become comfortable with what makes us uncomfortable. Shying away from something that scares you because it is out of your comfort zone is a truly detrimental process because it is when you dive into the unknown, that research truly becomes thrilling. Research challenges you in ways you never thought possible. Whether that be analyzing data to extract all the possible conclusions, reading immense amounts of papers just to formulate a research question, or failing with no possible solution in sight. Research truly is built for those who persist and fight to bring their ideas into reality. It can be so frustrating at times when nothing seems to fall in line with your plan, but the trial is well worth it when you see your work finally come to life. Research never ends. The world will keep changing, problems will continue to arise, and we will always be faced with the next imminent danger. In those situations, the process of questioning, thinking, and solving is what makes the biggest difference, and leads to a lasting imprint on our world.

    All in all, a key point I’ve been able to extract from this experience is that in research you need to dream, have confidence, learn from your failures, and enjoy your successes.
