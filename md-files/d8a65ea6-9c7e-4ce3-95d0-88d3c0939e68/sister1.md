#### 3. Pay for Your Entry

Entry fees are $10 per individual entry and $30 per portfolio. If the entry fee is a barrier to your participation in the Awards, simply select the “fee waiver” option when entering your work in the online portal. If you have received instructions from [your Affiliate](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions) about specific regional fee waiver protocols, please follow them.

If you are able to pay—please do! Your nominal entry fee helps a national community of creative teens participate in this program.

The Scholastic Awards open for entries in the fall. Deadlines are determined by region. Curious about your region’s deadline?
