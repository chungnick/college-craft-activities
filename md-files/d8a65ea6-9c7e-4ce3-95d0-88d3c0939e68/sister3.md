[### General](./#general)

What are the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards?

The Scholastic Awards are the nation’s longest-running, most prestigious recognition program for creative teens!

Each year, more than 100,000 teens across the U.S. and Canada enter their art and writing for a chance to receive opportunities for recognition, exhibition, and scholarships!

What are the program dates?

The exact program dates for the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards change on a year-by-year basis. Be sure to review the [Calendar](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/calendar/) page for exact information on the current competition season.

In general, the calendar will follow the below schedule:

**Fall**  
Scholastic Awards open for entries

**December–January**  
Deadlines vary by region and can be as early as December 1

**January**  
Regional awards are announced

**March**  
National awards are announced

**June**  
National Medalists are celebrated at the National Ceremony in New York City

**July–August**  
Access to [portal.artandwriting.org](http://portal.artandwriting.org) is restricted

What are the art and writing deadlines?

Entry deadlines range from December to January and vary by region. To find your regional deadline, visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page. You might have different deadlines for art and for writing.

Is there a specific theme a work must address?

There are no pre-defined prompts. Some [scholarships](https://www.artandwriting.org/scholarships) are presented to teens whose work fits a particular theme.

Is it okay if my work has profanity, violence, etc.?

Young artists and writers are free to explore any and all topics. No work is ever disqualified from the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards because of the nature of its content.

What are the entry fees?

Entry fees are $10.00 per individual entry and $30.00 per portfolio entry.

If the entry fee is a barrier to your participation in the Awards, simply select the “fee waiver” option when entering your work in the online portal. If you have received instructions from [your Affiliate](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions) about specific regional fee waiver protocols, please follow them.

If you are able to pay—please do! Your nominal entry fee helps a national community of creative teens participate in this program.

The Awards are presented by the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and its Affiliate Partners. Entry fees support essential operational costs.

Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.

For more guidance on how to complete entry fees, view our [Teen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSVQwKEbwfw&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=4) and [Educator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKj4-nN-Xc) walkthrough videos on submitting payment.

[### Policies (Including AI and Plagiarism)](./#ai-plagiarism-other)

Can AI-generated work be entered into the Scholastic Awards?

The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards acknowledge that many artists and writers are using AI technologies as a tool to engage in the making of original work, and therefore, as of July 1, 2025:

* The Scholastic Awards **permit** the use of AI technologies to aid in the artistic process during the creation of an entered work, such as brainstorming or outlining.
* The Scholastic Awards **do not permit** and will deem ineligible any entered work for which the final product is itself AI-generated.

The Scholastic Awards define ***AI-generated work*** as a work that is automatically created based on prompts or other inputs, with minimal or no human interaction. These types of works do not meet the Scholastic Awards’ standards for originality. **If a teen enters an AI-generated work, we will consider that a violation of our Copyright & Plagiarism Policy and it will be subject to the same consequences.** That is, it will be rejected as ineligible for an award or, if it has been selected for an award and is later determined to be AI-generated, the award will be taken back or canceled.

It is highly encouraged that all artists and writers document their creative process. In the event of a concern over a work’s originality, the ability to provide the Scholastic Awards with documentation of your creative process is hugely beneficial.

As part of the entry process, you will be asked to indicate whether and how you’ve used AI-technologies during the creation of your work. If you’ve used it in accordance with our policy, this will NOT influence your eligibility or chances of winning.

Examples of permissible uses of AI-technology (permissible means that it is allowed):

* Using AI-powered tools to produce ideas, prompts, or suggestions early in the creative process
* Using AI-powered search functions for research purposes
* Using applications and software in which AI-powered features are embedded (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Procreate) to edit or enhance an original work

Examples of impermissible uses of AI-technology (impermissible means that it violates the Scholastic Awards’ originality terms):

* Providing input such as datasets or text prompts to an AI-tool that automatically generates an image or piece of writing as the final product
* Any work for which the artist or writer is unable to demonstrate and articulate their creative decision-making process

Questions to ask yourself if you’re unsure:

* Who made the key artistic and creative decisions—a human, or a machine? Is this my own unique voice and vision?
* Did I apply artistic skills and techniques, and can I articulate them if asked?
* Can I provide the sources for any works cited?
* What could I show as evidence if there are concerns about my work’s originality?
* How does my work compare to something created without the use of technology?
* Would I feel that I am being truthful if my work is recognized for its originality?

What is your plagiarism policy?

All work entered into the Awards must be original, meaning you create the work based on your own ideas. By entering work to the Awards, you agree that you created it and did not copy it from any other person, business, school, or organization. Any work that infringes anyone’s intellectual property rights will be disqualified.

For more information about the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards’ Copyright & Plagiarism policy, review the links below.

[Participation Terms](https://www.artandwriting.org/participation-terms/)

[Copyright & Plagiarism Guide](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/copyright-plagiarism/)

[How to Be Original](https://youtu.be/ocpbHbX2S1E)

Can I enter work that has been previously published, exhibited, or recognized by another program?

Yes, if they do not hold exclusive rights to your work. In the case that your work receives a Scholastic Award, it must be free to use in our publications or exhibitions under the non-exclusive license described in our [participation terms](https://www.artandwriting.org/participation-terms/).

Can I enter my Scholastic Art & Writing Awards entry to another program at the same time?

You may enter the work to other scholarship programs or contests or license it to others for non-exclusive publication. If you plan to enter work to another awards program or publication, review their rules first to confirm that they will not hold exclusive rights to your work.

In the case that your work receives a Scholastic Art & Writing Award, it must be free to use in our publications or exhibitions under the non-exclusive license described in our [participation terms](https://www.artandwriting.org/participation-terms/).

Do I need to submit a consent form from the subject(s) in my work?

You don’t have to submit a consent form. However, you, not the Awards, are responsible for getting any necessary consents or releases from people or for any places or property depicted in your work. By entering work to the Awards, you certify that the work is yours and does not infringe on anyone else’s intellectual property rights.

Why do I grant the Alliance a non-exclusive license to use my work when I enter?

The Alliance is proud to promote the exceptional work of young artists and writers to a wide audience of educators, students, program partners, and the general public through exhibitions, special events, print and online publications, and social media.

To do these things, we need permission from you. The non-exclusive license allows us to use, copy, change, publish, publicly perform, distribute, exhibit, or add to your work without further permission or approval from you as part of our mission to promote creative self-expression among young people.

All displays or publications will attribute you to your work.

This non-exclusive license also means that you can enter the same work you entered into the Awards to other scholarship programs or contests, keep the work in your portfolio, and license it to others for non-exclusive publication.

[### Creating Your Account](./#creating-your-account)

Who can participate in the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards?

To participate in the Awards, you must be a teen in grades 7–12, age 13 and up, and residing in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada.

Can international students apply?

Only teens residing in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada may enter the Awards.

**Boarding Schools:** Teens attending a boarding school located in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada will be automatically assigned to a regional program based on the location of their school.

**Virtual Schools:** Teens must reside in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada to enter the Awards when enrolled in a virtual school. Teens will need a home address in order to apply to a regional program.

**Other Educational Programs:** Teens residing outside of the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada, are not eligible for the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, even if they attend an Other Educational Program in the United States. Other Educational Programs include summer programs, after-school clubs or lessons, private tutoring, pre-college programs, and portfolio review courses.

How do I participate in the Awards?

To participate in the Awards, you must:

1. Create an account by visiting [portal.artandwriting.org](http://portal.artandwriting.org/).
2. Pick a category for your art or writing.
3. Upload your work.
4. Complete payment or fee waiver.

Guidelines and deadlines vary by region. To find your region’s deadline, visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page. You may have a different deadline for art and writing entries.

For additional instructions, visit the [How to Enter](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/) page and view our walkthrough video series on [Navigating Your Scholastic Awards Account](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3).

What information will I need to create an account?

To create your account, you’ll need:

* Your Name
* Date of Birth
* Your Grade
* School Name
* A Valid Email Address

To complete your profile, we’ll ask for:

* Phone Number
* Parent/Guardian Name and Email

We’ll also ask for some additional information, but those fields are not required.

To learn more, view our walkthrough video on [Creating a Teen Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI26XqUd6zA).

Why is an email address required for participation in the Awards?

The Awards will email you important information regarding entry deadlines, award notifications, and additional opportunities. Be sure to enter an email address you check frequently. It might be helpful to use a personal email address, not a school email address, especially if you are graduating soon.

How should I select my school if I am enrolled in an online, virtual school, or other distance learning program?

Teens enrolled in online, virtual schools, or other distance learning programs should add the school to their profile just as they would add any other school. If your primary school is a distance learning program, you will be assigned a region based on your home zip code instead of your school zip code. We want you to be recognized first in your local community.

For more information on selecting your school, view our walkthrough video on [Creating a Teen Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI26XqUd6zA).

I created my work at a program outside of school. Should I enter the school I attend or the program where my work was created?

Teens are required to create an account linking their day school and will be able to add one or more out-of-school programs as an Other Educational Program (OEP) when entering works. The Awards are not in a position to determine what constitutes an OEP because many of the educational spaces in which teens are creating work outside of school are not easily defined.

In our exhibitions, publications, and notifications, we focus on highlighting teens’ demographic information (grade, school’s city, and school’s state) along with their school’s name. OEP names will not be listed, but educators from the OEP can be listed if that is what the teen has requested.

For more guidance on selecting your OEP and educators, view our walkthrough videos on [Uploading Art Work](https://youtu.be/HcxCbMHJKsA?t=34) and [Uploading Writing Work](https://youtu.be/rUXXXDr1c04?t=34).

My school isn’t on the list. What do I do?

Please [contact us](https://www.artandwriting.org/contact) to request to have your school added to our system. Our team will review your request, which will take around five business days to complete. During peak times, it may take longer to process your school request. You will receive an email when your request has been accepted. Do not wait until the deadline to make this request, as we may not be able to complete your request before the deadline has passed.

What is a region?

The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards are divided into regional programs run by local partners—such as museums or universities. These regional partners handle the Awards in a specific area. They collect entry fees, recruit jurors, run judging, and some even put on ceremonies and exhibitions! We couldn’t run the Scholastic Awards without them.

When you create your account, you are automatically put into two regions: one for art and one for writing. You can see what regions you’re in on the homepage of your account or by using our [Region Locator tool](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions).

How are accounts assigned to regional programs?

**Teen** accounts are assigned to a regional program based on their school zip code. Teens who are homeschooled or attend a virtual school are assigned to a regional program based on their home zip code. Teens are never assigned to a regional program based on the zip code of their Other Educational Program.

**Educator** accounts are assigned to a regional program based on the zip code of the organization where they teach (either the school or the Other Educational Program listed in their account). Homeschool and virtual school teachers will be assigned to a regional program based on their home zip code.

I have an account, but I can’t remember my email or password. What do I do?

If you forget your password, click on the “Forgot Password” link on the [login](https://portal.artandwriting.org/sign-in) page.

The account login is always an email address. If your primary email address does not allow you to retrieve your password, please [contact us](https://www.artandwriting.org/contact/) for assistance.

Can I make changes to my profile after the entry deadline has passed?

If you have updates to your profile, including name or address changes, please make those as soon as possible. Changes made to your profile after the entry deadline may not be reflected in awards you may win, but the sooner you make the changes, the more likely it is that we will be able to include them.

[### Uploading Your Work](./#uploading-your-work)

Why am I experiencing technical issues with the portal?

High traffic can cause any platform to slow, lag, or throw errors, and our portal is no exception. We experience extremely high traffic in the final 24 hours leading up to major regional deadlines. This can cause issues in the portal, particularly with creating new accounts, uploading entries, and paying for work. If you don’t know your regional deadline, check it with our [region finder](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions) and plan to **enter** **early**. We do not accept entries through any alternative form, so please plan accordingly.

If you experience technical difficulties, keep trying. Closing other tabs, changing browsers, restarting your computer, and clearing your browser cache may help speed up your portal. Some statuses such as ‘entered for judging’ or ‘parent approved’ may be slow to update. If you have paid for your work and have the receipt(s), please be patient and do not pay a second time.

I missed my deadline, can I still enter my work?

We do not accept entries after the deadline has passed. We realize that some teens run into delays or other upload errors when trying to enter their work—especially near deadlines. Higher traffic to the portal tends to occur during these windows, which can cause delays and upload errors. This is one of the reasons why we always encourage participants to enter as early as possible.

If you were not able to enter your work, and you are still eligible to enter next year, we encourage you to enter when we reopen next fall. There are no requirements for when work has to be created.

Can work be entered as a group collaboration?

Works cannot be entered as a group collaboration. Only one teen will be officially attached to a specific entry; however, you may add collaborator information, such as names, to the Work Sources fields during the work upload process. This includes works in the Film & Animation category.

Please use your best judgment when determining which teen involved in a project enters the work. The teen that enters the work will receive credit if the piece is awarded. A work cannot be entered multiple times by different teens.

We also recommend reaching out to your [regional Affiliate](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions). Attribution for collaborators might vary by region.

I created my work independently. Do I have to list an educator?

You do not need to list an educator when entering your work. However, if you did work with an educator, we highly encourage you to list them so that they receive recognition for their guidance.

For more help on selecting your educators, view our walkthrough videos on [Uploading Art Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujrveZVr30&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=2) and [Uploading Writing Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg5dYSdmvgo&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=3).

Can I re-enter a work that I entered to the Scholastic Awards in a previous year?

Previously awarded works can be re-entered only as part of a portfolio.

Works that did not earn a regional or national award in previous years may be re-entered to individual categories only if they have been edited significantly.

Are there size limitations for entered artwork?

While there are no size limitations for art entries, regional exhibitions may not be able to display oversized works. Check your [region’s guidelines](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions) for details.

What images should I upload for my artwork?

The art categories have different upload requirements. Review each specific category listing for complete details.

For 2D works, show your plans in detail. You may choose to include concept drawings, sketches, material palettes, sections, elevations, site plans, and renderings in your image selection.

For 3D works, which often ask for multiple images, include one image that shows the work from the front at a slight angle against a white or neutral-colored background.

For the remaining images, include one detail shot, an image with a ruler for scale, and an image from the back of the work.

We also recommend taking in-progress photos of entries. While these are not required, they may be requested if an entry is flagged for potential plagiarism or AI violations. For more information, refer to the [Participation Terms](https://www.artandwriting.org/participation-terms/).

What size should my images be?

Uploaded images should have a print resolution of 300 dpi and the file size should be around 3MB–5MB. Upload the best quality image you have.

Are there word limits for writing?

Yes, word limits vary depending on the [category](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/categories/). If your work exceeds the word limit of a category, please enter a shortened version of the work.

How do I enter writing work?

Writing work should be entered into the text box located in the upload section of the entry journey. You can type directly into this field or use copy + paste. Be mindful of your work’s formatting—a work will appear to jurors similar to how it appears in the text box. This is inclusive of features like line breaks or spacing.

We do not allow the submission of PDF documents for writing entries.

Can I make changes to my work after I’ve paid?

Yes! You can edit your work until your regional deadline.

Can I make changes to my work after the entry deadline has passed?

No, teens and educators cannot edit works after the entry deadline.

Can I enter more than one work, enter works to more than one category, or enter both art and writing?

Generally, there is no limit to the number of works you may enter, with the exception of Photography and Portfolio. Each participant is allowed to enter 16 works in the Photography category, and two art and two writing portfolios. The Portfolio category is open to teens in grade 12 only.

Teens may enter different works into multiple categories but are not allowed to enter the same work into more than one category.

Entry guidelines may vary for art and writing in each region. Please visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page to find your regional webpage with specific guidelines and deadlines.

[### Payment](./#payment)

What are the entry fees?

Entry fees are $10.00 per individual entry and $30.00 per portfolio entry.

If the entry fee is a barrier to your participation in the Awards, simply select the “fee waiver” option when entering your work in the online portal. If you have received instructions from [your Affiliate](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions) about specific regional fee waiver protocols, please follow them.

If you are able to pay—please do! Your nominal entry fee helps a national community of creative teens participate in this program.

The Awards are presented by the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and its Affiliate Partners. Entry fees support essential operational costs.

Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.

For more guidance on how to complete entry fees, view our [Teen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSVQwKEbwfw&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=4) and [Educator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKj4-nN-Xc) walkthrough videos on submitting payment.

What should I do if I can’t afford the entry fee?

If the entry fee is a barrier to your participation in the Awards, simply select the “fee waiver” option when entering your work in the online portal. Your entry will then be marked as paid.

Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.

Some policies may vary by region; visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page to find your region.

For more information on entry fees and fee waivers, view our [Teen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSVQwKEbwfw&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=4) and [Educator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKj4-nN-Xc) walkthrough videos on submitting payment.

[### Educators](./#educators)

How can I connect with my students?

Educators can only view students and edit works that have been connected to an educator’s account. Students attach educators to an individual entry on the Basic Information page in the entry process. After this, educators will be able to see the teen on their account and edit the specific work they’re connected to, including adding the upload. Check out our video on [Editing a Student Work from an Educator Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqzGta4wbMM) for further assistance.

I’ve connected with my student, why can’t I see them on my account?

It’s possible you’re viewing the incorrect region in your account. The dropdown menu on the left side of your portal dashboard can be used to switch between regions. This includes switching between your art and writing regions.

Can I connect to all my students if they’re in different regions?

Yes! As long as you and your teen are connected to the same educational program (school or OEP), they are able to assign you as an educator on a work. After they’ve attached you to an entry, their region will appear on the regional dropdown menu in your account. When you select their region, their works and account will appear on your portal. There is no limit to the number of regions you can connect to.

How do I bulk pay for works as an educator?

Educators can bulk pay for entries via the portal. However, payment methods vary according to region.

All educators can pay for multiple works using a credit or debit card. This does not generate an invoice. To do so, please follow the following steps:

1. Go to the **Work** tab of your online portal.
2. Checkmark each work you wish to pay for.
3. Click the change payment button located above the table of works.
4. Select to pay via credit or debit card or select “I qualify for a fee waiver.”
5. If paying via card, you will be brought to Stripe, a third party payment platform.

To pay by check, you will need to generate an invoice. Not all regions accept payment by check. If you do not see the payment option “Invoice (or educator paying by cash, check, etc.)”, then your region does not accept check payment.

If you DO see that option, you can bulk pay via check after generating an invoice. Follow steps 1-3 above and then, instead of selecting credit/debit card, click Invoice. This will give you the option to either generate a new invoice or add works to an already existing one. You can access invoices on the **Invoice** tab of your dashboard.

To remove work from the invoice, click on the invoice number to open the edit page. Use the checkbox to select the works, then select “Remove from Invoice.”

**Important:** As soon as you add an entry to an invoice, it will be marked as paid in the portal. You will still need to print off the invoice and send it, along with payment, to your regional Affiliate.

Be sure to check out our video on [how to pay as an educator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKj4-nN-Xc&list=PLirxWhcIrkT5vHvKBEiMoDKZRb7umAI0i&index=4).

How can I edit work as an educator?

Educators can only view students and edit works that have been connected to your account. Your student will need to go into their account and connect you to either a new or existing entry. After this, you’ll be able to see the teen on your account and edit the work, including adding the upload! On the **Work** tab of the portal, click on the pencil icon located next to the work you want to edit.

Check out our video on [Editing a Student Work from an Educator Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqzGta4wbMM) for further assistance.

I have a student I don’t recognize, or work I need to recuse myself from.

Educators can recuse themselves from a student’s entry, and sever that connection, by going to the **Works** section of their portal; selecting the entry in question; then editing the first section, **General Information>School and Educator Information**. If your student selected the wrong educator from your school, and you see the correct one on the list, you can choose that new educator. Otherwise, select “I did not find my educator”.

Once you save this change, you will no longer be associated with this entry, and no longer be able to edit or view it. This action must be taken per entry, and can only be done before your regional deadline.

I teach at multiple schools, do I need multiple accounts?

You do not need multiple accounts. Educators can connect to multiple schools and/or “Other Educational Programs” in the portal, even if these schools and programs are in different regions.

If you have multiple accounts from previous years, please reach out at [artandwriting.org/contact](https://artandwriting.org/contact) to request that duplicate accounts be deleted. To prevent students from connecting to an incorrect account while you wait for deletion, we recommend changing your name in the **Profile** section of the account(s) to avoid confusion.

Are educators required to create an account?

We strongly encourage all educators to create a Scholastic Art & Writing Awards account, though they are not required to do so. Educators with accounts have the ability to edit, view, and monitor the progress of their participants online.

We also use educator accounts to distribute materials, such as medals, to the educators of National Medalists.

Educators of National Medalists will not be able to reserve National Ceremony tickets or receive their educator award if they do not have an account.

For guidance on creating and navigating an educator account, [view our walkthrough video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirxWhcIrkT5vHvKBEiMoDKZRb7umAI0i).

As an educator, can I waive the entry fees for my class?

Educators can indicate they would like an entry’s fee waived on the payment page of their portal account. We recommend that educators make sure their students are aware of the easy fee waiver option, so they can make the determination for themselves.

When teens are able to pay, they are encouraged to do so. Nominal entry fees help a national community of creative teens participate in this program. The Awards are presented by the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and its Affiliate Partners. Entry fees support essential operational costs.

Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.

Some policies may vary by region; visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page to find your region.

For more guidance on entry fees and fee waivers, view our [Teen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSVQwKEbwfw&list=PLirxWhcIrkT6V63Rx1OMDsgdFzvxViRv3&index=4) and [Educator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKj4-nN-Xc) walkthrough videos on submitting payment.

[### Regional Awards](./#regional-awards)

When will I find out if I won a regional award?

To check when regional award recipients will be announced, review our [calendar page](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/calendar/).  Some regions announce their winners earlier, so please check with your local regional partners. To find your local regional partner, visit the [My Region](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) page.

What are the regional awards?

Gold Key, Silver Key, Honorable Mention, American Visions Nominee, and American Voices Nominee.

Is receiving a regional award prestigious to colleges and universities?

Yes! Your Scholastic Art & Writing Award is an achievement, and many colleges will take your Award into consideration when determining admissions and scholarships. Be sure to mention it on your college application or resume.

If I receive an award at the regional level, will my work be exhibited or published?

Regional programs determine which works are included in their exhibitions and publications. Please contact your [regional program](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) for more information.

What Scholastic Awards materials will I receive for my regional award?

All recipients of regional awards (Gold Keys, Silver Keys, Honorable Mentions, and American Vioces & Visions Nominees) can download a digital certificate and an official Letter of Awards through their online account. Distribution of additional materials varies depending on your region. [Visit your local program’s webpage](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) to learn more.

I received a Gold Key. What happens to my work now?

Gold Key works automatically advance to national judging. National jurors review Gold Key works from across the country.

Review our [calendar](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/calendar/) for information on announcement dates.

Are teens who earn regional awards eligible to receive scholarships?

Regional scholarship opportunities vary. Check your [region’s](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) webpage to learn about potential scholarships or award opportunities.

In addition to regional scholarship opportunities, teens in grades 7–11 who receive a Gold or Silver Key may be eligible for a Scholastic Awards Summer (SAS) Scholarship to attend an art or writing program over the summer. Go to our [Summer Scholarships](https://www.artandwriting.org/scholarships/summer-scholarships/) page for more information.

Gold Key works are also automatically considered for National Medals and sponsored scholarships.

When will I find out if I received a national award?

Review our [calendar](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/calendar/) for information on announcement dates.

National awards include Gold Medal, Silver Medal, Gold Medal Portfolio, Silver Medal Portfolio, Honorable Mention Portfolio, American Voices & Visions Award, the Best-in-Grade Award, The Flaunt-It Award, The Herblock Award for Editorial Cartoon, and the New York Life Award.

What do teens receive if they earn a National Medal?

Review our [calendar](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/calendar/) for information on program dates.

[### Scholarships](./#scholarships)

What is a sponsored scholarship award?

The sponsored scholarships are awards that highlight work that aligns with certain themes or content. Review our [scholarship page](https://www.artandwriting.org/scholarships) for more information.

How do I apply for a sponsored scholarship?

The process for applying for sponsored scholarships is the same as for regular entries. In the participant’s account, there is a step in the work entry process titled *Cash Awards*. Here, the participant can click a checkbox indicating which scholarship they want their work to be considered for and enter a personal statement on why they are applying (50 words minimum). The entry deadline for scholarships is the same as the deadline in your region.

For more guidance on applying for sponsored scholarships, view our walkthrough videos on [Uploading Artwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujrveZVr30) and [Uploading Writing Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg5dYSdmvgo).

What is a Scholastic Awards Summer Scholarship?

Scholastic Awards Summer (SAS) scholarships are need- and merit-based tuition scholarships for teens in grades 7–11 who received a Gold or Silver Key.

Teens do not apply for specific summer programs; instead, they apply for a SAS Scholarship and we work with our partners to place students into a program that will work best based on their availability, location, and interests.

Not all teens who apply will receive a SAS Scholarship, so we encourage participants to also apply to other programs and opportunities when making their summer plans.

Go to our [Summer Scholarships](https://www.artandwriting.org/scholarships/summer-scholarships/) page for more information.

[### Portfolios](./#portfolios)

How do I apply for a portfolio scholarship?

Seniors can apply for portfolio scholarships through their online dashboard. On the entry page of their account, there is an option to create a individual entry or a portfolio entry. All completed portfolio entries are automatically considered for scholarship. There are no further steps required.

Portfolio scholarships are for graduating seniors only.

How do I choose which works to include in my art or writing portfolio?

Teens should enter works that best exemplify originality, skill, and the emergence of a personal vision or voice. These works should demonstrate versatility, diversity in techniques and styles, and a developed, cohesive voice or vision.

Please read the [category descriptions](https://www.artandwriting.org/awards/how-to-enter/categories/) for specific portfolio entry criteria. For more guidance and advice from jurors, view our [Art Portfolio Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YoZrKP4K7Q) and [Writing Portfolio Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmUAEkLNVsM&t=4s).

Can I enter both a portfolio and works in individual categories?

Yes, teens may enter a work to both portfolio and individual categories. To enter a work that is part of a portfolio, you will need to create a separate individual entry for the piece. The Portfolio category is only available to participants in grade 12.

Can a portfolio entry include a variety of media (paintings, photographs, video clips) or genre (poetry, short story, personal essay)?

Portfolio entries consist of six works that can come from one category or any combination of multiple categories. Art portfolios may only contain works from art categories, and writing portfolios are limited to writing categories. Teens may enter two art portfolios and two writing portfolios, but all works must be unique. The same work cannot be entered in multiple portfolios.

How do you determine which teens receive scholarships for portfolios?

Portfolios are judged without knowledge of the participant’s gender, age, or hometown by artists and industry professionals. The top-ranking portfolios are then presented to a scholarship committee, which awards sixteen $12,500 Gold Medal Portfolio scholarships (eight writing and eight art). Additional $2,000 scholarships are given to students earning Silver Medal Portfolios.

The committee consists of Alliance staff, board members, and national partners. The committee will review the personal statements that were submitted in addition to the six works. They consider a number of factors that combine the recognition of talent and the representation of diverse mediums, viewpoints, and backgrounds of Award recipients when selecting scholarship recipients.

[### Exhibitions and Publications](./#exhibitions-publications)

How long will the Alliance hold on to my artwork?

The Alliance is dedicated to showcasing student work and raising awareness about the incredible talent, originality, and voice of teens through traveling exhibitions and special events. One way we accomplish this is through an extensive calendar of events, which includes the National Exhibition in New York City and the National Touring Exhibition (locations vary)

Works that are selected may be held for up to two years. This takes into account the timing of these events and the delivery and receipt of the work, as well as its photographing and/or framing.

When will my artwork be returned?

Regional Exhibitions: Please contact your [Affiliate Partner](https://www.artandwriting.org/regions/) regarding art return from a regional exhibition.

National Exhibition: National Medal works may be requested and held by the national office of the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers for up to **two years** for additional exhibition possibilities. The work will be returned to the participant’s home address, so please notify us if you move.

Note that if the Alliance is not able to return physical works to a participant for any reason, we may hold the work up to three years from the date of the national award notification. If the work is not retrieved, we may continue to store the physical work, donate it, or destroy it.

If I earn a National Medal, will my artwork be exhibited?

A selection of works by National Medalists will be included in the National Exhibition in New York City. The exhibition includes works that received an American Voices & Visions Award, Gold Medal Portfolio Award, Silver Medal Portfolio Award, Gold Medal Award, and/or sponsored scholarship awards. We can’t exhibit works that are oversized or that are shipped from an international address. Due to space limitations, we are not able to exhibit the works of all Medalists.

If I earn a National Medal, will my work be published?

A selection of National Medalist works will be included in the [Awards’ publications of teen art and teen writing](https://www.flipsnack.com/artandwriting/). Participants are notified when their work is published and will receive a copy of the publication in which their work appears.

If your work receives a National Medal and you do not want it to be displayed in our gallery or in publications, please [contact us](https://www.artandwriting.org/contact/) and mention the title and category of your work.
