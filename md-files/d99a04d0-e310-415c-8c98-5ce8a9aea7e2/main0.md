# Wall Street 101

## Five Courses Available for Summer 2026

Bentley University’s Wall Street 101 Program is a competitive experiential learning program for rising high school juniors and seniors interested in finance. We offer courses on personal finance, stock valuation and investment research, FinTech and Macroeconomics. Led by Bentley faculty with industry expertise, the program includes small classes, interactive simulations, policy debates and presentations by Wall Street professionals. Students gain hands-on experience valuing stocks, bonds and other assets using industry-standard databases and learn about financial technology's impact on the industry and the art and science of human psychology shaping our investment decisions.

In addition to lectures, students work in teams to prepare stock pitches, analyze investment strategies, participate in macroeconomic simulations and policy debates, and work on entrepreneurial strategies involving FinTech and artificial intelligence (AI). Students attending courses on our beautiful campus will gain hands-on experience with industry-standard databases such as Bloomberg, FactSet and the Financial Trading System in our world-class trading room.
