The UT San Antonio Citymester Program is a student engagement initiative developed by the Honors College. Through Citymester, the University of Texas at San Antonio and community partners work together to educate our future leaders using internships, service-learning projects, and networking opportunities. The program provides selected students a summer of engaged learning outside the classroom. Students will work with non-profits, businesses, and other agencies in San Antonio to gain valuable career skills to supplement their education.

Students do not have to be members of the Honors College to participate in Citymester!  
  
***For questions about the Citymester Program, email [HonorsSpecialPrograms@utsa.edu](mailto:HonorsSpecialPrograms@utsa.edu).***

## Program Details

**City Skills: (3 hours)** City Skills is the Internship component of Citymester. Placements are based on student career interests and a match-making process with current and new partners. Through the internships, students and community partners work together to strengthen our local businesses and institutions.

**City Solutions: (3 hours)** City Solutions is the service learning component of Citymester. This is an opportunity for students to work with civic or non-profit partners to identify and develop solutions to improve our community. Students have an active role in serving the community and developing city solutions.

**City Sites: (3 hours)** The community becomes the classroom in this upper-division, interdisciplinary seminar. San Antonio’s key institutions and landmarks host students for classes and unique opportunities to connect with city leaders in government, industry, and philanthropy.

## Mitchell Foster

Mitchell Foster, an environmental science major, had the opportunity to intern with the San Antonio Zoo and complete a service project at the Cibolo Creek Nature Preserve during his Citymester experience. He worked with various bird species and learned how to care for them and their environments at the zoo, and helped upkeep environmentally friendly landscaping and assisted with public education programs at the Cibolo Creek Nature Preserve. His participation in Citymester helped make him a strong candidate for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Hollings Scholarship/Internship program, which he was selected for in Spring 2024.

## Common Questions

Will this count towards my major?

If you are a member of the Honors college, you will receive credits. There is a possibility that you can receive credit in your major. Once accepted to the program, email your academic advisor and CC [Kristi Meyer](mailto:kristi.meyer@utsa.edu) regarding credits.

Can I take other courses while doing Citymester?

We don't recommend adding classes to the 9 CM hours. However, if you must add classes, contact us to discuss how this could impact your ability to successfully complete Citymester.

What are my responsibilities prior to the program's start?

Selected Citymester students are required to attend workshops and Citymester orientation before they begin City Skills, City Solutions, and City Sites. Attendance at orientation by the UT San Antonio Honors College is mandatory.
