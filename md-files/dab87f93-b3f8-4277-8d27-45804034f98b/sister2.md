  UTSA Citymester Program

#### Our **internship partners** offer a micro internship of 150 hour during the summer semester (June - August) . As a Citymester internship partner, you're helping to expose our high-achieving students to the growing opportunities in San Antonio as well as helping them to develop a skillset in a given area. This component of the program is called City Skills. Our **service partners** provide students with 75-hour projects during the Summer semester. It's imperative to note that our students are expected to do more than just fulfill volunteer hours. This component of the program is called City Solutions because students work individually or in a group to work with local nonprofits as they develop solutions to some of San Antonio's social and environmental issues.

Students receive college credit hours and a grade for both the City Skills and City Solutions experience. They are also expected to participate in poster presentations at the end of the term where they discuss key learning outcomes achieved, skills gained, and impact made throughout the team.
