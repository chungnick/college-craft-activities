Design and build your own “smart” devices this summer at NYU!

Computer Engineering for Good is a two-week program designed to teach high school students the basic principles and skills needed to create innovative applications for internet-connected technologies that address global challenges.

The Computer Engineering for Good program redefines “solution” by focusing on the ways computers and engineering can be applied to address the disparity. Students will go through the process of analyzing real-world problems specifically using developing world technologies and then use Computer and Electrical engineering skills to implement a viable innovative “solution” that can ensure sustainability. During the program, students will have lessons on aspects of design conception all the way through implementation.

## Coursework

Computer Engineering for Good focuses students on engineering "embedded systems" applications that support societal goals around sustainability, climate change and global public health. Students will learn to use ideas from robotics, remote sensing, AI, computational analytics, cloud computing, engineering design and wireless communications to gather, transmit and process critical information. By creating their own internet-connected devices on various microcontroller platforms (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) participants will learn how to think critically to implement an efficient solution to social challenges that consider everything from size, cost, power consumption and more.

## How to Apply

Eligible applicants will be high school students currently enrolled in grades 8, 9, 10, or 11. Competitive applicants will have a strong academic record and demonstrated interest in technology and design.

To apply, submit the online application, which includes the following components:

* Questions related to your personal and academic information
* High school transcript
* Four Short Essay Responses
* International students are required to submit proof of English language proficiency

## Student Life

**Computer Engineering for Good** is an in-person program that will be taught at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering on our campus in Brooklyn, New York. Students may elect to live on campus in one of our residence halls along with other high school program students, or may commute to class each day. Classes and time to work collaboratively on projects will take place Monday-Through Friday between 9 am and 4 pm.

Outside of class, students can take advantage of on-campus activities and events organized for NYU’s summer high school students, where they can connect with students from around the world that share their academic interests and intellectual curiosity. Students can also take advantage of organized field trips to NYC attractions, like Broadway, Yankee Stadium, and museums.
