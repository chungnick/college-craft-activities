# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### CE4G: The Computer Engineering for Good program redefines “solution” by focusing on the ways computers and engineering can be applied to address the disparity. Students will go through the process of analyzing real-world problems specifically using developing world technologies and then use Computer and Electrical engineering skills to implement a viable innovative “solution” that can ensure sustainability. During the program, students will have lessons on aspects of design conception all the way through implementation.

###### Create embedded systems applications

###### Work with Arduino and Raspberry Pi

###### Learn about sustainability and public health

###### Develop critical thinking skills

### Learn to build sustainable technology solutions for global challenges through computer and electrical engineering

> "This program has opened my eyes to the world of computer engineering. It sparked an interest in me that I hope to pursue as a career. It’s amazing to see the possibilities even with a limited knowledge of computer engineering and how much can be accomplished!"

- 2023 Cohort Student

# STUDENT TESTIMONIALS

> "I think a big takeaway from CE4G was realizing that high school students like me can create meaningful products that make a difference. I used to think health-related technology was out of reach, but this program inspired me and taught me that it’s possible to take an idea far."

- 2023 Cohort Student

# STUDENT TESTIMONIALS

> "Participating in the Computer Engineering for Good program has motivated me to create projects on my own that can one day benefit society. Learning C++ and working with microcontrollers showed me how engineering can make a real-world impact."

# STUDENT TESTIMONIALS

# Meet Our Mentors

##### Computer Engineering for Good is created and supervised by Professor Matthew Campisi from Tandon's Electrical and Computer Engineering department. The topics are drawn from Prof Campisi's undergraduate course in embedded systems and his experience developing low-cost, high-social-impact medical devices.
