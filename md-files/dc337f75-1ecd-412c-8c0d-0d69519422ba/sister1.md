# Apply for Stamps Eminence

*In keeping with the mission of the Stamps Eminence Scholarship Program, the selection committee looks for students who have demonstrated potential as academic scholars and leaders both inside and outside the classroom. Applicants should be driven to excel and be interested in the support of a small community of peers.*

Eligibility and Criteria

* U.S. citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply.
* Students are selected based on outstanding potential and all majors are encouraged to apply. There is no "typical" Stamps Eminence Scholar.

Applicants are evaluated on the following criteria:

### Academics

* Robust curriculum and strong GPA
* Top 10% (and above) class rank
* Curiosity as demonstrated by research or equivalent experiences
* Official ACT or SAT scores

### Service

* Demonstrated commitment to a cause, program, issue, or idea
* Demonstrated commitment to improving life for others

### Communication

* Written expression through essays (Common Application and Stamps Eminence)
* Video introduction through a 2-minute YouTube link

### Additional consideration will be given to:

* Service that extends beyond high school organizations and clubs
* Leadership that threads through academics and service
* Depth and breadth in involvement, experiences, and leadership
* Collaborative spirit and teamwork-inspired experience

## How to Apply

1. Applicants must apply to the university by the **November 1** early action deadline. When completing the Ohio State admissions application, applicants must indicate their interest in the [**University Honors Program**](https://honors-scholars.osu.edu/honors) **or** [**Ohio State Scholars Program**](https://honors-scholars.osu.edu/scholars).
   1. *Note: All students that receive the Stamps Eminence Scholarship must be Honors students. If a student has applied for the Ohio State Scholars program and the Stamp Eminence Scholarship Program and is selected as a finalist for the Stamps Eminence program, they will be moved into the Honors program.*
2. Within 1-5 days, the applicant will receive an email that acknowledges Ohio State's receipt of the student's admission application and provides a unique Ohio State username (lastname.#), along with instructions on activating this username and setting up a password.
3. Applicants must then complete and submit the Stamps Eminence application by the **Monday, November 10, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. EST** deadline. The applicant's Ohio State username and password are required to apply. The applicant does not need to wait for an Ohio State's admission decision to submit the Stamps Eminence application.

### Components of the Stamps Eminence Application

There are two components of the Stamps Eminence Application:

1. Stamps Eminence Essay
2. Video Introduction (via an ***unlisted***YouTube link)

The Scholarship Selection Committee will have access to the student's Common Application and consider it in the selection process, along with other submitted Ohio State application materials. 

### Finalist Interview and Event

Following the application review process, a select number of applicants will be named as finalists. All finalists will be interviewed via a virtual platform during the months of January and February. Finalists are **required** to participate in the Stamps Eminence Finalist Friday event, which is scheduled for Friday, **February 27, 2026**. This full-day, in-person immersive event will provide a glimpse of the Stamps Eminence experience and will include special department visits and various group activities that precede a special finalist reception that evening.

### Requirements of the Program

To remain in good standing as a Stamps Eminence Scholar, students are required to:

* Gain admission to the University Honors Program and maintain [Honors status](https://honors-scholars.osu.edu/future-students/honors/standards) every semester.
* Demonstrate a commitment to “giving back” through [community engagement](https://honors-scholars.osu.edu/eminence/community-impact) options.
* Complete either an Honors thesis which could lead to a graduating *with Honors Research Distinction*, or other capstone/culminating project.
* Contribute to and be fully engaged with the Stamps Eminence Program through required program events and leadership opportunities.
