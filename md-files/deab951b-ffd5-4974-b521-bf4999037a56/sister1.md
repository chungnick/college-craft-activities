### 3. Upload a 3-5 minute introduction video

As part of your LiftOff application, we ask for a short video introduction. This is just a chance for us to get to know *you* in whatever way feels comfortable.

You can simply talk to the camera, show us around your classroom, narrate over photos, or even keep your face off-camera if you prefer. We’re looking for authenticity, not perfection.

Some ideas:

* Walk us through your classroom or a favorite student project
* Tell us why you’re excited about space, STEM, or joining LiftOff
* Share a fun teaching moment or what inspires your students

Keep it casual (1–3 minutes is great) — we’re not judging video quality or editing skills. Just be yourself!
