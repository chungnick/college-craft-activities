Take that leap with Imagine Cup. Refine your product-market fit for leading organizations and unlock new growth through Microsoft's trusted AI and global ecosystem.

Join the Scale path and take your solution to the world stage.

  

### Prizing:

## Launch

You're building something with real potential, and the Launch path will help you take it further.  
  
Build momentum, sharpen your vision, and prepare for growth. If you're developing an AI-powered solution, have not received any amount of dilutive funding, or no more than $100,000 USD in external, non-dilutive funding, Launch gives you the guidance and resources to move forward. Whether you've built a prototype, tested an Minimum Viable Product (MVP), or are still refining your direction, this is where ideas become market ready.  
  
Join the Launch path and position your work for the global community.
