## Get Started

How do I register for the competition?

Visit the [Imagine Cup](/) homepage and click 'Register now' to sign up for the competition. Once you have registered, you will be able to see the competition on your account page. All team members will need to create an account and register.

Who is eligible to participate in the Imagine Cup?

Participants must be at least 18 years old as of September 30, 2025; an enrolled student at an accredited educational institution between September 30, 2025, and May 31, 2026, and from a country not prohibited by U.S. export regulations.
Mentors are not considered team members for the purpose of this competition. Please see the  [rules and regulations](https://aka.ms/icrulesregs)  for full eligibility criteria.

I have graduated from college. May I participate?

All team members must be enrolled students at an accredited educational institution that grants high-school or college/university (or equivalent) degrees (including home schools) at any time between September 30, 2025 and May 31, 2026.

Can I compete if I’ve competed in the Imagine Cup in the past?

Yes, we understand your journey is evolving, and if you are not a previous world champion, we welcome you to submit a solution to the 2026 competition.

Can I submit more than one entry and/or be on more than one team?

Each competitor may only belong to one team within the competition. You may only submit one entry per round. If you make multiple submissions, we will use the last one you submitted as your official entry.

How do I review my profile and account information?

Navigate to your Imagine Cup [account page](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/Account) to review your account details, check the status of your registration and submissions, and [manage your team](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/Account/Teams).

Should I apply if I am just getting started on my journey and don’t have a team yet, but want to learn?

Absolutely! We encourage all students who are interested to apply.

What is the difference between the Scale and Launch paths?

From startups with real traction to early-stage builders, Imagine Cup offers two distinct paths to help you grow.
Scale
If you’ve already secured users, revenue, or capital— and you have not received more than $5,000,000 USD in combined dilutive or external, non-dilutive funding – the Scale track is for you. You’ll focus on refining product-market fit and preparing to scale your solution into leading organizations. Top 3 Scale teams will secure their spot at the World Championship.
Launch
If you're developing an AI-powered solution but not yet ready for Scale, the Launch track helps you take the next step. Whether you’ve built a prototype, tested an MVP, or are validating your market fit, this track gives you the support to grow with clarity and confidence. Eligible teams have not received any amount of dilutive funding or have secured no more than $100,000 USD in external, non-dilutive funding. Launch winner will be announced after semifinals.

What is the difference between dilutive and non-dilutive funding?

Dilutive funding involves giving up a percentage of ownership in the company in exchange for capital. Non-dilutive funding does not require giving up any equity. Examples include grants, loads, and revenue-based financing.

What are the categories?

Choose a category that inspires you or create your own. The challenge is yours to define.
Education
AI is transforming how institutions design and deliver education, helping teachers save time, students stay engaged, and outcomes improve at scale.
Financial Services
From mobile wallets to fraud detection, AI is changing how financial institutions operate, making services faster, safer, and more accessible.
Health and Life Sciences
Healthcare is becoming more connected, with AI supporting faster diagnoses, accelerating research, and helping clinicians deliver better outcomes.
Retail and Consumer Goods
From supply chain to storefront, agentic AI is redefining how brands anticipate needs, optimize inventory, and create more personalized experiences.
Cybersecurity
As organizations become more digital and distributed, security shifts from being a basic safeguard to a strategic, AI-driven advantage.

How do I indicate if my team wants to participate in the Scale or Launch path?

When you submit your MVP you will be asked to choose either the Scale or Launch path

Are the categories the same in both Scale and Launch paths?

Yes.

Does my solution have to fit into one of the categories?

No. This year’s five categories highlight urgent challenges and opportunities for ingenuity. They are meant to inspire, not limit.

What if I already have an existing startup?

You are eligible to compete in the Scale path if you/your business has not received more than $5,000,000 USD in combined dilutive or external, non-dilutive funding. If you/your business has not received any dilutive funding and if you/your business has not received external, non-dilutive funding of more than $100,000 USD, you may choose to compete in either the Scale or Launch path. For full eligibility criteria for both paths, please check the  [rules and regulations.](

Can additional students assist with the project?

You may receive assistance with your solution from additional students in specific disciplines beyond the four registered members of your official team and/or from a mentor (typically from academic institutions, not-for profit organizations, or private companies). Additional students and mentors are not considered team members for the purposes of the competition [rules and regulations](https://aka.ms/icrulesregs).
