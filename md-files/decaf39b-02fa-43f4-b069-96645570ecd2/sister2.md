# Two Paths. One Goal: Build What Matters.

Imagine Cup offers two tailored paths, Scale and Launch, to meet student founders where they are. Whether you’re gaining traction or just starting to grow, you’ll build with Microsoft AI technologies and advance with expert mentorship, resources, and global community.

[Choose your path and start building](/category/register/33)

### Two paths to the top

From startups with real traction to early-stage builders, Imagine Cup offers two distinct paths to help you grow. Each path rewards standout teams with game-changing opportunities.

## Scale

### For student-led startups with traction.

If you’ve already secured users, revenue, or capital— whether through any amount of dilutive funding or no more than $5,000,000 USD in combined dilutive or external, non-dilutive funding—the Scale track is for you. You’ll focus on refining product-market fit and preparing to scale your solution into leading organizations. Top 3 Scale teams will secure their spot at the World Championship.

### Prizing:

* $100,000 USD\*
* Private mentorship session with Microsoft Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella
* Opportunities for deeper partnership with Microsoft for Startups.

## Launch

### For early-stage student teams building with potential.

If you're developing an AI-powered solution but not yet ready for Scale, the Launch track helps you take the next step. Whether you’ve built a prototype, tested an MVP, or are validating your market fit, this track gives you the support to grow with clarity and confidence. Eligible teams have not received any amount of dilutive funding, or have secured no more than $100,000 USD in external, non-dilutive funding. Winner announced after Semifinals.

### Prizing:

* $50,000 USD\*
* Continued visibility and support from Microsoft

### Make tech matter where it counts most

From classrooms to clinics, bank branches to retail aisles, and every connected device in between

— AI is reshaping the way industries work.

#### Student Hub: power your path to MVP submission

Explore expert-led training and resources designed to help you harness Microsoft AI capabilities, migrate to Azure, sharpen your edge and prepare your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for submission. Whether you’re advancing your vision in Scale or building momentum in Launch, these materials give you the knowledge and tools to accelerate your journey.

#### Builder Series: level up for the semifinals

Semifinalists gain exclusive access to learning and resources designed to take your startup from promising to business-ready. Through the Builder Series, semifinalist teams receive targeted training, mentorship from Microsoft experts, and powerful tools to refine, strengthen, and prepare for the next stage of competition.

#### World Championship: the final stage

The top Scale teams from around the globe take the stage to pitch their AI-powered startups to a panel of industry leaders and global audiences. With visibility, life-changing prizes, and the Imagine Cup trophy on the line, this is where student startups prove their place among the best.
