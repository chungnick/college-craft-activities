High School Honors Science, Math and Engineering Program

## Welcome to HSHSP

### **Regrettably, there will be no HSHSP taking place in the summer of 2026.**

Welcome to the website for the Michigan State University High School Honors Science/Mathematics/Engineering Program (HSHSP). I ([Gail Richmond](/search/Formview.aspx?email=gailr@msu.edu)) am pleased to have served as Director of this outstanding research program since 1988. Its purpose is to provide students from across the U.S. and territories who are entering 12th grade with the opportunity to engage in intensive research work over a seven-week period and to interact with peers who come from diverse backgrounds but who share a love of science and/or mathematics.

## What is HSHSP?

The Michigan State University High School Honors Science/Engineering/Mathematics Program (HSHSP) is a seven-week, intensive summer research program designed for motivated students from across the United States who wish to gain more experience conducting research while living on the campus of a major research-intensive university.

## 

## History and Tradition

The HSHSP is the oldest, continuously running program of its kind in the U.S., having been established in 1958 as a hands-on science enrichment program for local high school students and, over time, developing into a national, highly selective residential program offering research apprenticeships in the life sciences. Since 1989, the HSHSP has offered research opportunities in all areas of science, engineering, and mathematics.

## Program Goals

The HSHSP provides its participants with a unique opportunity to “live and breathe” research in a university environment. Its goals are not only to educate individuals about the research process but to provide the right kind of social context for such knowledge and expertise to flourish. Our goal is not to produce award-winning projects (which often happens, I am pleased to note), but to provide opportunities to enrich one’s knowledge about intellectual work in science and mathematics and to make new and, hopefully, lasting friendships.

### Application information

Join us for the sixty-third annual High School Honors Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Program at Michigan State University (HSHSP). HSHSP gives students the opportunity to engage in intensive research work over a seven-week period and to interact with peers who come from diverse backgrounds but who share a love of science, engineering and/or mathematics.

### Our alumni continue to excel

HSHSP alumni have received recognition for their research work in the form of awards in competitions and publications; all have gone on to college at such institutions as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Cal Tech, Brown, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Duke, University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon, UNC, and many others. Most have majored in a science or science-related field, and most have gone on to graduate or professional schools.
