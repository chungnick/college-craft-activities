# Application Process

## Eligibility

* Medicine is a rewarding and demanding profession that requires dedication, academic excellence, and a genuine passion for patient care — all qualities we look for in our students.
* Applicants are **strongly encouraged to complete a high school biology course** prior to enrolling. The program is open to **rising high school juniors, seniors, and undergraduate premedical students**.
* Applicants must be **16 years of age or older by the session start date**.

## How to Apply

1. Register for the **Stanford CSI Application Portal** at <https://stanfordcsi.slideroom.com>, beginning **November 1, 2025** for Summer Sessions and **May 1, 2026** for the Fall Intensive. (Registration for a SlideRoom account is required.)
2. Complete the online application and all document submissions via the **Stanford CSI Application Portal**.
3. Upload transcripts (two full academic years) from middle school, high school, or college; unofficial copies are acceptable.
4. Upload a current resume. Please include an estimate of hours spent participating in each activity, club, or job.
5. Upload score reports for the **PSAT, SAT or ACT**. This is required for all **U.S.-based students**. If you have not yet taken one of these exams, you will have the opportunity to provide an explanation within the application. Lack of test scores will not automatically disqualify you.
6. Complete the essay prompt(s).
7. Request (via the online application) a **letter of recommendation from a recent teacher**. A **STEM teacher is required**. An email request will be sent to your teacher as part of the CSI application process through the Stanford CSI Application Portal. Your application will not be considered complete until the letter is received. Recommenders have **7 days after the application deadline** to complete the web form. Technical concerns can be directed to **[stanfordmedcsi@stanford.edu](mailto:stanfordmedcsi@stanford.edu)**.
8. Submit the required **application fee** online via credit card.

[**Fee Waivers** (Summer Sessions only)](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/019a2bcca08370dd845b7ecc7ced649e):  
U.S. citizens and permanent residents with a household income under $80,000 annually, or who are enrolled in a program that supports low-income families, may request an application fee waiver using [this form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/019a2bcca08370dd845b7ecc7ced649e). Waivers are limited and granted on a **first-come, first-served basis**.
