# Access DU

[Admission & Aid](/admission-aid)

[Explore this Section](#)

#### Access DU is a core component of the University of Denver's commitment to diversity, inclusiveness and college access. Our Undergraduate Admission summer program brings together high-achieving rising high school juniors and seniors from across the country for a transformative experience on DU's campus.

There is no racial or ethnic prerequisite to participate in the program. All are welcome to apply!

**The Access DU application window for 2025 has now closed. Check back in January 2026 for information and the application for the 2026 program.**

Access DU provides students from all over the United States with the opportunity to connect, reflect, and grow together with the support of DU staff, current students and faculty. We design three engaging days of programming to facilitate an impactful experience that:

* [Enriches participants' cultural competency](#)

  You'll gain exposure to Black, Latinx, Native & Indigenous, and Asian & Pacific Islander faculty and professionals, strengthen your understanding of intersectionality, and feel empowered through greater cultural awareness and active engagement with diverse experiences. Our speakers and programming will help you consider what it means to occupy your different identities through the systems of inequality and privilege we all navigate in the United States.
* [Empowers emerging leaders](#)

  Access DU exisits to help participating students grow and function as leaders in their communities. You will learn about a variety of leadership styles and skills, and practice finding and enacting your own abilities as a young leader through presentations, exercises, and/or workshops.
* [Promotes college access](#)

  With a team of DU admission staff ready to help, we will provide you with college process support and application insight. We will share guidance about completing your college application and help you understand the entire admission process through interactive case studies. You will develop the tools you need to make informed decisions about your educational goals including what to look for in a college and how to write your college essays.
* [Ignites a service-oriented spirit](#)

  We are motivated by the hope that students will enact the growth they experience through our program into their communities. During your time on campus with Access DU, you will develop important skills in leadership and cultural competency that you can apply within your community to build solidarity and make a difference.

### Benefits of Access DU

* Engaging discussion promoting cultural competency, leadership, college access, and service to community
* Continued communication and support throughout the college search and application process
* Build one's resume and social circle of influence
* As an Access DU Scholar, we'll waive your $65 application fee if you choose to apply for college at DU
* Depending on financial need, Access DU participants who successfully complete the program may receive a Pathways Scholarship worth up to $7,500 per year, renewable for four years at DU

### Getting ready for Access DU

* [Who can apply to Access DU?](#)

  Rising seniors and juniors (class of 2026 and 2027) who are US citizens, permanent residents, undocumented students, or DACA\* recipients are all eligible to apply for the program.

  Access DU provides participants with the opportunity to connect with college admission counselors, peers and other experts who can help you understand and navigate the college application and admission process. This could be especially helpful if you're a first-generation college student, from a small town or rural area, come from a low-income family, or represent a historically underrepresented background on college campuses. But regardless of your background, we encourage you to apply!

  \***Disclaimer:** Please note that the program takes place in-person at the University of Denver and travel will be required to attend.
* [How much does the program cost?](#)

  There is no charge to attend Access DU; DU will cover costs associated with your participation during the program.

  If you are interested in being considered for a travel stipend, please be sure to indicate this on your application.

  **Note:** Travel stipends are limited and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
* [When will Access DU take place?](#) 

  The program will run from **July 17th - 19th.**
