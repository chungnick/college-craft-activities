### Our campus will take your breath away (literally).

At a mile above sea level, our campus provides incredible city and mountain views that will elevate your expectations of a college campus! Explore our wide variety of visit programs and events to find the one that best suits your needs. While we always recommend seeing our campus in person if possible, you can easily explore the beauty of DU from your home. We don't mean to brag, but we do have one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation according to the [Princeton Review](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/university-denver-1023671?ceid=best-colleges).

[Admitted Student Visit Options](https://www.du.edu/admission-aid/undergraduate/visit/admitted-students)

### Visit Us In Person

#### Come enjoy DU's campus scenery and energy!

We truly believe that visiting campus is the best way to learn about a school. Explore our upcoming programs and events on campus, ranging from self-guided tours to more in-depth itineraries, and everything in-between!

[In-Person Visit Options](/admission-aid/undergraduate/in-person)

### Virtual Live Programs

#### Explore DU from the comfort of home!

As much as we would love to host you in Denver, we know it's not always possible to organize a visit. That's why we offer many live virtual options for students and families, too! Check out our upcoming programming and register for the event that best suits your needs and interests.

[Virtual Visit Options](/admission-aid/undergraduate/virtualvisit)

### On-Demand Virtual Resources

#### Learn more about our programs, communities and resources.

There are so many things we want you to know about DU - which is why we decided you should be able to choose what you care about most. Check out our collection of helpful webinars on a wide range of topics or take our virtual 360-degree tour to make your way through campus and see our buildings at your own pace.

[Virtual Tour](https://www.youvisit.com "Virtual Reality, Virtual Tour")

* [### Group Visits](#)

  [Register for a Group Visit](https://admission.du.edu/portal/group-visits)

  We offer special visit sessions for groups of up to 40 people. These are excellent opportunities for high schools, community colleges and educational organizations to teach their students about college access and planning while supported by our admission and counseling staff.
* [### Counselor Visits](#)

  [Register for a Counselor Visit](https://admission.du.edu/portal/visit)

  If you're a high school counselor or higher education consultant, you're welcome to sign up for a visit to DU! Campus visits last for 2.5 hours total, including a 60-minute information session with an admission representative followed by a 90-minute campus tour with a current DU student. You'll learn about everything from application timelines to our fantastic study abroad program.
* [### Graduate Students](#)

  [Register for a Campus Graduate Tour](https://www.du.edu/graduate-education/campus-tours)

  If you're considering joining us as a graduate student or you've already been admitted, we hope you'll take the time to visit our campus. **The Office of Graduate Education is excited to offer campus tours on Fridays.** This tour will take approximately 45 minutes and will provide you with an overview of life as a graduate student at DU.

  Hopefully one of these graduate-focused tours works with your schedule, but should it not, you are welcome to attend one of the daily campus tours hosted by Undergraduate Admission. Because these tours are geared towards undergraduate students, most of the information may not be directly relevant to you. But it's still a great chance to explore campus and get to know the neighborhood. [See the Undergraduate Admission Daily Campus Visit schedule.](https://admission.du.edu/portal/visit)

## Meet DU closer to home.

Our counselors enjoy meeting prospective students from all over the country and the world. Find out what in-person and virtual events we'll be participating in next.
