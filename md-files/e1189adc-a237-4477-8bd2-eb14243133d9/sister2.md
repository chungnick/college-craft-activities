# Summer programs

## Engaging and fun health-oriented learning opportunities

---

Summer programs at ASU’s College of Health Solutions provide engaging and fun health-oriented learning opportunities and supportive therapies for children and teens. With our summer programs, we aim to improve the health of our communities by teaching young people how to be healthy and stay healthy.

Many of our programs help teens socialize and discover rewarding careers in health. Camps for younger children teach them about healthy behaviors and how to bring a love for health into their own lives. Other programs offer assistance with speech, hearing and language needs in a friendly and supportive way.

We know how important good health is — and that it begins with young people who want to be healthy and make a difference. Get started with our summer programs.
