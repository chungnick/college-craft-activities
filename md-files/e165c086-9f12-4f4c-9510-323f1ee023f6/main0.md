# Biotechnology Sequencing (BTS) Camp for High School Students

# Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis

Do you want the power to understand genome sequencing data?

The BTS camp will give you the skills to analyze next-gen raw sequencing data through the use of the Linux operating system and various Linux commands to run programs.

This camp is all computational, teaching a crucial component of sequencing research. Sequencing data analysis is a skillset highly sought in many biomedical labs.

Like all our camps, this is also a research camp where you will generate results while learning necessary science and skills. Sounds intimidating? No worries. We have wonderful, fun group leaders who will guide you along the way. No programming experience is needed, but we will assume you have a high school biology-level understanding of transcription and translation. Though minimal knowledge is required, we do need your attention, curiosity, and most importantly, open mind to fully engage, including participating in oddball games.

The [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE)](https://micde.umich.edu/) has provided access to the University of Michigan’s high performance computing [Great Lakes Slurm cluster](https://arc-ts.umich.edu/greatlakes/) for all campers to run calculations in a Linux environment.

## Example of camper-generated research results

## All campers learn to use the Linux clusters to obtain sequencing mapping results like this

**DATE:** July 13 – July 17, 2026 (Mon – Fri)

**TIME:** 10 am – 5 pm, Eastern Time (7 am – 2 pm, Pacific Time)

**LOCATION:** University of Michigan Campus, Ann Arbor, MI or Virtual (running together with the UM camp)

**INTENDED AUDIENCE:**Academically motivated current (2025-26) high school students interested in computers, math, science, and medicine.

**PREFERRED CANDIDATES:** Students who took the Computational Biology camp

**PREREQUISITE:** High school biology class

**RESEARCH PROJECT:** Using real human data, identify who has specific infections such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causing virus) or RSV. You may also identify new variants if you finish all other tasks.

**TUITION**:

     University of Michigan in-person camp: $875

     Virtual camp: $610

Students will receive a **$80 discount** for each additional camp purchased beyond the first.

Among the camps, only CB camp participation will qualify for the miRcore volunteer program. If you have not taken a CB camp previously (including in 2026 summer), this camp alone will not provide qualification for the miRcore volunteer program.

*After reviewing your essay in the application form, we will inform you regarding acceptance within 7-10 business days. If accepted, you will be sent payment options. **Limited partial scholarships are available for financially-challenged students such as those in free or reduced lunch program. Proof of income is required.***

*A computer with internet connection is required to join the online camp.*

**APPLICATION FEE:** $75

### **Sponsors:**

**Goals**

1. Expose high school students to career opportunities in biomedicine through hands-on experience in computational genomics and prepare them for the emerging era of medical genomics, when all doctors must be well-acquainted with genetic discoveries, technologies, and applications.
2. Identify talents for long-term research projects involving sequencing data.

**Specific Aims**

1. Become familiar with Unix commands and run programs using the command lines.
2. Understand nucleotide hybridization and related thermodynamics.
3. Understand next generation sequencing (NGS) technology.
4. Analyze NGS data and identify who has COVID-19 (and new variants) or other virus.
5. Understand the progress of biotechnology.

**Refund Policy**

– The $100 administrative fee will not be refunded once the camp application is accepted.  
– If a student withdraws, the camp fee paid minus the administrative fee will be refunded if we are notified by May 7, 2026.  
– If a student withdraws between May 8 and three weeks before the camp starting date, we will refund 50 percent of the camp fee paid.  
– Refunds will be given until three weeks before the camp starting date.
