## High School Student Applicants for Research Teams

Student researchers in lab. In alignment with our mission to foster a supportive environment for all members of our university community, this program is open to all eligible students regardless of race, color or national origin.

**Rising 10th - 12th graders from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin** are encouraged to apply for this authentic STEMM research experience at a world-class research university for 6 weeks during the summer. Participating students gain hands-on experience in areas at the forefront of various STEMM fields, such as cancer immunology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, physics, quantum mechanics, bioengineering, electrical engineering, and more!

This program is a **Broadening Participation** initiative that aims to provide support and empowerment for traditionally excluded populations in STEMM including (but not limited to) the areas of socioeconomic status, first generation college students, gender, race, ethnicity, and ability. Idea initiatives provide a safe environment to build a community of peers and mentors who empower one another to be confident and courageous in their exploration of STEMM. **All who meet the grade range and location eligibility are welcome to apply.**

## What Young Scholars Researchers do

Student researchers presenting at a final research symposium.

* Participate in cutting-edge research activities of established researchers in engineering, computer science, and medicine.
* Develop professional and college-ready skills with weekly seminars on various topics such as college admission processes and supports available, communicating scientifically, and how to prepare a research poster.
* Develop greater confidence in yourself as a scientist and engineer.
* Interact with faculty, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and local high school teachers who will support you through this STEMM research adventure.
* Showcase your research at the end of the experience with a research poster and symposium.
* Plan for 30-35 hours per week of research and professional development time. A majority of activities will occur on the University of Illinois campus.
* No cost to participate in this program other than transportation to and from campus. Housing, meals, and a monetary award are provided.

## 2025 Research Groups

If selected, you will be assigned to a research group based on evidence within your application such as your personal statement and the coursework you have recently completed. To help narrow that focus, we ask you to prioritize your research your program choices based on what seems most interesting to you when applying.

### The 2025 Young Scholars Program Research Groups are:

* **SpHERES Young Scholars** participate in research from departments across campus that include but are not limited to: Sociology, Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Neuroscience, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Bioengineering, Human Development and Family studies, Kinesiology,  and Micro & Nanotechnology Laboratory.  The [Sparking High Schoolers' Excitement for Research in Engineering and Science program](https://medicine.illinois.edu/diversity/pathway-programs-and-partnerships/spheres-high-school-research-program) focuses cultivating interests in medicine, engineering, innovation and/or entrepreneurship. **[APPLY HERE](https://enroll.illinois.edu/register/?id=39b26beb-66fb-47a7-8c73-b8268f1b31e5)**
* **Grainger Engineering Young Scholars (GEnYuS)** work in department-specific research groups that might include computer science, mechanical engineering, nuclear or quantum physics, aerospace engineering, materials science, electrical engineering, civil engineering, bioengineering, and more. **[APPLY HERE](https://enroll.illinois.edu/register/?id=39b26beb-66fb-47a7-8c73-b8268f1b31e5)**
* **Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP)** Lithium-ion batteries are not great for the environment, and the materials needed to make them are in limited supply. Sodium-ion batteries (SiBs) are a promising alternative, and the electrolyte is a crucial component.Interns will help to design and characterize promising and environmental friendly electrolytes. Applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident. Restricted to rising 11th/12th grade students in the Champaign-Urbana area. For more details about the AEOP program, visit the [AEOP website](https://www.usaeop.com/type/internships-fellowships/). [**APPLY HERE**](https://apps.ideal-logic.com/aeop)

Those accepted into the program will be matched with another student, and in some cases, with a teacher from their school. Everyone must apply separately, and it is not required to have a teacher from your school to apply.
