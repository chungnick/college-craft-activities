[SAME Camps FAQs](https://www.same.org/camps/camps-faqs/)

> *Our son really enjoyed the USAFA campus, SAME STEM Camp Counselors, and the structured program which afforded him several “hands on experience” with construction, problem solving, and leadership. The SAME STEM Camp leadership, organization, and structure of this camp not only exceeded the expectations of our son and family but has left a long-lasting impression with Xavier to continue his passion to return to the USAFA next summer by getting selected to attend their “Summer Seminar” and eventually attend the USAFA as a Cadet in 2026.*

> Attending the SAME/Marine Corps Engineering & Construction Camp has been one of the most life-changing and interesting experiences I have gone through. Every day, there were so many new and exciting feats to accomplish and concepts to learn. Throughout the duration of the camp, I was part of the Bravo Squad. It was led by three amazing mentors and throughout the week, team-building exercises brought us together as a group and strengthened our teamwork. We may not have been the top team, but we were constant contenders and had great morale and inspiration no matter what.

Each summer, SAME Camps provide aspiring engineering students from across the country an opportunity for hands-on learning in collaboration with military engineers and SAME members. The program began with the SAME camp in 2000, and remains a very unique opportunity for aspiring STEM students 25 years later.

The week-long camps, held in conjunction with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps are designed for high school students who excel in math, science and technology courses and are interested in pursuing engineering, architecture, or a related field in college. The camps are led by a professional staff of engineers from both private industry and the uniformed services. Many former campers have gone on to STEM careers in both the military and civilian capacity and come back to the camp as mentors.

If you are interested, your first step is to determine if you are eligible and then go through the application process for the camp you select.

**Am I Eligible?**

To qualify for consideration, students must meet the following criteria:

* Be a U.S. citizen.
* Be at least 15 years old and have completed their freshman year of high school at the time he/she departs for camp.
* For the US Army Camp, you must have completed your sophomore year in high school.
* Be enrolled in school at the time of the camp.
* Be on a high school track that will provide a basis for attending an accredited engineering college or university (i.e., taking appropriate math and science courses).
* Have an intent to pursue a degree in architecture, engineering or a related field.
* Have demonstrated leadership characteristics through participation in extra-curricular activities, sports, and/or community activities.
* Be physically fit and healthy.
