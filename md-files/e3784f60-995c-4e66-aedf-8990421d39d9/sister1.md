# SAME Camps – FAQs

## SAME Camps – FAQs

---

**What are the application dates?**  
The application will open early December and close at 11:59pm on Wednesday, March 11, 2026.

**How old does a camper need to be to apply?**  
Each camper must be 15 years old on the day they arrive at their respective camp. There will be no exceptions to this age requirement.

**I’m not a U.S. citizen. Can I still apply?**  
Since U.S. citizenship is required to visit the government installations that the camps utilize, all campers must be U.S. citizens.

**I previously attended an SAME national camp. Can I apply again?**  
We want as many people as possible to experience our camps, so we limit everyone to attending one camp. Any previous camper applications will be rejected.

---

**Can I apply to more than one camp?**  
The application will allow each applicant to rank their top two choices for camps. Each applicant will be considered first for slots based on this ranking. Applicants are not guaranteed to be accepted to their top choice.

**Does applying to the program guarantee a spot in a camp?**  
With a growing number of applicants and only so many camp slots each year, we are unfortunately not able to accept everyone. If eligible, we encourage those not selected to reapply for future summer sessions.

**I am a rising sophomore. Should I still apply?**  
Yes! Although preference is given to rising juniors and seniors, sophomores are still considered for camp slots each year.

*Note: The Army camp will not accept any rising sophomores.*

---

**When will applicants be notified of their application status?**  
Applicants will be notified no later than Wednesday, April 1, 2026, of the status of their application.

**I’m on the waitlist. When will we hear if I got into camp or not?**  
While the waitlist fluctuates in capacity and timing of openings each year, we may contact applicants on the waitlist as close as a week before the start of a camp week. We ask anyone who is no longer interested in remaining on the waitlist to let us know about removal from the list.

**What is the cancellation policy?**  
If you need to cancel your camper’s registration, please refer to our cancellation policy: Cancellations made more than 2 weeks before the camp start date are eligible for a 50% refund. Cancellations made within 2 weeks of the camp start date are not refundable.

---

**Are there financial aid/scholarship opportunities for campers?**

Yes! All selected campers are eligible for sponsorship upon applying and will be notified if they are selected as a sponsored camper with their acceptance documents. If you have direct questions regarding financial aid for camps, please contact [Amy McGeever](mailto:amcgeever@same.org), Project Manager of STEM Camps.

What does an average day of camp look like?

Although each day is different and each camp does different activities, this is a great example of a day a camper may expect before attending one of our camps.

**Morning**: The day will start with an optional PT session at some camps. Everyone will then get to breakfast and then head out to tour their location’s airfield, stadium, or other cool facility or start a design and construction activity.

**Afternoon**: Boxed lunches are served, and campers will enjoy their meal while listening to a panel of government engineers sharing their journeys into entering their profession. After lunch, campers will continue construction of their squad’s cardboard canoe. Those canoes will then be raced to win this day’s challenge for their squad in the onsite pool.

**Evening**: Campers will shower and change after their time in the pool to head back to the home base for a BBQ and get ready for the night’s talent show. The mentors may show off some of their hidden talents as well!

**How many campers are there?**

Camp size differs between each camp, but the smallest camp has 40 campers, and the largest camp has 80 campers.

**Do camp staff undergo background checks?**

Yes, the safety of our campers is our top priority. All camp staff undergo comprehensive background checks, including criminal history screenings and reference checks. Additionally, staff members are trained in child safety protocols before camp begins.

**What if my camper cannot attend the full camp time?**

We ask all applicants to only apply if they know they can stay for the entirety of the camp week. If for whatever reason you are not able to attend the full week, we will have to give your slot to someone on our waitlist.

**How does drop-off, pick-up work?**

Camp drop-off and pick-up are held at designated locations at the beginning and end of each camp session. Specific times and instructions will be sent to you closer to the start of camp. For security reasons, we require all campers to be signed in and out by an authorized adult or have clear instructions on travel arrangements if the camper is coming to camp alone. We ask that parents/guardians are prompt to ensure a smooth transition for all campers. Transportation will be provided by the camp to anyone flying into the airport closest to each camp.

**What should my camper bring to camp?**

Items to bring to camp vary between each camp location and a detailed checklist will be sent out to accepted campers with their acceptance documents.

If you have any additional questions, please contact [Amy McGeever](mailto:amcgeever@same.org), Project Manager of STEM Camps.
