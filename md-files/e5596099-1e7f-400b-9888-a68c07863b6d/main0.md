# Neuroscience Summer Student Program

**Applications for the 2026 Program are now closed**

The UW Medicine Department of Neuroscience Summer Scholars Program provides “Bench to Bedside” exposure in the field of neurosciences.

Established in 2008 by Richard G. Ellenbogen, MD, Professor and Chair of the UW Department of Neurological Surgery, the program provides students opportunities to explore basic and clinical neurosciences through laboratory research and clinical observation.

Our hope is that students will be inspired by their experience to pursue an academic career in research and/or medicine.

Sections

**Mission Statement**

Our mission is to broaden students' knowledge base in the field of biomedical research, including translational, clinical, and basic research, and to inspire students to pursue a career in research, medicine, or allied fields, especially in Neuroscience.

Participation in this NIH-funded summer program Includes:

* Eight-week lab placement in one of our neuroscience labs
* Neurological Surgery OR observations
* Neuroscience clinical observations
* Weekly Neurological Surgery Grand Round Lectures
* Weekly Neuroscience Faculty Lectures
* Weekly Neurological Surgery Resident Education Hour discussions
* Student presentation of individual program focus
* $3200 Summer student stipend paid over 4 UW pay periods
* Program-sponsored housing for a limited number of out-of-town students

Note: high school or recent high school graduates must be 18 years of age or older to participate

**Program at a Glance**

* Complete a research project and gain laboratory experience
* Shadow in one of our Neurology or Neurological Surgery Clinics
* Observe neurosurgical procedures in one of our Operating Rooms
* Participate in our Grand Rounds and Friday Faculty talks lectures series

Founded in 2008, 192 high school and college undergraduate students aged 18 and older from 90 different schools have completed our program. We have had over 1500 applicants from 43 states and territories. Over 25 students from earlier classes have gone on to neuroscience, medical school, or Ph.D. neuroscience programs.

The UW Neuroscience Summer Student Program is proud to be supported by grants from the National Institute of Health (NIH).
