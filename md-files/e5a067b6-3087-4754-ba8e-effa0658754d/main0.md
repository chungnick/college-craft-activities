## **PROGRAM DATES: JULY 6–31, 202**6

Spend your summer immersed in the world of architecture, urban design, and sustainable city planning on the UC Berkeley campus. embARC is an engaging college-level course that offers you the chance to study at the top-ranked public university for architecture and the built environment alongside students from all over the world.

Challenging design assignments, one-on-one reviews with instructors, field trips around the Bay Area, and a design/build project for a community nonprofit introduce you to the skills, ideas, and culture of an environmental design education. You’ll leave the program with a strong portfolio for your college applications in any area of environmental design and credit on an official UC Berkeley transcript.

**Sign up for our information session:**

**Tuesday,** **February 10, 2026** at 5:00 pm (Pacific Time) – **[RSVP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAV2VX_k2nsjI1pHQouKvDPZVco8aPOHyu0qZlbHtyWX04Uw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=103965417479167752624)**

**Applications for 2026 are open.** We encourage you to apply early since the program fills up quickly. To receive updates and reminders, sign up for our**[mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/berkeley/ced-summer-signup).**

## Why embARC?

### In this fun and challenging four-week program you will:

* Explore architecture, urban design, and city planning as possible college majors and careers
* Develop technical and time-management skills through college-level coursework
* Work with fellow students with similar interests
* Build a design portfolio to use when applying to college
* Be exposed to public policy issues that empower you to make a real impact on your community
* Earn college credit on an official UC Berkeley transcript and receive a certificate of completion
* Take part in building a project for a local nonprofit organization

## About embARC

As an embARC student, you’ll have the chance to work on realistic design projects and be a part of developing solutions to real-world urban planning issues. embARC’s multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive framework for “placemaking.”

**Architecture + Urban Design Studio**

Learn how to conceptualize and communicate design ideas in 2D and 3D through instruction in freehand sketching, drafting, model-building, and digital representation.

**Environmental Design Conversation Series**

Presentations and talks by local professionals and Berkeley professors provide a theoretical framework for the practice and methods of environmental design. Guided discussion groups engage you in the key discourses of the discipline.

**Materials Exploration Workshop**

Explore how a full building physically comes together – from foundation to finishes – through multiple precedent studies and drafting exercises. Then design your own tiny house!

**Sustainable City Planning Workshop**

Engage as a stakeholder and participant in a community change process through site observations, research, and the development of an authentic urban planning question.

**Digital Design Workshop**

Prepare for technology-driven college-level design courses by building skills in digital representation with the latest software and digital tools.

**Community Build**

True to UC Berkeley’s public mission, embARC fosters civic responsibility by partnering with a local organization to design a community improvement project. You’ll use the skills and tools learned in studios, workshops, and lectures to make a real impact on the community. **[View Community Build projects](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/embarc-summer-design-academy/community-build).**

“The highlight of the program for me was the design and build project we did for the campus food bank, building a bike attachment for a mobile market. This inspired me to think about how design work can be fun as well as make an impact in the community. I became interested in embARC when trying to decide if I wanted to apply to architecture school for college. It was a great way for me to experience what a design education would be like and if it was right for me. Currently, I’m studying architecture at Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis.

## Typical Daily Schedule

Typical daily schedule includes:

* Architecture + Urban Design Studio: 9 a.m.–12 p.m., Guest lectures on Tuesdays
* Workshops in Materials Exploration, Digital Design, and Sustainable City Planning: 1–4 p.m.
* Extended studio time / socials: 4–6 p.m.

embARC is a fast-paced program, and important information is covered in every class. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present every day for the full four weeks of the program. Students who anticipate missing too much class time will not be allowed to participate in the program. If it is unavoidable that a student must miss a day or two of the program, the student will be expected to clear the absence with their instructor in advance. It is also the student’s responsibility to check with their instructor about making up missed work or assignments. Any anticipated absence or tardiness must additionally be reported to the embARC Administrative Team by emailing embarc@berkeley.edu.

“Thank you all for creating such a dynamic summer program. The embARC staff was nothing short of fantastic: each day they arrived fully vested with awesome energy and each week they continued to mentor and find ways to listen to, help, and motivate our son. He really enjoyed learning what led the local architect guest speaker to become a designer. He also enjoyed meeting and working with students from around the Bay Area, country, and globe. He gained new perspectives, experiences, and insights. He felt connected.”

## Eligibility

## Commute or Choose Campus Housing

### COMMUTER

Students who live locally, within 45 minutes of the UC Berkeley campus, may opt to commute to embARC as a day program. Domestic students who live outside the local Bay Area, who do not require a visa/I-20 or campus housing, and plan to stay with a parent or extended family in the area, may apply to the embARC program as a commuter student. Students who will be 18 years old by July 5, 2026, may attend only as commuter students.

Students are allowed to stay with an adult family member residing in the San Francisco Bay Area while attending the program. Students must stay with responsible adult relatives who are able to provide care, shelter, meals, and supervision for the duration of the program. Please note: embARC participants are not permitted to stay in co-ops, homestays, or other housing arrangements that are with non-family members. Students found in violation of this policy will be immediately dismissed from the program.

### **CAMPUS HOUSING**

Domestic and visiting international high school students who live outside the Bay Area and/or require a visa/I-20 or accommodation support must request on-campus housing. Residential students stay in Stern Hall, which offers traditional residence hall rooms. Stern Hall is within walking distance of Bauer Wurster Hall, where the embARC classes take place.

Please note: *The number of residential students we can accommodate in the embARC program is limited. If you wish to live on campus, you must be 16-17 years old by July 5, 2026, and request housing by the posted deadline indicated on our website’s [Deadlines & Fees](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/summer-programs/costs-deadlines) page. **The cost of housing is a separate fee and not included in the embARC tuition.** Housing costs include three meals per day.* Students who will be 18 years old by July 5, 2026, cannot stay in embARC campus housing.
