### Acting

#### Acting & Improv

Students will participate in rigorous acting, voice and speech, movement, and scene study classes to learn the art of acting for the stage. Students will also explore improvisation and learn techniques through coaching and warm-up exercises that will build confidence and improve theatrical performance skills.

### Comic Illustration

#### My World of Comics

My World of Comics is a weeklong comic making class where you will explore a few basic comic skills. Each day you will focus on one to two fundamental elements of the craft: writing, drawing, inking, coloring, lettering, prepress, and printing. This will be an exciting class for all skill levels. We will also have guest speakers. Let’s have fun making comics together.

### Dance Intensive

#### African, Ballet, Hip-Hop & Modern Dance

In this track, teens will join the faculty and students of one of the strongest and oldest dance programs in the country. Students will be immersed in intense technical training in various styles and forms including modern dance, ballet, African dance, and hip-hop.

### Fashion

#### Fashion Design

Ever wondered what the steps are between a fashion designer having an idea for a creation and it finding its way to a shopping center near you? In Fashion Design, you will take on the role of fashion designer, learning the basics of design, construction, and sewing to make your very own one-of-a-kind avant garde ensemble using existing clothing as raw material. Make it work, and create a runway-worthy fit!

### Graphic Design

This track teaches graphic design fundamentals including gestalt principles of visual perception, color theory, branding, bookmaking, typography, and digital file management. Students will use the Adobe suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign) to design, print, and digitally publish one book cover, one album cover, and two promotional posters. In so doing, we will hone technical skills while having fun making high-quality visual graphics!

### Photography

Photography is a primary form of communication. In this course students will explore fundamental facets including technical dimensions like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO; aesthetic dimensions like composition, color theory, and lighting; and conceptual dimensions like narrative strategies, emotional affect, and critical analysis. Each day we will work with a different photographic process through individual projects, discussions, viewings, and field trips. Students will be encouraged to apply the skills worked on in the course to their personal projects beyond the course.

### Printmaking

Students in this intensive will make relief block prints. We will cut linoleum and tile pieces together to make complex multicolor compositions. Students will learn how professional poster artists make their relief prints, using a press and printing with oil-based ink. Carving tools and linoleum will be provided.

### Studio Art: Painting & Drawing

Students will create a series of works on paper based on individualized themes, inspired by contemporary artists and art making. Repetition of subject matter and media will lead to a final series of explorations that consider compositional emphasis and layering of materials. Students will be exposed to and encouraged to explore a variety of media—watercolor, ink, acrylic, charcoal, and graphite—to experiment with scale, interpretation, grouping, and presentation.

### Theatre Tech & Design

#### Design, Technology & Management for the Theatre

Experience Illinois Theatre backstage and beyond! Students will explore what it means to work behind the scenes in theatre. Learn the skills and techniques you need to successfully put up a show. Gain hands-on experience in a variety of theatrical jobs including scenic/props design and technology, costume design, lighting design and technology, sound design, and stage management.

*Please note: Course descriptions are subject to change. Courses may have an additional course fee or required supplies.*
