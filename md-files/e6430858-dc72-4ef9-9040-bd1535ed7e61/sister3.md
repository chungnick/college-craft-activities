# Financing Your Education

Need-based and merit-based scholarships are available from the College of Fine and Applied Arts, through the university, from private organizations, and through public groups and competitions.

## Scholarships and Other Support

### Needs-Based Scholarships

Financial guidelines are used to award many scholarships at the university. To be considered, a student must complete a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa "FAFSA") (free application for federal student aid). The [Office of Student Financial Aid](https://osfa.illinois.edu/ "Office of Student Financial Aid") has links to specific need-based programs, requirements, and applications.

### Merit-Based Scholarships

All students are screened for their eligibility for academic scholarships by the Office of Admissions when they apply to the university. No additional application is needed to be considered for these awards. In addition, merit scholarships are given by FAA to students in specific degree programs. Suitable candidates are selected for talent-based awards during their audition, interview, and/or portfolio review. For programs that require an application and essay only, a student’s academic record and demonstrated passion for their major will be assessed. No additional application is required for FAA merit and talent scholarships. Eligible students will be contacted directly about these awards. For additional information about scholarships offered in the College of Fine and Applied Arts, contact the FAA Office of Undergraduate Affairs at 217-333-6061 or [faa-uaa@illinois.edu](mailto:faa-uaa@illinois.edu "faa-uaa@illinois.edu").

### Private and independent Assistance

For information about national and independently administered awards, consult with the [Office of Student Financial Aid](https://osfa.illinois.edu/ "Office of Student Financial Aid"). Links to many private scholarships and tips on where to find other opportunities are available.
