### **What is Summer Academy?**

Rising high school Juniors and Seniors get a taste of the college experience, earning three college credits through a variety of studio, seminar, field work and extracurricular activities. Students understand architecture as a possible area of college study, and as a career.

Assignments expose students to basic architectural principles, digital drawing and modeling techniques, and contemporary practice. Mentoring by current undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants allow Summer Academy students to learn about campus academic life directly from students.

Team design challenges give Summer Academy and RWU Cummings School of Architecture students an opportunity chance to collaborate on a larger scale project. A series of keynote lectures, extracurricular events, and virtual field trips to exceptional built environments and buildings round out the curriculum.

Students are advised on the college admissions process and portfolio development in preparation for college applications. Participants gain a broader view of the field while developing skills and portfolio materials to add to their applications to professional school. Workshops, lectures, and demonstrations complement daily design studios.

### Application

Application deadline: June 15, 2026

Required Application materials: High School Transcript and one Letter of Reference.
