## Apply to the College Prep Scholars Program

## Why apply?

*This page will be updated soon for the 2026 College Prep Scholars Program.*

The College Prep Scholars Program equips high-achieving high school juniors from low-income backgrounds with the knowledge, confidence, and resources to apply to top colleges.

We are looking for high school juniors who have shown outstanding academic ability despite financial challenges. We take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, and we do not have absolute criteria or cut-offs for GPA, standardized test scores, income, or other factors.

### Did you know?

College Prep Scholars are over seven times more likely than other applicants to receive full four-year scholarships through the National College Match.

* Eligibility
* Academic achievement
* Financial qualifications
* Personal qualities

Any high school junior currently attending high school in the U.S. is eligible to apply to the College Prep Scholars Program. Additionally, U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents living abroad are eligible. International students living outside the U.S. are not eligible.

Applicants must be high school juniors who are planning to apply to college during the fall of their senior year.

### Typically, College Prep Scholars…

* Earn primarily A’s in the most challenging courses available and display intellectual curiosity and strong writing ability.
* Rank in the top 5-10% of their class.
* Challenge themselves by taking Honors, AP, and/or IB courses, if available.
* If submitting standardized test scores, likely score within middle 50% SAT score: 1310 - 1490 and/or middle 50% ACT score: 26-31.

Test scores are not required to apply. All applications are reviewed holistically, so students who have not taken standardized tests can still be selected as College Prep Scholars.

### Typically, College Prep Scholars…

* Come from households earning less than $65,000 annually (for a household of four) and have minimal assets.
* Qualify for free or reduced-price school meals.
* Face financial hardship.

### Typically, College Prep Scholars…

* Demonstrate resilience, integrity, and motivation to succeed.
* Make meaningful contributions to activities at home, school, or in the community.
* Are among the first generation in their family to attend a four-year college.

## Application components

* Information on your academics, activities, household, and financial background
* Writing section
* A teacher reference from a core academic subject
* Current high school transcript (unofficial transcripts are accepted)
* Any standardized test score reports to-date (if taken). We accept PSAT, PreACT, SAT, ACT, or AP test scores (unofficial test score reports are accepted)
* School Profile (strongly recommended if available)

### Important note:

Access to the previous year’s tax returns, W-2(s), or other financial documents is highly recommended to complete the application accurately.
