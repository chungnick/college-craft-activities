[Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Career and Technical Education (CTE) Internships](https://www.cps.edu/academics/career-and-technical-education/)

In partnership with Chicago Public Schools, NM has hosted summer interns in our Pharmacy and Information Systems departments. Students work as part of the One Summer Chicago program for 5 weeks alongside our staff learning lifelong skills while gaining valuable hands-on experience.

[Cristo Rey High School Corporate Work Study Program](https://www.cristorey.net/)

NM is a proud corporate partner of the Corporate Work Study Program (CWSP), a shared program of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School and Christ the King Jesuit College Prep. Through CWSP, students work for and earn a majority of the cost of their education — making a quality, college preparatory education possible for students who could not otherwise afford it. The resulting work experience, career exploration, mentorship, and networking students receive is invaluable in positioning them to succeed in college and beyond and puts them at a competitive edge against their peers.

The vision of the Northwestern Medicine Scholars Program is to offer enriching experiences that enable outstanding high school students at our partner schools to explore and be better prepared for potential careers in medicine as future physicians and biomedical scientists.

[Urban Alliance Partnership](https://www.urbanalliance.org/)

Urban Alliance is building a diverse next-generation workforce by providing job skills training, mentoring, and paid internships to high school youth. NM partners with Urban Alliance to place interns in various roles across the system depending on their interest.

## Student Spotlight

[Patrick S.](/about-us/workforce-development/high-school-programs/nm-discovery-program)

Discovery Program

*"My favorite meeting was focused on all of the outreach NM does to make itself accessible to the community. After completing the two-year Discovery Program, I was able to work as an intern in NM Patient Relations and Interpretation Services where I applied many of the leadership skills I learned during the Discovery Program."*

[Samantha T.](/about-us/workforce-development/high-school-programs/nm-discovery-program)

Discovery Program

*"The Discovery Program allowed me to explore branches of the medical field that I was interested in and exposed me to different areas I had not yet known about through many hands-on activities and opportunities."*

[Vivian C.](/about-us/workforce-development/high-school-programs/nm-scholars-program)

Scholars Program

*"Being an NM Scholar has given me the opportunity to learn about topics I love with others who share similar passions. I've experienced surgical simulations, practiced surgical techniques, learned basic anatomy, and talked about inequalities within the medical field with doctors."*
