## Frequently Asked Questions

Peruse these common queries about entering the challenge.

How do students enter?

To enter, students need to submit a 1-2 minute video in which they describe a new invention or solution that could solve or impact an everyday problem that directly affects them, their families, their communities, and/or the global population. Get ideas from this year’s [entry topics](/annual-challenge/entry-topics).

How are videos judged?

Videos do NOT need to be "produced" or have high production value. Judges are not evaluating production skills. Videos may be recorded on cell phones or simple digital cameras, for example. In addition, local libraries and schools may be able to loan cameras to students.

What is the summer mentorship program?

The top 10 Finalists will receive a summer assignment to develop a prototype to be completed under the mentorship of a 3M scientist.

Can students enter as pairs or teams?

Students may not submit as pairs or in groups—only individual submissions will be accepted.

What happens at the Final Event?

Ten student finalists will each give a presentation based on their work in the summer mentorship program, and participate in a series of scored challenges to demonstrate their scientific knowledge. The event is anticipated to take place in October 2026, but this date is subject to change.
