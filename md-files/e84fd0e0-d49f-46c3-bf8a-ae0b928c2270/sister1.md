[## Meet the Finalists of the 2025 3M Young Scientist Challenge!](/annual-challenge/finalists-mentors-judges/finalists?years=2025)

## Entry Questions

Get all the answers you need to key questions about the 3M Young Scientist Challenge.

How do students enter?

To enter, students need to submit a 1–2-minute video in which they describe a new innovation or solution that could solve or impact an everyday problem that directly affects them, their families, their communities, and/or the global population. Get ideas from this year’s [entry topics.](/annual-challenge/entry-topics)

Is the competition open to anyone?

The competition is open to all legal U.S. residents who are students enrolled in 5th through 8th grade at a public, private, parochial, or home school located in one of the fifty United States or the District of Columbia.

Why do parents have to grant permission for students to enter?

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Parental/Guardian consent is needed for any person under the age of 13 years to give personal information to a third party over the internet. In the case of our competition, each student's parent/guardian needs to grant consent for us to receive their entry.

Can students enter as pairs or teams?

Students may not submit as pairs or in groups—only individual submissions will be accepted.

Can music be used in my video?

Entry videos may not contain music unless created by the student or by someone who has given the entrant permission to use his/her music.

Where can students get a video camera?

Many cell phones and digital cameras can be used to film a short video. Students who don't have access to either can check with their teacher, school media center, or local public library.

How can students retrieve a lost username/password?

When a student's parent/guardian completed the required consent form and registration form, the student's username and a link to change their password were emailed to the student and his/her parent/guardian.

Are there rules and guidelines about how to make a video?

Yes, you can find video submission instructions and entry topics [here](/annual-challenge/about-the-challenge). It is also very important that each student reads and complies with the Official Rules and Regulations and Safety Guidelines. The official rules for the 2026 3M Young Scientist Challenge are posted here.[here](https://dlc.com/3MYSC-rules).

Are there examples of successful videos that can be viewed?

Helpful [challenge tips](/pdfs/2_annual-challenge/3M-YSC-ChallengeResource-ChallengeVideoTips.pdf) and [previous winners' videos](/annual-challenge/finalists-mentors-judges/finalists?years=2022#innovators) are available to inspire your entry. Note: Entry criteria changes each year, so please read the guidelines carefully.

How do students submit a video?

To apply, students must create a profile in the 3M Young Scientist Challenge Application Portal with the help of a parent or guardian. Once a student's parent/guardian has completed the consent form and registration page the student will be able to submit a video file (MP4 format). Students should submit a video by April 30, 2026 at 11:59pm ET. Before uploading your video, be sure it meets the following criteria:

1. Your video only contains your original ideas and work.
2. Your video does not have copyrighted or trademarked content.
3. Please make sure the title of your video is "3MYSC Submission—[Your Title]".
4. Your video is between 1-2 minutes in length.

Any video that does not meet this criteria will be disqualified from the challenge. Questions? Email us at [YSC@DiscoveryEd.com](mailto:ysc@discoveryed.com)

Can submitted videos be updated?

Yes, videos can be updated prior to the entry deadline of April 30, 2026 at 11:59pm ET. If a student is interested in making updates, please reach out to ysc@discoveryed.com for instructions.

## Judging Questions

How are videos judged?

Videos do NOT need to be "produced" or have high production value. Judges are not evaluating production skills. Videos may be recorded on cell phones or simple digital cameras, for example. In addition, local libraries and schools may be able to loan cameras to students.

Enries that follow all of the rules and regulations will be ranked based on the average of scores awarded by a panel of judges using the following rubric:

* Creativity (ingenuity and innovative thinking) (30%)
* Scientific knowledge (30%)
* Persuasiveness and effective communication (20%)
* Overall presentation (20%)

Who are the judges?

The video competition is judged by a field of experts in science and communication including current and former teachers, scientists, and representatives from school districts across the country.

When and how will students find out if they have won?

Students will be contacted via phone and/or email in early June if they are selected as a Finalist. State Merit Winners will be notified in mid-June.

## Summer Mentorship Questions

What is the summer mentorship program?

Finalists will receive a summer assignment to develop an innovation to be completed under the mentorship of a 3M scientist.

## Final Event Questions

What happens at the Final Event?

Ten student finalists will each give a presentation based on their work in the summer mentorship program, and participate in a series of scored challenges to demonstrate their scientific knowledge. The event is anticipated to take place in October each year, but is subject to change.

## Prizing Questions

What are the student prizes?

At the end of the competition, America's Top Young Scientist will be awarded $25,000, and other student winners will receive exciting prizes.
