# WHAT TO EXPECT

1. [Home](/)
2. [COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT](/community-engagement)
3. [TERRAPIN MUSIC CAMP](/community-engagement/summer-programs/terrapin-music-camp)

Terrapin Music Camp takes place in The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center at the University of Maryland. Rehearsals occur in the acclaimed School of Music facilities, with the final performance in the Dekelboum Concert Hall.

### General Information

## Registration, Cost & Payment

Registration for our Summer 2026 will open February 1. Registrations are processed in the order in which they are received, and some popular instrument areas are in high demand and close quickly. Register early to ensure that a space in the camp is reserved for you!

The camp takes place from 3-6pm on Sunday and 8:30am-4:30pm Monday through Friday with a concert on Friday starting at 2pm. The cost of the day camp is $455 (Feb. 1-May 31) and $485 (Jun. 1-15) and can be paid in full online when registering.

Students who demonstrate a financial need can apply to receive a discounted rate. Please contact us for details on how to apply.

Refunds are available, minus a $100 administrative fee, until June 15. Please contact us [musiccamp@umd.edu](mailto:musiccamp@umd.edu) to request a refund.

## Health Care

We take students' health and well-being seriously. In the event of an injury or illness, the student will be taken to our camp office. All of our staff are trained in CPR and a number have received training in the administration of medication. The University of Maryland Health Center is available for students in need as well.

Each camper will complete a medical history and permission form as part of the registration process to be kept on file for the duration of the camp.

## Safety at TMC

Campers will be supervised by camp personnel at all times. We’ll have over 50 staff members on campus during each week of the camp. Our staff consists primarily of university faculty, staff and students along with K-12 teachers, including many former Terps!   
  
Expectations, rules and regulations for camp behavior are communicated during the Sunday orientation. Each student receives a name tag with their daily schedule, room locations and other important information and must wear the tag throughout the week.

All of our staff must undergo multiple background checks, including those at the federal and state level.

## Schedule

On Sunday, campers should arrive between 2:30 & 2:55 p.m. for check-in and camp will officially start at 3 p.m. in the Dekelboum Concert Hall, which is one of seven performance venues in the [The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.](https://theclarice.umd.edu/) On Sunday, students will rehearse with their ensembles, visit elective classes, and have time to discover the classrooms they will be using throughout the week. We'll finish the day with an informational (and fun) wrap-up session from 5:30-6:00. Parents can remain at camp or plan to pick up campers around 6:10.

Monday through Friday the camp is held from 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.. Students should be dropped off no earlier than 8:15 and picked up no later than 4:45 each day. Events begin promptly at 8:30 a.m. so please arrive on time. The Friday concert begins at 2:00 p.m. in the Dekelboum Concert Hall with students departing immediately after the concert. Students should wear the camp T-shirt, which will be distributed on Thursday, and their choice of bottom wear (e.g, pants, shorts) and shoes.

The daily camp schedule resembles what a typical high school or middle school. Students will move through ensemble rehearsals, sectionals, elective classes, lunch, concerts, etc. Below is a sample schedule, though it could change:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Time** | **Band** | **Choir** | **Orchestra** |
| 8:30-9:35 | Rehearsal | Rehearsal | Rehearsal |
| 9:40-10:35 | Elective Class 1 | Elective Class 1 | Sectionals |
| 10:40-11:35 | Elective Class 2 | Elective Class 2 | Rehearsal |
| 11:40 - 12:40 | Lunch/Concert | | |
| 12:45-1:40 | Rehearsal | Sectionals | Elective Class 1 |
| 1:45-2:40 | Elective Class 3 | Rehearsal | Elective Class 2 |
| 2:45-3:40 | Sectionals | Elective Class 3 | Elective Class 3 |
| 3:45-4:30 | Rehearsal | Rehearsal | Rehearsal |

## Ensembles

Ensembles are organized by grade level, but instrumentalists with less than two years of experience, regardless of grade, may be placed in a beginning ensemble. Choir students have typically been in a single group, though we may place them in multiple age-based ensembles if the need arises. The ensemble conductors may request to hear students perform at the start of camp to assign them to the parts where they can be most successful.

## What to Bring

Each instrumental student should bring their own instrument to camp. This is true for those who typically use a school instrument as well. If you do not own an instrument we suggest reaching out to your school to borrow one for the week or plan to rent one from a local music store for the week. Students should also bring their lunch.

## Theme Days

The Terrapin Music Camp has a notorious tradition of including theme days, which will be announced ahead of time. Samples of past themes have included "Alumni Day," "Rep Your School," "Wow!," "Colors," "Stars & Stripes," and of course, "Terp Pride Day." Participation is optional but we hope you will join in the fun!

## Parking/Drop-Off/Pick-Up

Directions to the Clarice can be found [here](https://theclarice.umd.edu/visit-us/getting-here).

Campers will be greeted by our staff in front of The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center during drop-off. If you prefer to park and walk them to the building you can park for free in the Stadium Drive Garage (SDG) for up to 15 minutes. Just be sure to register at the kiosk or on the ParkMobile app. Plan to pick up students in the circle drive.

If you are carpooling and need to provide the names of individuals authorized to pick up your child, please contact TMC.

On Sunday, parking is available for free in Lot 1 or Lot Z, located just south of The Clarice. The SDG is a bit closer but costs $5 per hour. For the concert on Friday at 2 p.m., parking is available only in the Stadium Drive Garage (or other campus parking garage).
