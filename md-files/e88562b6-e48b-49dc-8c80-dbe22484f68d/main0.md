# Finance Camp

## Money Moves

Get ready to take control of your future! This hands-on, interactive camp is designed to help you understand the money skills every teen needs to know as they grow up. You’ll learn how to make smart choices with your cash—whether it’s planning for your dream job, creating a personal budget, or understanding how banks, credit, and loans really work. We’ll also cover real-life topics like buying your first car, paying for college, and what auto insurance is all about.

## Become Money Masters: Path to Financial Success!

Learn how to turn dollars and cents into confidence and independence. In this course, teens ages 15–17 will learn how to take charge of their finances through games, challenges, and real-life scenarios. From creating a budget for their dream trip to understanding how credit cards and paychecks work, students will discover the tools to make smart money choices now and in the future. With interactive activities like “Shark Tank”–style pitches, savings competitions, and investment simulations, participants will see how financial skills can open doors to independence and success. By the end of camp, students will walk away with practical money skills—and the confidence to use them.
