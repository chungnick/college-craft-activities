## Summer Camps 2026

### Welcome to Penn State Abington Summer Camps!

We’re excited to welcome potential parents and campers to our summer programs. At Penn State Abington, we are committed to providing a safe, engaging, and enriching experience for every camper. Our camps offer hands-on learning, creativity, and fun in a supportive environment led by experienced instructors.

We’re also pleased to share that **lunch is included in the price of all camps**, making your child’s day even more convenient and enjoyable.

All camp details—including schedules, required forms, health information, and important updates—are always kept **current in our registration system, CampDoc**. We encourage families to check CampDoc regularly to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.
