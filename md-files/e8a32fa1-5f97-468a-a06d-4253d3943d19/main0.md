# Host-Microbe Mutualism (Wang Lab)

Our competitive Research Intensives program places high-achieving high school students in professional working labs alongside distinguished faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.

**Research Intensive in the Host-Microbe Symbiosis Lab (Wang Lab)**

Plants and animals frequently engage microbes in mutualistic interactions, some of which have significant impacts on our society and the ecosystem. Because such interactions are complex by nature, we are using one well-studied system as an example to probe the molecular mechanisms needed to establish symbiotic relationships in general. Legumes (beans, peas, etc.) play hosts to a class of bacteria that can convert nitrogen in the atmosphere into plant food. This nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is of great importance to sustainable development, and also has medical implications for human health.

Potential projects include discovering novel genes required for this symbiosis, and the effects of specific host proteins on the microbial partner. [*Learn more*](https://www.umass.edu/biochemistry-molecular-biology/about/directory/dong-wang)

The Wang lab can host up to 2 students.

**Program Overview**

During this program, high school students will assist UMass faculty and graduate students in research labs while learning about research methodologies and contributing to ongoing research studies. Each student will create and present a research poster to faculty, fellow students, friends and family at a poster session at the end of the program.

Students will come away with an introduction to the field of Biochemistry, firsthand experience with university-level research, and an understanding of opportunities that exist for undergraduate students at a major R1 university such as UMass Amherst.

**Applications**

For all Research Intensives applications: In your statement of interest, please include 3 lab choices from our [list of available labs](https://www.umass.edu/uww/programs/pre-college/research_intensives) along with a brief explanation of your interest in each one.
