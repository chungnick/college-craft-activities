# Frequently Asked Questions

We’ve gathered the most frequently asked questions here to help you get all the information you need quickly and easily.

## 

* ## Do Summer & September Term courses yield the same credit as courses offered the rest of the year?

  Summer and September Term courses are the equivalent of a full quarter-long course, yielding 100 units of credit.

  Undergraduate courses offered during Summer Term are 3 to 10 weeks in length and meet for approximately 27-30 contact hours, as required by the College.

  Exception: the [Summer Language Institute](/) intensive courses are the equivalent of one full year's worth of language instruction. They are six to eight weeks in length, and yield 300 units of credit.

* ## How will Summer & September courses be graded?

  Summer & September Term courses provide the same undergraduate credit as the rest of the academic year. Students receive a quality letter grade on their University of Chicago transcript.

  Requesting a Pass/Fail: visiting undergraduate, incoming, and UChicago students must approach their instructor no earlier than half-way through the class and no later than the second to last day of class. If the instructor approves the Pass/Fail, they will enter the appropriate grade in Canvas.

  Current UChicago undergraduate students: consult with your College Adviser prior to formally requesting a Pass/Fail to your instructors(s) as some majors limit the number of P marks permitted.

  All general education courses must be taken for quality grades and most courses satisfying requirements in the major must be taken for quality grades.

* ## When and how do I get my grades?

  Grades for all Summer & September courses, regardless of course dates, will be available in mid-September in [Canvas](https://courses.uchicago.edu/).

* ## How do I register for Summer Session programs?

  Application and registration processes vary depending on your student status and on specified program requirements, if any. Please refer to the [Enrollment](/undergraduates/undergrad-student-registration/) Information page for the most accurate information.

* ## May I audit a Summer Session or September Term course?

  Auditing is not allowed for undergraduate courses offered during the Summer Quarter. Students must be fully registered to attend any Summer or September Term course or program.

* ## Can I review a class syllabus?

  Students who would like to review the draft syllabus for a particular class can email [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu)

* ## Can I swap, add, or drop a course?

  **Before the course begins:** UChicago students wishing to swap, add, or drop a course should update their enrollment through [myUChicago.edu](https://portal.uchicago.edu/ais/) as they do during the academic year.

  **Once a course begins, swapping, adding, and dropping courses is limited. Please review the** [**Costs**](/undergraduates/undergraduate-costs/) **page for information about refunds and withdrawals.**

  + UChicago students wishing to enroll in a course that has already met, including the first session, must have the written consent of the instructor. Please forward the instructor consent to Summer Session at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu).
  + Current UChicago undergraduate students can add and/or drop Summer Quarter courses through their My.UChicago account once registration begins on February 17. Once a course has started, course add/drop must be requested via the [Undergraduate Enrollment Change Request form](https://forms.gle/7J7Ce5ajTMKWcvz89).
  + Visiting Students who wish to swap, add, or drop a course should email [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu).
  + Current UChicago graduate students who wish to add or drop should do so through your division's Dean of Students office.

* ## What if I need to withdraw from all of my Summer Session courses?

  Undergraduate students who no longer wish to be enrolled in any Summer Session or September Term courses should send an email to summersession@uchicago.edu. Please include your 8-digit UCID and confirm you do not wish to be enrolled in ANY Summer course. The Summer Session Office will work with the Registrar to update your Term Record and deactivate your summer term.

  UChicago graduate students who wish to drop all of their Summer Quarter courses should do so through their division's Dean of Students office.

  See the Costs page for additional details about refunds and withdrawals.

* ## What happens if the course I want to take is canceled?

  On rare occasions (e.g. an instructor can no longer teach the class; low enrollment in a class), courses are canceled.

  If a course you are enrolled in is canceled, the Summer Session office will notify you and give you the opportunity to enroll in a different course. If you do not wish to enroll in another Summer Session or September Term program or course, program fees will be refunded (including the deposit, if applicable).

* ## Are classes scheduled on holidays?

  Classes are not held when university holidays fall on weekdays. University administrative offices are also closed. If the holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the University will be closed on either Friday or Monday, respectively, in observance of the holiday. You should consult your course syllabus to see how your class schedule will be affected.

  In 2025, there will be no classes on the following holidays:

  + Juneteenth: Thursday, June 19, 2025
  + Independence Day: Friday, July 4, 2025
  + Labor Day: Monday, September 1, 2025

* ## Is simultaneous enrollment permitted?

  Simultaneous enrollment is not allowed.

* ## How many courses can a student take in the Summer Quarter?

  Summer Sessions and September Term courses are on an intensive schedule (two Summer Quarter courses are the equivalent of a full-time course load). We strongly encourage students to enroll in no more than two undergraduate courses in the same session, and no more than five courses over the Summer Quarter. Students wishing to enroll in a 6th course should email [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu).

  Summer Language Institute courses are 300 units. They are therefore considered full-time by themselves.

* ## I am a College student, and the course I need is full. Can I get on a waitlist?

  Current UChicago students: please review [instructions](https://forms.gle/W4Ja2QvhTbCvN9qw7) on how to be placed on a waitlist.

  Visiting Students accepted into a course that has become full will be placed on a waitlist managed by Summer Session staff.

* ## Are housing and dining available?

  A housing and dining plan is available for the duration of the course for students who register in at least one course that meets in-person. Please see more information on the [Summer Housing for Undergraduates](/undergraduates/undergraduate-costs/undergraduate-housing/) page.
