# Summer Session Tuition Benefit Program

Summer Session sponsors the Summer Session Tuition Benefit Program, a 25 percent reduction in tuition costs for up to two Summer Session courses. This program is offered to dependent children of University full-time benefits-eligible faculty, other academic appointees, and staff who are admitted to select Summer Session programs operated by the College.

Depending on the requirements of the particular Summer Session program, interested students must apply to or register for their desired, eligible program(s) and then request the Summer Session Benefit. If the student is admitted, the 25 percent will be applied to the tuition charged for the eligible program(s). The benefit must be requested prior to the Summer Session payment deadlines.

* ## Dependent Child Definition and Alternate Documentation

  The definition of Dependent Children in our Educational Assistance Plan document, available [here](https://humanresources.uchicago.edu/fpg/policies/400/p401.shtml), is as follows: “Dependent Children includes unmarried natural, step- or adopted children, children of your Domestic Partner, and children for whom you are legal guardian." The children are covered to age 25. The children are covered if you are eligible to claim them as dependents on your income taxes.

  If your Dependent Child is not listed as a Dependent in Workday, alternate options for Proof of Relationship may be uploaded in place of this page:

  + Birth certificate
  + Documentation of adoption, or other appropriate legal documents
  + Page one of your most recent federal or state tax return, which must show the child(ren) claimed as a dependent (please redact/cross out wage and social security number information).
