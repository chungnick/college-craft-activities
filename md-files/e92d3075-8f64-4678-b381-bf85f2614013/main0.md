## MATE's Philosophy.

The MATE ROV Competition is about ***student learning***.

It is designed to be an event that challenges students to apply the physics, math, electronics, and engineering skills they are learning in the classroom to solving problems from the workplace.

Mentors (teachers, parents, working professionals) are expected to limit their input to educational and inspiration roles and encouraged to focus on the benefits of the learning process and not simply on "winning" the competition.

#### What is the MATE ROV Competition?

The MATE ROV Competition uses underwater robotics (aka remotely operated vehicles or ROVs) to inspire and challenge students to learn and creatively apply scientific, engineering, and technical skills to solving real-world problems. This competition challenges K-12, community college, and university students from all over the world to tackle missions based on scenarios from the workplace, encouraging students to work together, network, and learn from technical professionals and each other.

#### The ocean we **need** for the future we **want**.

We acknowledge and embrace the UN's "10 Challenges - 10 Years - One Ocean" and task our MATE competition community to design and build a remotely operated vehicle and the necessary sensors, tooling, and complementary technologies to monitor the health of the aquatic habitats of our Blue Planet, so that we can proactively and confidently answer the question "how do we move from the ocean we have to the ocean we want?"

## First Time Diving Into Underwater Robotics?

Immerse yourself in learning with these MATE ROV Academy resources! Let us introduce you to a world of underwater science, technology, engineering and math, and the amazing careers that these skills will prepare you for in the MATE ROV Competition.
