The MATE ROV Competition is excited to announce that the Schmidt Ocean Coalition is generously continuing its support for team travel by funding stipends to the 2025 MATE ROV Competition World Championship in Alpena, MI. This funding is available for new and re-building RANGER, PIONEER, and EXPLORER class teams across the U.S. and around the world!

**Who should apply:** Travel stipends for MATE ROV Competition teams are intended to support a community that:

* Can demonstrate need.
* Actively engage students interested in underwater robotics, providing opportunities to learn and apply scientific, engineering, and technical skills in innovative ways to solve real-world challenges.
* Strive to build a sustainable program that inspires, challenges, and equips students to further their education in ocean technology.

Priority will be given to new teams that demonstrate these qualities in their application.

Travel stipend scholarship amounts will be determined based on each team's application and typically range from $1,000 to $3,000, depending on geographic location and financial need. These stipends are exclusively for covering airfare, ground transportation, and lodging expenses for current team members participating in the 2024-2025 MATE ROV Competition season.

Departure dates will depend on the schedule of each research cruise. We will first select candidates for internships starting in Winter, Spring, and then in Summer and Fall. Applications will stay on file the entire year until all positions have been filled.

The selected interns will work with marine technicians and other crew members on shore and at sea and learn how to operate and maintain a variety of scientific and navigational equipment in support of shipboard scientific research. The program will pay a stipend of $600 per week plus airfare, lodging and other approved travel expenses. Interns will work, eat, and sleep aboard the research vessel, and be provided lodging and a meal plan off ship as needed. Internship projects will vary from one hosting organization to another an correspond to the objectives set by each specific cruise mission. Shipboard sleeping arrangements vary vessel to vessel. Previous interns have worked on cruises to support science projects ranging from chemical oceanography to marine biology, seafloor mapping surveys, geological studies, ROV missions, and much more! *Many successful internships have resulted in job offers.*
