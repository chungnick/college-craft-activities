Team Contacts

***How are teams organized?***   
Organization is a reference for the groups or institutions registering student teams for participation in the program and is largely defined by the type of organization and the physical location. The MATE ROV Competition reserves the right to classify a team’s organization-type based on the available information into the following categories:

**1. School** = A school is an accredited full-time academic institution. A school can be a public school, charter school, private school, or college/university. Teams who are registered by a school must:

* Do all or most of the designing, physical construction, and programming of robots on school grounds
* Be officially sponsored/supported by the school
* Have a faculty member or an authorized agent of the school/institution as the team coach / primary contact who supervises teams during building and during competition events
* Have a school employee/administrator as the Administrator Contact

**2. Independent** = A private group registering as a team typically does most of their robot construction and programming work in a private residence or space. Private teams are generally composed of school-age friends or family members, and do not have open enrollment. These are referred to as “independent” teams.

**3. Homeschool** = A homeschool-based team typically does most of their robot construction and programming work in a private residence or space. Homeschool teams are generally composed of family members, and other students enrolled in homeschool cooperative groups.

**4. Community Group (nonprofit)** = A community group is managed by or run through a non-school community organization such as 4-H, Boys and Girls Club, BSA or Girl Scout troop, community center, etc. Community teams typically meet and work in a public or semi-public location such as a library, community center, or religious center, and students go to that public or semi-public location to participate. Some community teams may include monetary dues. The name of the community organization or registered non-profit organization should be noted in the organization name.

**5. STEM Enrichment Program** (for profit) = Organizations that fall into this category typically charge student registration fees and are managed or run through a business entity. Student enrollment is often done by paid subscription. Teams registered by paid after school STEM enrichment programs and STEM education centers or services fall under this category.

***What are the Organizational Guidelines?***

* Each school in a school district is recognized as a distinct organization and should have their own team number(s).
* Teams that share the same organization address and are involved in the same program are considered one organization.
* Changes to the organizational team affiliation or address must be approved by the MATE ROV Registrar.
* Schools that have a JROTC program can register their JROTC teams as a separate organization if the JROTC teams are run separately from their school programs.

***What is the Organizational Code of Conduct?***  
We appreciate that organizations will follow this policy to the best of their ability, but that due to different circumstances it may be challenging to know if their teams should be classified as one or multiple organizations. If organizations are unclear how they should be categorized, they should contact the MATE Registrar or Regional Coordinator for clarification.

* These guidelines are intended to clarify what constitutes an organization in the context of MATE ROV programs. Teams should not try to find “loopholes” to exploit a competitive advantage.
* An organization’s address may not be changed to provide a team with a competitive advantage by competing in a region that does not match their physical region.
* Intentionally falsifying or omitting information to gain an advantage or bypass limits in the number of teams per organization that can register for events will be treated as a Code of Conduct violation.
* If it is determined that a team intentionally violated the MATE ROV Competition Organizational Policy, MATE will conduct a further review to determine if this is violation of the Code of Conduct and, if so, what course of action may be taken.
* The MATE ROV Competition reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy to best meet the needs of the region.

***What is the Team Numbering System***  
Each organization will be assigned a base identification number. This information will populate our websites, scoresheets, and information displays at events. Teams are identified through an organization’s ID number followed by a letter.

For example, team 0123A has a base number of 0123 (a four-digit series of numbers), and a letter. Team 0123B, team 0123C, etc. are hosted by the same organization. All teams with the same base ID number are connected to the same organization.

Organizations may also have multiple ID numbers as described in the next section. Base numbers belong to the organizations and remain with the organizations if/when coaches leave. Events may have limits to the number of teams from the same organization that may participate. For these situations, organizations with multiple numbers should refrain from using their multiple numbers to bypass those limits.

***How are Team ID Numbers Assigned?***   
ID numbers begin with a four-digit series assigned to them by MATE (e.g. 8675). Each team created by this organization will then be signified with a letter (except O, I, Q, l).

***Who are the Team Contacts?***  
There are a few contact types currently associated with a registered team: Team Coach, Additional Mentor, Student, and Parent/Guardian. MATE has added a registration type for Administrator to process financial transactions on behalf of teams, as needed.

The same individual can register for multiple contact types, when appropriate. All Coaches and Mentors must complete a background check. It is important to note that only the Team Coach or Administrator will have the ability to manage the team in ACTIVE, including registering the team for seasonal events, and modifying team information. If the team is associated with a school, at least one primary contact must be a staff member from that school.

Parents who register students under 18 years old are listed as emergency contacts but are not considered team participants. Parents are allowed to attend events as team chaperones and spectators and may also request a letter of invitation (LOI) through ACTIVE registration for this purpose. All LOI requests will be screened through OFAC for security clearance.

**1. Administrator** (optional) = The team’s Administrator contact is used when there is a centralized person who helps manage multiple teams or provides administrative oversite and funding support. The Administrator may not serve as the Team Coach, but rather as an administrative organizer for teams. Examples of Administrators are:

* A school district STEM Coordinator who pays registration fees for one or more teams at multiple schools within the district.
* A non-profit manager who helps with administration of multiple programs across different sites.
* The Administrator must be an adult (18+ years old) and cannot be a student team member associated with a current team in that program, unless the team is registered for a college/university competition program.
* This contact may overlap with multiple organizations.
* It is the intent of this contact to facilitate team registrations for large, complex institutions such as school districts. It is not the intent of this contact to allow multiple organizations to operate as a single entity to gain any advantage.

**2. Team Coach** (required) = The Team Coach has ultimate decision-making authority regarding all team matters and is the primary point of contact for the team. The Team Coach is typically the “head coach” of the team and is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of all contacts and account attributes. Teams associated with schools require a staff member or an authorized agent of the school as the Team Coach.

* The Team Coach is responsible for registering themselves and the team for the season events.
* The Team Coach may register student team members with parental approval if they are under 18 years of age.
* The Team Coach is responsible for ensuring that MATE ROV Competition Participant Waiver Forms are completed for each student on the team.
* The Team Coach should attend events with the team.
* The Team Coach is the primary person responsible for the students on the team and will be the first person contacted with team-related communications.
* The Team Coach must be an adult (18+ years old) and cannot be a student team member associated with a current team in that program, unless the team is registered for a college/university competition program. In those cases, a student team member 18+ years old may register as the Team Coach and assume all of the responsibilities associated with that role.
* The Team Coach must complete a background check every two years.

**3. Additional Mentor** (optional) = A team’s Secondary Coach or Mentor is an additional individual who will help manage the team but is not required. **Only one Additional Mentor is allowed to register per team. (New in 2026)**

* The Additional Mentor is typically an “assistant coach” or other adult who will assist with the team and/or attend events when the Primary Contact cannot attend.
* The Additional Mentor can complete event registrations and assist with managing MATE ROV Participant Waiver Forms.
* The Additional Mentor must be an adult (18+ years old) and cannot be a student team member associated with a current team in that program unless the team is registered for a college/university competition program.
* The Additional Mentor must complete a background check.

**4. Student** = Student team members may register themselves, or if under 18, through the account of a parent or guardian, to join a registered competition team. Participation waivers must be completed prior to the event under the parent or guardian account, if student is under 18. Communications will be directed to the parent or guardian associated with registered minor students.

* Graduate students are NOT eligible to compete as student team members but are welcome to serve as team mentors or Coaches. Graduate students are encouraged to contribute to the team via advice and technical assistance.
* Students must fall within the eligible grade levels per competition class, and if minors, students must work under the supervision of a responsible adult mentor.
* Teams can consist of students from different schools and/or grade levels registered under the same organization.
* Teams must have at least three students with a maximum of 30 registered students. Teams wishing to register more than 30 students should contact the MATE Registrar or Regional Coordinator.
* Teams must consist of the same student team roster as registered for the regional competition and those advancing to the World Championship.
* Substitutions to the student team roster are allowed **only if the student substitution is registered to a team under the same organization and competes in the same competition class**.
