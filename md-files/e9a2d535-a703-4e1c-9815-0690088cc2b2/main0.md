Academies are subject-intensive programs that fuse sophisticated scientific or social theory with relevant applications. The science academies draw upon Penn's cutting-edge technology and resources to provide innovative lab experiences while the humanities academies draw upon the rich history of Philadelphia to provide a sociologically comprehensive summer experience. Academies are led by University of Pennsylvania faculty and long-standing professionals in their field of study with support from graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants. Upon successful completion of the program, students are awarded a Certificate of Completion and may request letters of recommendation from their Penn instructors.
