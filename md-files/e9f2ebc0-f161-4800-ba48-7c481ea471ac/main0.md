## Self-made Engineering Leaders of the Future (SELF) for High School Students

## Connecting rural students to STEM careers through research, mentoring and community service in forest bio-products

The Self-made Engineering Leaders of the Future (SELF) Institute is a residential program for Maine’s rural high school students. The week-long program will focus on the responsible use of forest ecosystems as a building block for sustainable and renewable energy. Students will explore cutting-edge forest bioproducts research at the University of Maine by participating in demonstrations, hands-on projects and field trips. Participants will also have recreational activities at the New Balance Student Recreation Center.

This program started as a partnership between College of Engineering, Forest Bioproducts Research Institute and University of Maine Cooperative Extension 4-H funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA.
