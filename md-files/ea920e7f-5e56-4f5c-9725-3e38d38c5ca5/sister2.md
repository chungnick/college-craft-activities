This is the application for the Academies. If admitted, you will be able to register for any of our Academies (as availability allows).

Registration is conducted on a first-come, first-served basis, and to secure a seat in your chosen program, you must register and submit tuition payment.

#### IMPORTANT

Upon starting your application, you will receive a NetID and GUID. A NetID (username) is the login credential that will allow you to access the various electronic resources made available to you while participating in our program. Your single-use password is “gu + the last 6 digits of your GUID”, and will expire after logging in with it for the first time.

You are REQUIRED to enroll in Georgetown’s Duo two-factor authentication service, install Duo on your mobile device (you’ll use this device to approve login push notifications from Duo), enroll in Georgetown’s online password management system, and change your single-use password using the [password management system.](https://uis.georgetown.edu/netid-passwords/changing-your-password-new-to-gu/?_gl=1*1drgtfr*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTUwOTI0MjUuQ2p3S0NBanc3X0RFQmhBZUVpd0FXS2lDQzRfWEgtR09NaWJMLWhUaXp3RnIxSk51SFduOHZ3SFdqTVZmU01ULWZTSFpJT0ZScGxURUtCb0NHSTRRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MjgyMDc0NjUyLjE3NTIxNjkyODQuMTgwMDQwMjY1MC4xNzU1MTkyMTYwLjE3NTUxOTIxNTk.*_ga*ODI0MjUzODIzLjE3NTE5OTY3MzQ.*_ga_DZ43RB0PLG*czE3NTY4MTgyODAkbzM4JGcxJHQxNzU2ODIwMjg2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..)
