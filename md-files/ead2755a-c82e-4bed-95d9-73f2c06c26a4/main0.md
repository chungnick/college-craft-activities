# WiSTEM: Where Curiosity Meets Innovation!

We’re not just about science, technology, engineering, and math—we’re about unleashing the power of curiosity. Imagine a vibrant community where inspired minds collide, where STEM leaders emerge with confidence and passion.

Our Mission: To ignite the spark in every student, regardless of gender, and propel them toward STEM greatness. From pre-college to undergraduates, we’re here to fuel your STEM journey.

WiSTEM is a self-sustaining unit of the university with programs open to all students of any gender. Learn more [about WiSTEM](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/about-wistem/) and [get involved](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/engage-with-wistem/)!
