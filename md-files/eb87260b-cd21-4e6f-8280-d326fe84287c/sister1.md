# Coding for Game Design High School Summer Program

### Summer 2026 is open for applications!

In Summer 2026, we offer **two in-person sessions**. Each session will be two weeks long. In each session, participants will learn about the principles of game design and be introduced to **C#** and **Unity** scripting, which they will use to create their own games! The program emphasizes **team collaboration** and close work with experienced game designers and developers. Students will work together and independently to create 2D Unity games based on design principles and development techniques used by professionals at NYU.

Starting from Summer 2026, this program will introduce a new workshop on how to effectively use Generative AI for game development. This component does not aim to replace the fundamentals of coding skills, which continue to be the focus in this program. However, it offers additional resources to effectively and ethically navigate AI technology and become better designers and programmers in the age of technology.  

In each assignment, students are encouraged to use tools at their disposal, including Generative AI, to further their knowledge and grow their skills with Unity and C#.

### Join us and learn from game designers & coding experts on how to design your own games!

Our program is accepting students who will be **entering sophomore, junior, or senior year** of high school in Fall 2026.
