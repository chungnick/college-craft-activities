Enduring Bonds

View More

Entering the Crimson Summer Academy means joining a community of learners. It’s a way to meet and stay connected with other academically ambitious students all through high school and beyond. The mentoring relationships established during the first summer between Harvard undergraduates and Crimson Scholars continue throughout the academic year.

The Academy community also gathers regularly for special events and graduates of the CSA now comprise a network of success that benefits current Scholars in myriad ways. Our commitment to Crimson Scholars doesn’t end when autumn begins. Our commitment is deep and long-lasting.

> The community made me want to succeed and no other program could have motivated me more. I am grateful to every person I got to know during my time with the program and I recognize that I am where I am because of them.

## Courses

The interdisciplinary curriculum focuses on asking and answering questions designed to help young people think deeply about their world and their ability to impact the future.

Because the Academy is committed to helping students make informed decisions and participate in democracy as active thinkers and leaders, the curriculum focuses on what it means to be a responsible young person in an interconnected world.

Because the Academy considers successful admission to college a necessary step on the road to personal success, a course called “College Planning and Preparation” is a fundamental part of the curriculum, as is another called “Financial Literacy.” Recognizing the importance of emotional wellbeing, all Scholars also take a Wellness course.

The Academy’s integrated course of study continues from the first summer to the second. In the third summer, Crimson Scholars take courses at the Harvard Summer School, for which they receive college credit.

Career Exploration Fieldwork

View More

Career Exploration Fieldwork, offered during the Academy’s second summer, provides Crimson Scholars the opportunity to broaden their knowledge of post-college options during focused, small-group field trips designed to maximize the attention they receive from high-level professionals, who discuss with the Scholars their own struggles, successes, and professional realities while informing them of the vast and often surprising opportunities available to them.

Field work has included visits to Google, Uber, Sasaki Associates, VistaPrint, WGBH, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the Moakley Courthouse, the Massachusetts Statehouse, and many others.

College Planning & Preparation

View More

The CSA College Planning & Preparation sequence helps prepare students to become viable candidates for admission to a range of challenging four-year colleges and universities by focusing on the students’ academic needs and concerns and by educating them about the college application process. There are many strategies and suggestions from which all CSA students benefit, but both summers of CPP also address how this information can be incorporated into each student’s complex and unique life.

The first summer’s curriculum is designed to meet the demands of the sophomore year of high school, while taking into account the varied experiences that each student brings to the Academy. The second summer is designed to coincide with CSA’s Career Exploration Fieldwork. Junior Scholars examine their passions and see how they might translate into career interests. Other topics covered in depth include developing leadership skills within the community and understanding the complex process of college admissions. The CPP sequence uses seminar discussion, workshops, and one-on-one conferences to make sure that every student ends each summer with a clear plan for the coming year.

Financial Literacy

View More

In this course, students will learn the essential skills and knowledge necessary to manage their personal finances effectively. Topics covered will include banking, budgeting, saving, credit, and debt management. We will offer cover financial aid and how class economics interacts with your college experience.

Students will begin by understanding their current economic and financial climate. They will then learn how to create a spending plan, track their spending, and the conventions for saving money for both short-term and long-term goals.

The course will also cover strategies for managing debt, including credit card debt, student loans, and mortgages. Students will learn strategies to generate and sustain a good credit score along with the components of credit reports.

Students will briefly learn about the difference between investing and trading while touching upon the fundamentals of both.

Each unit will be grounded in both theory and practice while also discussing the interaction between economics, public policy and self.

Throughout the course, students will develop practical skills and knowledge that they can use to take control of their finances and make life-long informed financial decisions.

Writing

View More

In the CSA Writing courses, Scholars work on becoming more confident writers through practice, skill-building, and presentation. They craft products in different genres as they think their way to understanding, always engaging deeply with rich texts.

* What does it take to craft and defend a quality literacy narrative or academic essay?
* What are strategies to read difficult texts, and to use passages from them as evidence to make one’s own argument?
* How is writing an academic essay like having a really good conversation?
* What does it take to not only craft a technically correct piece of expository writing, but to give it voice and make it say something interesting, important and unique?
* What role does the awareness of audience play when we write?

Through studies of strategies like annotation, close reading and summarizing, CSA Scholars learn how to focus when reading a difficult text, figure out what the author is saying, and develop a response. Through critical reading, brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing, conferencing and workshopping their writing, Scholars develop the skills to write with conviction and clarity. Taken all together, Scholars learn more about academic writing that is evidence-based, full of heart, and skillfully shares what they care about with an audience of readers.
