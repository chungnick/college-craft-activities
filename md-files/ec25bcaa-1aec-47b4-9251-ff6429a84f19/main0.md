# Quantum Quickstart

Course Status: Open

Pre-college applications are now open. Join us this coming summer!

## Course Description

Quantum mechanics has reshaped how we see the world around us, being hailed as a science with the potential to fundamentally redefine the technological landscape and our society. Information encoded in quantum bits is known to be completely secure from hacking; computers running on quantum algorithms can solve problems that no classical computer could ever solve; and quantum systems enable the world’s most precise measurements.

The Quantum Quickstart program offers the opportunity for a diverse cohort of outstanding high school students with a passion for STEM to be exposed to the great scientific advances in quantum sciences and the physical foundations of quantum mechanics via lectures with faculty in the [Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering](https://pme.uchicago.edu/), theoretical discussions, and tours of world-class lab facilities. Participants will see the inner workings of quantum computers, learn about quantum engineering’s rollout to the consumer market.

In addition to seeing the world through a quantum lens, students will also attend sessions to prepare for future careers in STEM and meet with UChicago admissions counselors to learn about highly selective college admissions. This program is not for credit and participation in all sessions is required to receive the program certificate.

The program will be hosted on-campus, and program participants must reside in campus housing for the duration of the program.
