# Pre-College Frequently Asked Questions

We’ve compiled answers to the most common questions from students and parents to give you a clear understanding of what to expect—from application requirements to academics and campus life to program logistics. Our goal is to help you navigate Summer Programs easily so you can focus on what matters most: making the most of your summer experience at UChicago.

## 

* ## Should I apply for more than one course? What happens if the course(s) I want to take are full?

  Yes, you are advised to apply to multiple courses or programs on your application. If your first choice is full, we will review your application and consider you for placement in other courses you listed. Complete your application as soon as possible for the best chance to take your preferred class! Students admitted to Summer Session are admitted to one course or one program in total for the Summer.

* ## I attended the program last summer; how do I reapply?

  Students who have attended a previous Summer Session should complete a new application by providing their personal information in the online application along with the application fee and an updated complete high school transcript. Other materials do not need to be resubmitted. Returning applicants should also submit an essay indicating their interest in the current courses they are applying to, but do not need to respond to the second essay, solicit new recommendations, or submit another graded writing sample. Simply enter "Summer 2025" as the first/last names of the recommenders and in the essay fields, unless you wish to have new recommendation letters submitted for the current application.

  Exception: Applicants to the Research in the Biological Sciences (RIBS) program must submit an entirely new application, including essays, recommendations, and transcripts, even if they attended another Summer Session program.

* ## My parent or guardian has not received the parent confirmation or the parental permission and release emails. What should I do?

  Contact us at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto: summersession@uchicago.edu) and we will resend the emails. Some emails have strong blocking systems, so please check your spam filters. Only students in Pre-College programs require the parent/guardian confirmation.

* ## My recommender did not receive the link to the recommendation. What should I do?

  Contact us at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto: summersession@uchicago.edu). Include your name, the recommender's name, and the recommender’s email, and we will resend the request.

* ## Should I wait until my recommendation has been submitted before submitting my application?

  No, the letters can be added to your application once they are submitted. You do not need to wait to submit your application, but we will not be able to review your application until we receive at least one letter of recommendation.

* ## I have attended more than one school since 9th grade. What transcript(s) should I send?

  For Pre-College students. Transcripts should include the student's entire academic record since the 9th grade, as applicable. Students who have attended more than one school since the beginning of the 9th grade should submit one official transcript for each school they attended. Students who are currently in 9th grade should also submit their grades from the 8th grade.

  For Visiting Undergraduate students, please include your full undergraduate transcript.

* ## Can I upload documents after I submit my application?

  You can upload test scores and any updated documents to your UChicago Account at any time by clicking “Upload Materials.”

* ## Are undocumented students eligible for admission to Summer Session?

  At the University of Chicago, we are committed to creating a diverse campus community. All students who apply, regardless of citizenship are considered for admission and aid. Former President Robert J. Zimmer issued a statement confirming the University’s commitment to our members of the community with undocumented immigration status or who qualify for relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. You may read the [entire message online](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/message-regarding-immigration) and please don’t hesitate to contact us at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu) if you have any questions or concerns.

* ## How can I apply as a commuter student?

  Students applying to a 2 week Career Insight course or a 3 Week Immersion course, and who live in the Chicagoland area, are eligible to commute each day to class rather than live in residence on campus. If you would like to commute, you can indicate this preference on the "Supplement" page of the application. Please make sure you are aware of the cost and policies for [commuting to campus](/pre-college/student-life/commuting-to-campus/).

## 

* ## Am I eligible for a scholarship or financial aid?

  For Pre-College students, UChicago Summer Session awards need-based financial aid based upon an applicant’s demonstrated financial need. Students applying for such aid must complete a financial aid application as part of their admissions application so that the award determination can be included in the offer of admission. Please note that students who are admitted to a residential program, and then decide to take a remote course or commute will have their financial aid awards reassessed. Please review the prescribed aid students can expect to receive based upon household income on our [Costs page](/pre-college/pre-college-costs/).

* ## What will be my total bill?

  More information about your bill can be found on the [Costs page](/pre-college/pre-college-costs/). Costs will vary by program and whether you are enrolled in a residential program.

* ## When and how do I pay my bill?

  For pre-college students:

  + Within one week of admittance, we require a deposit of $1,000 on the student’s UChicago Account. This payment holds a student’s place in the program and can be paid using a credit card.
  + The full balance will be due within four weeks of being admitted to Summer Session.

* ## Does the program fee include health insurance?

  For students enrolled in 3 and 4 Week Residential programs, the University of Chicago automatically provides "blanket" accident, injury, and sickness insurance coverage for all Summer Session students. This coverage will be in addition to any primary health insurance students may already have. The cost of this insurance is included in the program fee.

  Students who are enrolled in 1 and 2 Week Residential programs will need to provide for their own insurance coverage while they are on campus.

  Students who are enrolled in Remote programs will not have access to insurance coverage.

* ## My plans for the summer have changed. How do I withdraw from the program?

  All students who have confirmed their admission will be registered for their course(s); if you decide [to withdraw](/pre-college/pre-college-costs/) after you have sent in your confirmation form and deposit, you must email [summersession@uchicago.edu](https://summer.uchicago.edu/summersession@uchicago.edu) with an official withdrawal request. Students will be billed for the program fee if they have not officially withdrawn.

  **Please note**: Verbally informing an instructor or not attending classes does not constitute an official withdrawal.

* ## Is my enrollment deposit refundable?

  Enrollment deposits will be [refunded](/pre-college/pre-college-costs/) only if a course or program is cancelled by Summer Session, and the student does not select another course or program to attend in its place. The application fee and the $1,000 enrollment deposit is non-refundable if a student decides to withdraw from a program.

* ## Is my program fee refundable?

  Depending on the program and proximity to the start date, students may be eligible for [partial or complete refunds](/pre-college/pre-college-costs/). The refund does not include the $1,000 deposit or the application fee.

* ## Is Summer Session financial aid taxable?

  The aid you receive from Summer Session may be taxable. Consult with a tax professional for more information on your specific situation.

* ## Can I use my 529 account to pay for Summer Session?

  You will need to confirm with your 529 plan administrator about whether your funds can be used for Summer Session. Please note that the University does not provide 1098-T tuition tax forms for non–degree students, which includes Summer Session. If you do wish to pay with your 529 account, please contact Summer Session for instructions.

## Residential Programs FAQ

## Course Information and Credit

* ## How long will I be in class? How much homework will I have?

  **1 Week Programs**  
  Individual schedules for each Enrichment course will vary, but a typical day will begin at 9:00 a.m. with lectures, discussion sections, or workshops. Afternoons typically consist of an on-campus tour, excursion to another part of the city, or hands-on activity related to the subject area of the program. Evenings include activities and events planned by residential and program staff, or open social time.

  **2 Weeks Programs**  
  Students should expect to have a full day (5-6 hours) of course-related activity, Monday through Friday.

  **3-4 Week Programs**  
  Because these Summer Session courses are equivalent to courses that last nine weeks during the rest of the academic year, the courses are intensive and rigorous. Students should expect to have a full day (5-6 hours) of course-related activity, Monday through Friday. For every course, you will have daily homework assignments, such as reading or problem sets, as well as more long-term assignments such as research projects, papers to write, or exams to study for.

  Some courses will have course considerations such as "reading intensive," "writing intensive," "discussion intensive," "math intensive," and "coding intensive" to help you understand the nature of the work or how the work will be focused in class.

* ## What is your attendance policy?

  Regular class attendance, timely completion of work, and participation are required. Failure to meet these standards may result in probation or dismissal.

  Students in 3 and 4 Week programs are required to take all classes for a quality letter grade and missing more than a day will have a significant impact on your grade for the class. Each Summer Session course is equivalent to 9 weeks of undergraduate coursework. Because Summer courses are condensed, 1-2 days of class is equivalent to an entire week of instruction during the regular academic year, so attendance and timely completion of work is critical. Summer Session courses and grades are recorded on a UChicago transcript; college applications, including the Common App, will require you to submit this transcript when you apply to colleges.

  Students in 1 and 2 Week programs are required to be in attendance every day and will be expected to participate fully. Students who fail to be in attendance each day will not be issued a certificate.

* ## I require accommodations (such as extra time on exams, note taking, etc.). How do I request these for my Summer Session course?

  **Students in 3-8 Week programs:** Students enrolled in 3 week Immersion, 4 week Practicum (RIBS, Stones and Bones) who are requesting accommodations should complete the accommodations application process through UChicago Student Disability Services (SDS): <https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/students/registering-with-sds/>.

  For example, if you have received a 504/IEP at your current school, or otherwise believe that you might need accommodations, you are encouraged to engage in the interactive process to register with SDS. SDS processes requests in the order of which they are received. As outlined on the SDS [website](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/students/registering-with-sds/), reviewing documentation and scheduling intake appointments can take approximately one to two weeks, depending on the volume of requests. Students who are interested in applying for supports/services are encouraged to initiate the process to register for supports/services as early as possible. Please contact Student Disability Services at [disabilities@uchicago.edu](mailto:disabilities@uchicago.edu) or at [(773) 702-6000](tel:7737026000) with any questions.

  **Students in 1-2 week programs:** Students enrolled in 1-2 week programs who are requesting accommodations should email Summer Session Office directly at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:summersession@uchicago.edu) 3-4 weeks prior to the start of the program.

* ## Can I change courses (add/drop) during the summer?

  Because Summer Session courses are brief and very intensive, we strongly encourage students to consider their choices very carefully before they apply. Course changes in must be made before the second class meeting of the course.

  Students in 2 Week Career Insight or 3 Week Immersion will only be allowed to add/drop under very special circumstances once courses have begun. All changes must be approved by the Summer Session program staff at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:%20summersession@uchicago.edu).

  Students in 1 Week Enrichment or 4 Week Practicum programs are not permitted to change their course or program.

* ## What if the course I want to take is cancelled?

  Very occasionally, because of a significant conflict or because an insufficient number of students have enrolled in a class, a course is cancelled. Students who are registered in a cancelled class will be contacted by Summer Session and offered the opportunity to enroll in an alternative course or program. If a student does not wish to take another course in its place, the student's deposit and program fee will be refunded. A course cancellation will be announced at least two weeks prior to the start of the course.

* ## Are there classes on Juneteenth or July 4 (Independence Day)?

  Classes will not be held on either June 19 for Juneteenth or July 4, and University administrative offices will also be closed. Students should expect to be in class on the days surrounding the holiday unless an instructor says otherwise.

* ## Can I get my books before classes start?

  In mid-May, students in 3 and 4 Week courses can see if their course requires a textbook by searching the Bookstore's and Seminary Co-op websites. Many courses have readings that are available entirely online via Canvas that requires a cNet ID and password.

  Residential students are not expected to have their books before they arrive, unless the course instructor says otherwise. Students will have time during orientation weekend to purchase assigned course books.

* ## Do I need a computer?

  Students are strongly advised to bring their own laptops with them. While there are computers and printing facilities available for student use throughout campus, students often find it is best to bring their own. Some courses require students to bring a laptop to class. The main campus computing clusters support both PC and Mac platforms. All areas on campus are configured for wireless internet access. Please note that there is a nominal fee for printing via campus facilities; see [https://printing.uchicago.edu](https://printing.uchicago.edu/) for details.

* ## Are Summer Session courses for credit?

  Courses in 3 and 4 Week Programs are graded (A-F), carry at least 100 units of credit, and have undergraduate-level course numbers. It's important to note that, as opposed to many universities that structure their calendars by semesters, the University of Chicago operates on a quarter system. Each University of Chicago 100-unit course is the equivalent of 3.3 semester credit hours.

  + 3 Week Immersion: 100 UChicago units = 5 quarter hours = 3.3 semester hours
  + 4 Week: 200 UChicago units = 10 quarter hours = 6.6 semester hours

  The 1 and 2 Week programs do not carry any credit.

* ## How do I order or view my transcript?

  For students in 3 and 4 Week programs, to order transcripts, please log in to your [myUChicago](https://my.uchicago.edu/) to view and request a transcript from the [Registrar's Office](https://registrar.uchicago.edu/). The Summer Session Office cannot issue transcripts; only the Registrar's Office can act in this capacity. (Students will be notified when transcripts are ready to order at the end of Summer Quarter in early September.)

  On your my.uchicago account, you should be able to request an official transcript by following these directions:  
  Students should select Academics (on the top left of the page) --> Academic Records --> Request Official Transcript

  If you do not have access to your CNET ID, you can request transcript through Parchment here: <https://registrar.uchicago.edu/records/transcripts/>

* ## How do I transfer credit from Summer Session courses to another university?

  Students interested in transferring UChicago credit earned via the 3 and 4 Week Programs should contact the university where you would want the credit to be applied about their requirements for doing so. Transfer of credit is at the discretion of the recipient university. You will be able to request your transcript via your MyUChicago account after the summer quarter ends in late August.

* ## If I take a UChicago Summer Session course for credit and eventually attend UChicago as an undergraduate, do those credits count towards my graduation requirements?

  Unfortunately, these courses do not count toward graduation requirements. During the summer immediately prior to matriculation, incoming students are permitted to take University of Chicago courses. These will confer College credit. Incoming students will be notified of their options from Summer Session after their enrollment is complete.

## Preparing to Arrive on Campus

* ## I'm flying from O'Hare/Midway, how do I get to campus?

  1 Week Enrichment  
  There are two major commercial airports in the Chicago area: O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport. O'Hare International Airport is about 30 miles northwest of campus, and Midway International Airport is approximately eight miles west of the UChicago campus. A staff member will greet students at the airport and lead them to our shuttle service.

  2-4 Week Programs  
  There are two major commercial airports in the Chicago area: O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport. O'Hare International Airport is about 30 miles northwest of campus, and Midway International Airport is approximately eight miles west of the UChicago campus. Students flying into O'Hare airport on June 14 or July 7 have the option for shuttle service to campus with other UChicago Summer Session students. A staff member will greet them at the airport and lead them to our shuttle service. An additional fee is associated with this service. Students are also welcome to use another mode of transportation to get to campus, including public transit, shuttle, car, taxi, Uber, or Lyft.

* ## I am a student under the age of 18 flying for my Summer Session program. Do I have to make special arrangements for my flight?

  Please take extra precautions to verify an airline's age policy before purchasing tickets as different airlines have different policies regarding the minimum age to fly unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. Summer Session staff cannot pick up students at their gates. Staff meet students at a prearranged airport location.

* ## Can I check in a day early or stay an extra day at my residence hall?

  Unfortunately, we are unable to offer additional housing outside of the program dates, as we have several other programs running throughout the summer. If you require accommodations before or after your course, you will need to make independent arrangements. Summer Session students are welcome to move in on the first day of their orientation and remain in housing for the duration of their session. All Summer Session students must follow the same move-in and move-out schedule as outlined for their program.

* ## I'm under 18 and would like to arrive early or stay an extra day or two for Summer Session. May I stay at nearby hotels prior to check in?

  Summer Session students and families should note that the minimum age necessary rent a hotel room or Airbnb is 18 years of age. Students under 18 cannot rent and stay in a hotel room on their own, and so should not arrive in Chicago before or stay past the check-in and check-out dates stated in their admissions materials unless they will have a parent or guardian with them.

  We have several different programs running during the summer. There is no additional capacity prior to the start of a course or afterwards. Students cannot check in to the residence hall before the official check-in date and cannot stay in the residence hall after the official check-out date given in their admissions materials. Unfortunately, there can be no exceptions. This rule applies to all students, regardless of age. Summer Session students and families should make travel plans accordingly.

## Housing & Student Life

* ## What will I do outside of class, including nights and weekends?

  The residential staff plans and leads daily activities for students to get to know each other, the campus, the neighborhood, and the city of Chicago. Students can pick and choose from a variety of programs to suit a wide range of interests, including low and no-cost programs. Previous events include trips to Major League Baseball games, the Taste of Chicago festival, evening soccer, museum outings, beach trips, Movies on the Midway, and much more. All events are planned and led by residential staff members.

* ## What facilities are available during the summer?

  Students enrolled in 3 and 4 Week Programs may access University amenities while they are attending courses. The Student Services Fee provides access to resources like Student Health & Counseling Services, libraries, and more. Students participating in the 1 and 2 Week Programs have access to the residence hall and dining hall, library and other campus spaces, as needed.

* ## When is orientation and when can I move in?

  Orientation dates are listed below. All pre-college Summer Session students - residential or commuter - must attend orientation. Residential students must attend the entirety of both days of orientation. Commuter students are required to attend the first day of orientation only.

  #### Orientation dates

  + Session I: Saturday-Sunday, June 13 - 14, 2026
  + Session II: Sunday-Monday, July 5 - 6, 2026

  1 Week Enrichment students will move in the day before their program begins and move out on the last day of the program. Make sure to review your program page for specific move in and move out dates.

* ## Can parents and families attend orientation?

  Unfortunately, no. Only students can attend orientation; family members who travel with their student should plan to depart from campus once their student has moved in to the residence hall. Parents and families will be invited to attend a virtual information session before students arrive on campus.

  Students will attend required Orientation sessions after drop-off, and will not be available to be exempted from curfew or dine off-campus with families during Orientation.

* ## When do I need to move out?

  1 Week Enrichment students will move in the day before their program begins and move out on the last day of the program. Make sure to review your program page for specific move in and move out dates.

  Students in 2-4 Week Programs must check out of the residence hall by 9:00 a.m. by the day after their course ends, unless otherwise instructed. Students may check out in the evening on the day their course ends, but must have a Curfew Release Form on file 24 hours in advance and be sure not to miss any required course activities or exams on the last day. Please see [Residential and Campus Life](/pre-college/student-life/residential-and-campus-life/) for more information.

* ## Can I live off campus?

  While most of the students in our in-person pre-college programs stay in on-campus housing, 2 and 3 Week students who permanently live in the Chicagoland area are welcome to commute!

  Commuter students eat lunch with their peers each class day in the dining hall. They may also choose to participate in program activities and excursions outside of class, including late afternoon activities, that take place right after class, as well as evenings and weekends.

  Only students in the 2 and 3 Week programs who live in the Chicago area have the option to commute. Students admitted to 1 Week and 4 Week programs are required to live in on-campus housing, as are students who do not live locally with their parent(s) or guardian(s).

  Please note that students who live on-campus gain the full benefit of academic support, building community and making friends with peers, and experiencing the life of a college student.

* ## What is the residential staff like?

  Our residential team is composed of current undergraduates and recent alumni of the University of Chicago. Our RAs are here to make students feel comfortable in the residence halls, and to assist them with academic, residential, and co-curricular matters. Several RAs reside in each House on the same floor as the students. Our Residential Director and Assistant Residential Directors are available to students and their families 24 hours a day.

* ## Can I live in the residence hall and take remote courses?

  No, students must be taking in-person courses to live in the residence hall. Students in remote programs cannot live in the residence hall.

* ## What should I pack?

  Chicago weather in the summer can fluctuate, so prepare for the possibility of high heat, as high as 90-95 degrees Fahrenheit/33-35 degrees Celsius, and humidity.

  The residence halls are air-conditioned, and some students find it chilly. If you think you would like more than one pillow, a heavier weight blanket, or a larger towel, please bring these items with you or plan to purchase them after you arrive. All beds are extra-long single beds (36" x 80"). Please note that laundry facilities, including washing machines and dryers, are available.

  We recommend that you pack the following items for your stay:

  \*\*Computing facilities (including pay-per-use printers) are available on campus, but you may bring your own if you wish. WiFi is available in all campus buildings.

* ## What is the curfew policy for students living on-campus?

  High school students living in the residence hall must sign in for curfew every night. Following the City of Chicago curfew ordinance, summer residents must be inside the residence hall from 10:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m. Disregard for curfew can be grounds for dismissal from the program. Students who miss curfew sign-in will be subject to disciplinary action, and their parents will be contacted. Please see the Academic, Social, and Residential Policies for more information about the curfew policy.

  Parents may give permission for their child to miss curfew if the student is accompanied by an adult. Parents should complete an accurate Curfew Release Form at least 24 hours prior to the requested release time.

* ## How do I get my mail? Can I ship items to myself?

  Specific addresses will be provided prior to the start of the program.

  Mail is delivered once a day, Monday through Friday. Mail can be picked up at the front desk 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The front desk will sign for all priority packages.

  Packages that arrive prior to your arrival date or after your departure date will be returned to the sender.

* ## Can I have a friend or relative stay overnight in my residence hall room?

  While guests are welcome to visit, they cannot stay overnight in student rooms. All guests must check-in at the front desk, and must check out by 10:00 p.m. High School Program residents may not have non-program guests in their rooms past curfew, including relatives.

* ## What if I need medical care?

  Students in 3-4 Week programs have access to medical facilities, including the Student Health Services and an on-call physician for after business hours care. If a student requires immediate medical attention, the University of Chicago's Medical Center is on campus. Residential staff members will be available 24/7 to help in the case of any emergency and will contact the parent or guardian. All parents of minors are required to submit a release form authorizing necessary medical treatment in the case that the parent/guardian cannot be reached. This release is provided to parents after their student has been accepted to the program.

  If a student in a 1 or 2 Week program requires immediate medical attention, the University of Chicago's Medical Center is on campus. Residential staff members will be available 24/7 to help in the case of any emergency and will contact the parent or guardian. All parents of minors are required to submit a release form authorizing necessary medical treatment in the case that the parent/guardian cannot be reached. This release is provided to parents after their student has been accepted to the program. 1 and 2 Week program participants must have their own valid U.S. health insurance.

* ## What safety resources are available?

  To ensure the safety and convenience of our students, faculty, staff, and community, UChicago's Department of Safety & Security provides residence security, transportation, and 24/7 support. Residence halls are always fully staffed with security personnel, and all entrances and exits are fully secured. Summer Session residential students verify their identity with their University ID at the front desk upon entry to the residence hall. For transportation, UGo Daytime and NightRide shuttles pick-up and drop-off within one or two blocks of residential and academic buildings around all of campus. Summer Session students may contact the UChicago Police Department at any time, day or night, by dialing 773.702.8181 or 123 from a campus phone.

* ## What if there is an emergency on campus?

  Campus safety for all is a top priority at the University of Chicago. Support is available 24/7, including health care, mental wellness, and a dean-on-call. For non-threatening situations on campus or in the residence halls, students will be able to utilize either their Resident Assistant, Summer Program staff, or the Campus Residential Hall front desk. If a serious situation arises, students should contact the dean-on-call or the University Police 24/7.

## Remote Programs

## Course Information and Credit

* ## What will my online course be like? What sorts of things will we do in class?

  Online courses combine synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (on your own time) activities. Synchronous activities, like lectures, discussions, and projects, happen via Zoom and resemble traditional classroom experiences. Asynchronous activities include tasks such as readings, problem sets, and writing papers, as well as online-specific tasks like discussion boards, videos, or virtual experiments. Your instructor and TA will ensure active engagement with both the subject and your classmates throughout the course.

* ## What is the attendance policy?

  Regular class attendance, timely completion of work, and participation are required. Failure to meet these standards may result in probation or dismissal. Students are required to take all classes for a quality letter grade and missing more than a day will have a significant impact on your grade for the class. Each Summer Session course is equivalent to 9 weeks of undergraduate coursework. Because Summer courses are condensed, 1-2 days of class is equivalent to an entire week of instruction during the regular academic year, so attendance and timely completion of work is critical. Summer Session courses and grades are recorded on a UChicago transcript; college applications, including the Common App, will require you to submit this transcript when you apply to colleges.

* ## How long will I be in class? How much homework will be assigned?

  Because Summer Session courses are equivalent to courses that last nine weeks during the rest of the academic year, the courses are intensive and rigorous. All programs will have daily homework assignments, such as reading or problem sets, as well as more long-term assignments such as research projects, papers to write, or exams to study for.

  Please consult the days and times listed under the descriptions of your courses, as your daily schedule will depend on your selected classes. Some courses will have course considerations such as "reading intensive," "writing intensive," "discussion intensive," "math intensive," and "coding intensive" to help you understand the nature of the work or how the work will be focused in class.

* ## I require some accommodations (such as extra time on exams, note taking, etc.). How do I request these for my Summer Session course?

  Students enrolled in Summer Online should complete the accommodations application process through UChicago Student Disability Services (SDS): <https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/students/registering-with-sds/>.

  For example, if you have received a 504/IEP at your current school, or otherwise believe that you might need accommodations, you are encouraged to engage in the interactive process to register with SDS. SDS processes requests in the order of which they are received. As outlined on the SDS [website](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/students/registering-with-sds/), reviewing documentation and scheduling intake appointments can take approximately one to two weeks, depending on the volume of requests. Students who are interested in applying for supports/services are encouraged to initiate the process to register for supports/services as early as possible. Please contact Student Disability Services at [disabilities@uchicago.edu](mailto:disabilities@uchicago.edu) or at [(773) 702-6000](tel:7737026000) with any questions.

* ## How can I best prepare for success in my online course?

  The same traits that help you succeed in traditional classes—organization, discipline, and adaptability—will serve you well online. Starting in early June, you'll have access to resources and training on Zoom and Canvas to ease the transition to remote learning. Once classes begin, virtual workshops on library resources, study skills, and academic assignments will be available. Summer Session staff and Teaching Assistants will also offer support to students needing help with time management, academic expectations, or course content.

  The University has also launched the [Learning Remotely site](https://learningremotely.uchicago.edu/), which we suggest that you review before classes begin. In particular, the Getting Started page contains information like what internet connection speed you will need to be able to participate in online classes and how to improve your internet connection. Spending time on this website before your class begins will help you start on the right foot.

  Participation will be a part of your grade in every remotely taught course, and will be determined by factors such as your contributions to online discussion boards, projects, and other activities, as well as your dedication to engaging the course material and completing your assignments. Instructors and TAs understand that students might encounter connectivity issues or other problems that prevent them from participating in a particular synchronous class session on Zoom, and would not count something beyond your control against you.

* ## Can I change courses (add/drop) during the summer?

  Because Summer Session courses are brief and very intensive, we strongly encourage students to consider their choices very carefully before they apply. Course changes must be made before the second class meeting of a three-week course, and before the third class meeting for longer courses.

  Students will only be allowed to add/drop under very special circumstances once courses have begun. All changes must be approved by the Summer Session program staff at [summersession@uchicago.edu](mailto:%20summersession@uchicago.edu).

* ## What if the course I want to take is cancelled?

  Very occasionally, because of a significant conflict or because an insufficient number of students have enrolled in a class, a course is cancelled. Students who are registered in a cancelled class will be contacted by Summer Session and offered the opportunity to enroll in an alternative course or program. If a student does not wish to take another course in its place, the student's deposit will be returned. A course cancellation will be announced at least two weeks prior to the start of the course.

* ## Do I need a computer for a remote class?

  Remote students will need access to a computer and reliable wifi while in class.

* ## Are there remote classes on Juneteenth or July 4 (Independence Day)?

  Classes will not be held on either June 19 for Juneteenth or July 4, and University administrative offices will also be closed. Students should expect to be in class on the days surrounding the holiday unless an instructor says otherwise.

* ## Can I get my books before my remote classes start?

  In mid-May, students can see if their course requires a textbook by searching the Bookstore's and Seminary Co-op websites. Many courses have readings that are available entirely online via Canvas that requires a cNet ID and password.

* ## Are Summer Session remote courses for credit?

  All remote courses open to high school students are graded (A-F), carry at least 100 units of credit, and have undergraduate-level course numbers. It's important to note that the University of Chicago operates on a quarter system. Each University of Chicago 100-unit course is the equivalent of 3.3 semester credit hours.

  + Summer Online: 100 UChicago units = 5 quarter hours = 3.3 semester hours
  + Pre-College Summer Language Institute: 300 UChicago units = 15 quarter hours = 10 semester hours

* ## How do I order or view my transcript?

  To order transcripts, please log in to your [myUChicago](https://my.uchicago.edu/) to view and request a transcript from the [Registrar's Office](https://registrar.uchicago.edu/). The Summer Session Office cannot issue transcripts; only the Registrar's Office can act in this capacity.

  On your my.uchicago account, you should be able to request an official transcript by following these directions:  
  Students should select Academics (on the top left of the page) --> Academic Records --> Request Official Transcript

  If you do not have access to your CNET ID, you can request transcript through Parchment here: <https://registrar.uchicago.edu/records/transcripts/>

* ## How do I transfer credit from Summer Session courses to another university?

  Students interested in transferring UChicago credit earned during Summer Session should contact the university where you would want the credit to be applied about their requirements for doing so. Transfer of credit is at the discretion of the recipient university. You will be able to request your transcript via your MyUChicago account after the summer quarter ends in late August.

* ## If I take a UChicago Summer Session course for credit and eventually attend UChicago as an undergraduate, do those credits count towards my graduation requirements?

  Unfortunately, these courses do not count toward graduation requirements. During the summer immediately prior to matriculation, incoming students are permitted to take University of Chicago courses. These will confer College credit. Interested students should see [this page](https://college.uchicago.edu/summer-session/summer-session-faqs) for more information.

## Remote Learning

* ## What platform(s) will be used to deliver Summer Session remote courses?

  + **Canvas** is the official LMS (learning management system) already in use for instructors across campus to manage individual courses. Canvas provides access to the course syllabus, links to online resources, assignments, discussion boards, and other essential teaching tools.
  + **Zoom** (Enterprise) is the official video conferencing platform, which allows for real-time interactions among instructors, teaching assistants, and students. All instructor-led class sessions on Zoom will be recorded, so that a student who misses the session may view it later on their own schedule. Students may also use Zoom to engage with each other on assignments and group projects.
  + Other online tools such as Microsoft Teams and Google's G-Suite may be used by instructors depending on the course's specific curricular needs, but all will be required to fulfill the privacy requirements articulated at [studentprivacypledge.org](https://studentprivacypledge.org/).

* ## What training have instructors had that will help them successfully conduct their courses online?

  Offices across the University have worked hard to make sure that instructors have training and support related to both the technological and pedagogical elements of translating an in-person course to an online environment. That work includes:

  + The University launched a [Teaching Remotely](https://teachingremotely.uchicago.edu/) website with resources for instructors and TAs that is updated almost daily with a variety of useful resources.
  + Academic Technology Services, the [Center for Teaching](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/resources/foundations-of-teaching-learning/pedagogical-guidance-for-remote-teaching/), and individual academic divisions and departments have created online trainings for instructional staff on the use of Zoom, Canvas, Panopto; transitioning an in-person class to a remote instruction model; subject-area specific trainings on how to reach particular curricular goals effectively, such as teaching writing, running a virtual biology lab, leading online discussions, building online community, and many others. Summer Session staff have attended and contributed to many of these sessions, and will have additional workshops with instructors and TAs for Pre-College courses to address their particular pedagogical needs.

  This is not a comprehensive list, but we hope it gives you an idea of the seriousness with which we are approaching our obligation to provide students with an effective learning experience during Summer Session.

* ## How will we turn in assignments? How will quizzes, tests, and exams be given?

  You can upload various files—documents, videos, presentations, and more—to Canvas for submission and receive grades and feedback the same way. Quizzes and exams will also be taken on Canvas, and you can even upload handwritten work, like math scratch paper. Your instructor and TA will guide you through the process.

* ## I will be living outside the US while taking my course. Will I be able to access all required systems from where I am?

  All platforms that support Summer Session remote teaching are web- or cloud-based, and so can be accessed by anyone with a reliable internet connection. We recommend that students use the computer audio, rather than a separate call-in phone number, when joining real-time meetings. Separate call-in local numbers will be made available to individual students as needed on request.

* ## What is Summer Session doing to accommodate students who are in different time zones or who have other possible barriers to synchronous online classes like internet connectivity issues?

  Courses will combine synchronous and asynchronous instruction in order to maximize flexibility and accessibility of course content for students. Students are expected to attend all the synchronous classes. Some real-time sessions will be recorded so that if a student misses the session for any reason, they may watch the recording and catch up right away. Other class meetings such as discussion sections with TAs or office hours with instructors will be scheduled at times that work for students. Group projects may be assigned to students living in the same or close time zones, to help coordinate work with local schedules.

* ## What online safety resources are available?

  As cited in the Policy Handbook in "Community Standards", UChicago Summer Session works to ensure that all students are supported throughout their academic experience. If an incident occurs where a Summer Session student experiences targeting or harassment, staff will document the incident and can intervene between students in multiple ways. If the behavior continues or the situation is not immediately resolved, the incident will be referred for a disciplinary response. Staff will follow up on any report of concerning or inappropriate online interactions.

* ## As a parent, may I listen in on or record my child's class?

  Only enrolled students are allowed to participate in class sessions. Parents are not allowed to listen in on or attend Summer Session classes, as this could disrupt the running of a class for the instructor or participants, and would violate the privacy of the students attending the course.

  To protect student privacy as well as the intellectual property rules governing course curricula, neither students nor parents are allowed to record class sessions. Students may view recordings of their classes within the course's Canvas site as intended by the instructor, but may not download or share any recordings.

  Parents who have questions or concerns about their child's academic experience should contact

## Online Community & Support

* ## Will there be a program orientation?

  Parents and students will be able to participate in virtual orientation sessions, to learn more about the support that Summer Session staff provides. Look for more information by email before the start of your class.

* ## In addition to the faculty members and teaching assistants who will support students academically, what other resources can Summer Session students access?

  In addition to in-class support staff and resources, Summer Session students can connect by email or Zoom with our residential student staff members who provide additional support and mentoring outside the virtual classroom.

* ## How can I connect with the Summer Session community?

  Outside of class time, Summer Session students can request to connect with our Summer Session residential staff for informal mentoring. The staff includes UChicago students and recent alumni who can connect over Zoom or email to share their experiences, advice, support and resources.
