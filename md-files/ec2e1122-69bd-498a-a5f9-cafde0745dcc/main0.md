Students from across the country will have the opportunity to apply for a variety of GRAMMY Camp programs. Led by a GRAMMY Camp faculty of music industry professionals and GRAMMY Nominees and Winners, GRAMMY Camp is the industry’s only summer camp dedicated to providing students with valuable insight from real-world music makers to give campers the best chance at achieving success in their chosen career.
