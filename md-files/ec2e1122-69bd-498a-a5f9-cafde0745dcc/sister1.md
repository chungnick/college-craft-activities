GRAMMY Camp Nashville is a seven-day, non-residential immersive music industry program designed for high school students who already have foundational skills and knowledge in music and are ready to expand their expertise toward career preparation. GRAMMY Camp Nashville offers instruction across multiple career tracks including Music Business, Instrumental Performance, Music Production, Songwriting, and Vocal Performance.
  
  
Through the process of creating media projects, recordings, and performances, participants build on their existing abilities while developing a deeper understanding of industry practices. Guided by GRAMMY-winning and -nominated professionals, Recording Academy members, industry experts, and guest artists, students engage in collaborative, hands-on learning experiences that emphasize creativity, problem-solving, and professional growth.

## Career Tracks

Music Production

Description:
  
Campers will receive comprehensive instruction on recording techniques, including mic technique, signal flow, and sonic shaping both in studio and live applications. Campers will also learn aspects of traditional music production through to music creation with digital instruments with learning methods of programming, editing, sampling, and mixing on digital audio workstations to help further develop their original compositions. Campers will learn innovative techniques in digital music production, remixing, and sound manipulation to combine performance, composition, and orchestration with computer, synthesis, and multimedia technology. Students should have at least a rudimentary understanding of recording equipment and be familiar with basic audio terminology (i.e., microphone, compression, reverb, etc.) and digital audio workstations (DAW).

Submission Requirements:
  
Submit one music and/or video selections as MP3s YouTube or SoundCloud links of projects you have recorded and/or mixed either in a recording or live performance setting.

You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.). Submit one example in MP3 format of music you have created using computer-based platforms (with or without the addition of live instruments). You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.).

Songwriting

Description:
  
Aspiring songwriters will sharpen the skills of their craft while exploring song structure, harmony, melody, lyric writing, and (where applicable) vocal technique. This track will also provide Campers with the opportunity to collaborate with a band, singers, and other songwriters. They will also gain valuable insight on sound business practices including effective marketing. This Career Track does not require you to be a singer. However, you should have a rudimentary understanding of music theory, and having some keyboard or guitar performance ability is highly recommended.

Submission Requirements:
  
Video of you or someone else singing two of your original compositions. If someone else is performing, you must make an on-camera introduction of each song and the performer(s).

All songs must be written solely by you. Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s). You are encouraged to submit lyric sheets with your songs and/or put the lyrics in the YouTube description.

Vocal Performance

Description:
  
The Vocal Performance track is primarily for singers who desire to pursue an artist path in the music industry and/or wish to work as professional vocalists in some capacity (session singer, background vocalist, etc.). Campers will spend their time learning about the many different aspects of a vocalist that must be developed to have a successful, sustainable career in the industry, taking the vocalist beyond simply singing well and diving deeply into other essential skills. These include caring for and protecting the voice, developing better relational skills for collaboration, overcoming performance anxiety, increasing business savvy, and identifying ways to up-level musicianship.

Submission Requirements:
  
Video of you singing two songs of differing styles and/or tempos in the following genres:

* Pop* Country* R&B* Rock* Soul* Hip hop* Gospel* Etc.

*NOTE: One jazz selection is fine but please do not submit musical theater or classical songs.*

Announce the title and artist who originally performed the song before you sing each song. Performance with live or recorded accompaniment is strongly recommended (a cappella performances are not advised). Important: we recommend that you do not use professional studio audio in your recording. Simply use the mic on your phone or whatever you are using to capture your video– we want to hear a raw (untuned and unprocessed) vocal as that tells us the most about your singing.

Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s). You are encouraged to submit lyric sheets with your songs and/or put the lyrics in the YouTube description.

If audio is recorded with a DAW (a digital audio workstation like Logic, Garageband, ProTools, etc.), no processing of pitch and/or time is acceptable. A bare minimum of effects (reverb, delay, compression, etc.) is strongly encouraged as well.

Music Business

Description:
  
There are many careers in music that make the success of an artist possible. This Career Track will explore the inner workings of the music business including marketing, management, touring, concert production, publicity, entertainment law, and entrepreneurship in this ever-changing industry. Students should have a passion for exploring the non-performance roles on an artist’s team and a basic knowledge of the current music industry.

Submission Requirements:
  
Please submit a brief (2-6 sentences) written response to each of the following:

* Pick an artist that you would like to work with. Describe what role you would like to play on their team (management, PR, marketing, live event production, legal, etc.) and how you would approach that position.
* Pick a person, a music company, and/or a website that you feel has had an impact on the music industry and explain how.
* Please upload answers to these two prompts. Video response submissions are also allowed, but answers should be prepared and recited (no rambling responses).

Instrumental Performance

Description:
  
Musicians will study, rehearse, and perform in multiple settings including live events and studio sessions while also learning practical paths to a successful career as a musician.

Submission Requirements:
  
Submit videos of you performing two musical styles chosen from the following:

* Rock
* Pop
* Jazz
* Latin
* R&B
* Blues

If audio is recorded with a DAW (a digital audio workstation like Logic, Garageband, ProTools, etc.), no processing of pitch and/or time is acceptable. A bare minimum of effects (reverb, delay, compression, etc.) is strongly encouraged as well.

Please do not submit recordings of school performances or video links from social media sites such as Instagram or TikTok.

**Rhythm Section: Drums, Bass, Guitar, Keyboard:** Please perform with a band, making sure you are clearly heard in the mix, or with recorded or programmed accompaniment. If you must perform unaccompanied, you must perform with a “click” (a metronome). Please demonstrate your abilities both “comping” (accompanying) and soloing.
  
  
*Drummers—please ensure the camera angle shows your entire body so we can see both of your hands and posture while playing.*

**Winds & Strings: Trumpet, Trombone, Saxophone, Violin, Viola, Cello, Other Brass, Woodwinds, and Strings:** Please perform with a band, making sure you are clearly heard in the mix, or with recorded or programmed accompaniment.
