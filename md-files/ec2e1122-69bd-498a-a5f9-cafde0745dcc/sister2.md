GRAMMY Camp Miami is a five-day, non-residential immersive, fast-paced program designed to give high school students a hands-on introduction to the music industry. Participants will explore core areas of the business—including songwriting, music production, music business, and performance—while working directly with industry professionals. Through interactive workshops, collaborative projects, and real-world scenarios, students gain practical skills, creative insight, and a deeper understanding of today’s music landscape.
  
  
GRAMMY Camp Miami emphasizes active participation and learning in one of the three tracks. Students will work in small groups to develop and present creative projects that are either track specific or collaborations with students from other tracks. Along the way, they’ll gain insights into industry trends, technology, and career pathways, while building confidence, collaboration skills, and artistic vision.

## Career Tracks

Music Production

Description:
  
Campers will receive comprehensive instruction on recording techniques, including mic technique, signal flow, and sonic shaping both in studio and live applications. Campers will also learn aspects of traditional music production through to music creation with digital instruments with learning methods of programming, editing, sampling, and mixing on digital audio workstations to help further develop their original compositions. Campers will learn innovative techniques in digital music production, remixing, and sound manipulation to combine performance, composition, and orchestration with computer, synthesis, and multimedia technology. Students should have at least a rudimentary understanding of recording equipment and be familiar with basic audio terminology (i.e., microphone, compression, reverb, etc.) and digital audio workstations (DAW).

Submission Requirements:
  
Submit one music and/or video selections as MP3s YouTube or SoundCloud links of projects you have recorded and/or mixed either in a recording or live performance setting.

You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.). Submit one example in MP3 format of music you have created using computer-based platforms (with or without the addition of live instruments). You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.).

Singer/Songwriter

Description:
  
Aspiring singer/songwriters will sharpen the skills of their craft while exploring song structure, harmony, melody, lyric writing, and (where applicable) vocal technique. This track will also provide Campers with the opportunity to collaborate with a band, singers, and other songwriters. They will also gain valuable insight on sound business practices including effective marketing. This Career Track does not require you to be a singer. However, you should have a rudimentary understanding of music theory, and having some keyboard or guitar performance abilities is highly recommended.

Submission Requirements:
  
Video of you or someone else singing two of your original compositions. If someone else is performing, you must make an on-camera introduction of each song and the performer(s).

All songs must be written solely by you. Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s). You are encouraged to submit lyric sheets with your songs and/or put the lyrics in the YouTube description.

Music Business

Description:
  
There are many careers in music that make the success of an artist possible. This Career Track will explore the inner workings of the music business including marketing, management, touring, concert production, publicity, entertainment law, and entrepreneurship in this ever-changing industry. Students should have a passion for exploring the non-performance roles on an artist’s team and a basic knowledge of the current music industry.

Submission Requirements:
  
Please submit a brief (2-6 sentences) written response to each of the following:

* Pick an artist that you would like to work with. Describe what role you would like to play on their team (management, PR, marketing, live event production, legal, etc.) and how you would approach that position.
* Pick a person, a music company, and/or a website that you feel has had an impact on the music industry and explain how.
* Please upload answers to these two prompts. Video response submissions are also allowed, but answers should be prepared and recited (no rambling responses).

## Faculty

Greg “Stryke” Chin – Music Production

Stryke was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and began playing classical piano at age four. After moving to Miami at 10, he discovered electronic music, blending his love for Beethoven and Chopin with a new passion for groups like Depeche Mode and New Order. By 12, he was writing songs on his first synthesizer, and by 14, he was DJing to support his growing studio setup. Stryke’s sound spans house, techno, and ambient, though he resists genre labels, saying, “It’s all music. All that should matter is whether it’s personally enjoyable.”  
  
Known for his immersive DJ sets, he’s toured globally and performed alongside Richie Hawtin, Josh Wink, and others—often using custom software and gear to blur the line between DJing and live performance. His projects and collaborations include Murk, Christian Smith, John Beltran, and Oscar G, with chart-topping tracks like “Time” and remixes for artists such as Depeche Mode, Pink, and Nic Fanciulli. He’s released music on top labels including Tronic, Ovum, Plastic City, Saved, and Nervous.  
  
Stryke has served as President and Trustee of the Recording Academy’s Florida Chapter and is a longtime GRAMMY Camp faculty member, where he developed the Electronic Music curriculum. He also contributed to USC’s Electronic Music Production degree and currently works as Director of Product Management at Avid, makers of Pro Tools.

Drea Tomé – Singer/Songwriter

Drea is a Miami-born singer-songwriter who writes to connect—with herself, and with others. Her songs are honest, story-driven reflections of what it means to feel deeply, love bravely, and live through change.  
  
She found her voice young, using music as a way to connect and make sense of the world around her. Since then, songwriting has become her most authentic form of expression—one that’s opened doors while always bringing her back to the heart of why she began: to share her stories through lyrics and melodies. Her debut EP Echoes charted on three iTunes charts, leading to collaborations with artists and songwriters across genres. In 2021, she earned her first Latin Grammy for co-writing “Cuando Hay Amor” on Gloria Estefan’s #Brazil305, receiving coverage from Billboard, iHeart, Yahoo, and People en Español.   
  
Now signed with Universal Music Publishing Group, Drea writes weekly with artists and producers around the world, and is quietly working on her next project, an intimate and honest collection of songs coming later this year. Whether she’s writing for herself or someone else, Drea’s mission remains the same: to share stories, to make people feel seen, and connect through music.

Guillermo Page – Music Business

Guillermo J. Page is a seasoned music industry executive, consultant, and educator with decades of international experience working with major labels, startups, and academic institutions. He currently serves as an Associate Professor and Assistant Director of the Music Industry Program at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, one of the top programs of its kind. At Frost, he teaches courses on music industry fundamentals, marketing, record label operations, and advanced industry analysis.  
  
Page’s career includes senior leadership positions at Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, and BMG Entertainment, where he grew market share, developed commercial and digital divisions, and generated new revenue streams through licensing and brand partnerships. He also founded Vedisco Records, a successful Latin indie label based in the U.S. during the 90s, and now leads GDR Consulting, advising artists, labels, and publishers on rights, strategy, and market growth.  
  
A recipient of the Frost’s Centennial Medal, Page holds a BBA and MBA from the University of Miami and an MS in Marketing from Florida International University. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Music & Entertainment Industry Educators Association (MEIEA) and partners with the GRAMMY Museum on its annual GRAMMY Camp program. He is fluent in both English and Spanish.
