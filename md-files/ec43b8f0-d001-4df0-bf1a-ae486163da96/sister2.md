## Fees

By University policy, summer fees are based on the fees charged in the subsequent academic year.

The following outlines a few common student statuses. Please contact Summer Session if you have specific questions about your student status.

\*Please note that the full-time fee incentive program does not apply to visiting non-UC students, to special programs charging a program fee in lieu of course fees, and any courses with other applicable discounts (such as independent study courses). Fees other than course fees will be charged according to the appropriate deadlines and policies for enrollments beyond 8 units. Course fees are pending final approval by the Regents of the University of California and may be adjusted at any time for all campuses, including UC Irvine.
