## Hear from Past Participants

### Sehaj Sethi

"I truly enjoyed working and creating a project with my peers. The reiterations and feedback truly helped me as a person to become a much better coder and problem solver in my environment. I hope to take these skills in my future path as a data scientist."

### Nathaniel Mbatha

"This is my favorite session – making a filtering app for Instagram – because it extends the creativity. And we’re able to make our own designs. One thing that surprised me is that in making an app, there are so many different parts that I had no idea about. It has opened my mind to see there are so many things that I can learn about for software development."

### Waqas Islam

“It’s good to break into these subjects like AI, data analytics. These are really hard things, but I was able to benefit from these classes.”

### Sophie Alguilera

"I really like how the teachers are able to explain things thoroughly and that there’s many college students that come and help you out as well."

### Kenji Schroeder

“I think coming here is really useful if you need to get a taste of the college experience, which is very different from the high school experience."
