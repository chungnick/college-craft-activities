# FPE Summer Camp

The **Fire Protection Engineering Design Challenge (FPEDC)** camp is a week-long design and construction camp that ends in a team competition. In teams of 3 or 4, participants will design, test and build a two-room apartment along with the notification, detection and suppression systems in that apartment. The teams will bring their apartments to be fire-tested in a competition at the end of the week in the University of Maryland fire labs.  
  
The summer camp is housed at 4403 Frederick Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21229, at Mount St. Joseph's Catholic High School. Though the camp is offered at an all-boys school, this summer program is open to all who are interested to attend! The SFPE (Society of Fire Protection Engineers) Chesapeake Chapter and Mount St. Joseph's school will collaborate to provide the teaching for the camp. The final 'Burn Day' competition will be staffed by current FPE students, staff and faculty.
