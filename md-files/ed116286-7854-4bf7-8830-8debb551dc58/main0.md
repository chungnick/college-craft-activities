Intern Duties & Responsibilities

*A typical day as an intern:* 8:00am organizational meeting at the BFS Main Lab to coordinate daily activities, equipment and vehicle needs, etc. Daily activities depend on the research needs of faculty, staff and interns. Some days students will work on their own projects, other days they will be helping faculty/other interns who need additional assistance. Over the course of the summer all will experience a mix of field work (fisheries surveys, plant surveys, water sampling, etc.), laboratory analyses (e.g. water chemistry, zooplankton ID, fish dissection), data analysis, writing, and many other things. If samples were collected in the field, they must be processed or prepared for storage upon return to the lab. The day generally ends at 4:00pm.

A weekly seminar is held; day/time will be announced. The first few seminars will include presentations by BFS faculty and staff, covering topics related to the ecology of Otsego Lake and the hydrology of its watershed. Each intern will give a 10-20 minute presentation to the group detailing their research project(s).

Technical report(s) of research are due prior to the last day of SUNY Oneonta Summer Session (early Aug.). If work is still in progress, a plan for its completion must be approved by your faculty mentor and/or BFS staff prior to the first day of fall classes. Each intern will also produce a large-format poster to display their research project and findings. Examples of technical reports can be seen in the [BFS Annual Reports](/biology-department/biological-field-station/publications "BFS Publications").

Stipends for Summer Research

Upon successful completion of the internship and deliverables:

* High school interns receive: $3,500
* Undergraduate interns receive $5,000 plus complementary housing ($1,750 value), as needed

Successful candidates have a strong academic background in environmental or natural sciences. They must be self-motivated and willing to work effectively as team members under a variety of environmental conditions. Applicants should be prepared to present PowerPoint updates on their research over the summer, summarize their work in both a large-format poster and a detailed technical report of their research, to be included in the [BFS Annual Report](https://suny.oneonta.edu/biological-field-station/publications/annual-reports-2020-2029). These criteria will be considered in the evaluation of applicants.

Frequently Asked Questions

**HOUSING**: Undergraduate student interns are eligible to live in SUNY Oneonta campus dormitories; limited rustic bunk-style housing is also available on the Thayer Farm. In some cases, interns from out of town have made personal arrangements for housing with local landlords. Contact the BFS with inquiries.

High school students are not eligible for on-campus housing unless they have graduated and are enrolled in an undergraduate program in the fall following their internship. Contact the BFS with inquiries.

**TRANSPORTATION**: Weekdays, the BFS provides a shuttle which leaves from SUNY Oneonta campus promptly at 7:15 from the parking lot across from the MOC Service Building on Ravine Pkwy, arriving at BFS for the 8:00am meeting. The shuttle returns to the SUNY Oneonta campus at the end of the day (4:00pm). The field station is located about 45 minutes away from Oneonta.

**COSTS**: The Biological Field Station offers one semester hour of college credit for each intern that is accepted into our program. This one credit will be paid for by the BFS. An intern can opt to take up to three (3) semester hours worth of credit for the summer experience. Any additional credits above the one offered by BFS must be approved by the Director and must be paid for by the intern.

**DATES**: A college internship is 10 weeks long. A high school internship involves 8 weeks of participation. It is expected that each accepted intern stays the entire length of the internship. There is flexibility regarding when the internship begins and ends. Most interns have opted to start their internship within a week or two of the ending of their semester/school year. Each day begins with a group meeting promptly at 8am and concludes at 4pm each day. Certain projects may require occasional alternate hours (measuring stream discharge during storm events, 24-hour fish tracking, hydroacoustic surveys, etc.).

**PROJECTS**: Most projects undertaken by summer interns are related to the continued monitoring of Otsego Lake and the Susquehanna watershed that the BFS routinely carries out. You can read reports prepared by past summer interns on our website on the [publications page](/biology-department/biological-field-station/publications "BFS Publications"). Intern reports are published in our Annual Report each year. Independent projects are also allowed with approval from the Director. Availability of support faculty will factor into whether a project is accepted. Water quality and biota are major components of our work. One is intimately dependent upon the other. Often interns have an affinity for one above the other; this is a major consideration when choosing a project.
