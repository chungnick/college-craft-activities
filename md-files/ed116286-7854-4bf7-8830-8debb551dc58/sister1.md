Why is the TAP Grant/SUNY Tuition Credit not reflected on my billing summary?

If you do not see these funds reflected on your billing summary you will need to login to the [HESCPIN Authentication System](https://webapps.hesc.ny.gov/hescpin/main) with your HESC USER ID and PIN. If you don’t have a HESC account or this is the first year completing a HESC application, you must first [register with HESC](https://webapps.hesc.ny.gov/hescpin/gateway?ag=registrationActions&haction=prepareRegistration).

Where are my student loans on the billing summary and how do I accept my federal student loans?

Before your loans will appear on your billing summary you must first login to [myOneonta](https://my.oneonta.edu), select my Financial Aid, select Award Tab, select Accept Award Offer, and finally select the correct aid year. Here, you will accept (or reduce) your federal student loan(s).

If you are a new student borrower you will also need to complete two online loan steps to secure your loan(s) for disbursement. Please visit [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) and login using your student FSA ID. Select "I'm in School." Next, select the "Complete Loan Entrance Counseling" link. After this step has been successfully completed return to the main menu and select "Complete Student Loan Agreement (MPN)." After these steps have been completed, you will see your student loan(s) reflected on your billing summary within 1-2 business days.

When will the Excelsior Scholarship appear on my account?

Are there other loan options available for students?

Yes, you may explore Private Student Loan options. These loans are in the students name and require a credit-worthy co-signer. Oneonta does not have a preferred lender; we participate with all lenders. Research [Private Educational Loans](https://www.elmselect.com/link/query?schoolId=686) to find a variety of lenders that participate in this loan program. Oneonta is not allowed to make any recommendations regarding private loan lenders. Private Educational Loan applications are completed online at the lender’s website. Once the application is pre-approved the school is notified and will handle it from there.
