#### National & NYS Graduate Student Fellowships and Scholarships

**[Masters-in-Education Teacher Incentive Scholarship Program](https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/nys-masters-in-education-teacher-incentive-scholarship.html)** - provides students who (a) have achieved academic excellence in their undergraduate studies, (b) are pursuing a master’s degree program in education, and (c) agree to teach for five years in a classroom at a NYS public elementary or secondary school with a full tuition scholarship to a State University of New York (SUNY) or City University of New York (CUNY) college or university. [Teacher Incentive Scholarship Program Application](https://webapps.hesc.ny.gov/questionnaire/page.hesc?questionnaireId=56&versionNumber=1)

**[National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201)** - The NSF seeks to encourage research in science, mathematics and engineering in the United States and to reinforce its diversity. The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is a National Science Foundation initiative that supports promising individuals early in their graduate studies. It awards Fellowships to those who demonstrate strong potential for significant research contributions in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), or STEM education. Recipients receive three years of financial support within a five-year period to pursue a research-based master's or doctoral degree in these fields.

**[Soros Graduate Scholarship Program for New Americans](http://www.pdsoros.org) -** The Fellowships are grants for up to two years of graduate study in the United States. The recipients are chosen on a nationally competitive basis. Thirty Fellowships will be awarded each year. A *New American* is an individual who (1) is a resident alien, i.e., holds a Green Card; or, (2) has been naturalized as a US citizen, or (3) is the child of two parents who are both naturalized citizens. The Program is open to individuals who retain loyalty and a sense of commitment to their country of origin as well as to the United States but is intended to support individuals who will continue to regard the United States as their principal residence and focus of national identity. The applicant must either have a bachelor's degree or be in their final year of undergraduate study. Those who have a bachelor's degree may already be pursuing graduate study and may receive Fellowship support to continue that study. Individuals who are in the third, or subsequent, year of study in the same graduate program are not, however, eligible for this competition.

**[Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowships (applied science and engineering)](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/the-fellowship/about/) -** This merit-based fellowship consists of a cost-of-education allowance and a personal support stipend. It can be renewed for up to 5 years of graduate study. Eligible applicants for Hertz Fellowships must be students of the applied physical, biological and engineering sciences who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America. College seniors wishing to pursue the Ph.D. degree in any of the fields of particular interest to the Foundation, as well as graduate students already in the process of doing so, may apply.

**[SMART Scholarship](https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart)** - The Science, Mathematics And Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service Program has been established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to support undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program aims to increase the number of civilian scientists and engineers working at DoD laboratories.

**The Federal TEACH Grant** provides up to $4,000 a year to students who are planning on teaching in particular high-need fields. In order for a student to receive this grant, they must agree to complete a service obligation by teaching in one of these fields and at a school that serves low-income students. If the teaching obligation is not completed, then the grant will convert to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan with interest charged from the date the original grant was received.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [**Department of Education's TEACH Grant Fact Sheet**](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/teach). This will provide you with all the terms and conditions of the award.

**[Graduate Diversity Fellowship Program](/sites/default/files/SUNY-Oneonta-Graduate-Diversity-Fellowship-Program-Application_0.pdf)** - The Graduate Diversity Fellowship Program (GDFP) is designed to direct aid to graduate/professional students who have demonstrated academic achievement and overcome disadvantage or other impediment to success in higher education. Candidates will contribute to the diversity of the student body by demonstrating their commitment to facilitating and enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in their academic programs and activities.

## Ongoing Support for Your Success

Our commitment to scholarship support extends throughout your time at Oneonta.
