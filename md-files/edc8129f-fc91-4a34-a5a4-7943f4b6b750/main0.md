## Kick-start your science career at Roswell Park

Roswell Park is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in Upstate New York. As a free-standing cancer center, we offer a unique internship experience for high school students in the region through our **Su**mmer **R**esearch **E**xperience in **Can**cer **(SURE-CAN)** Program. The SURE-CAN program leverages the expertise and innovative research programs of our faculty and benefits from state-of-the-art technologies at our cancer center.

* As an intern in our **SURE-CAN** program, you will experience an immersive 6-week curriculum comprised of lectures, group discussions and hands-on ‘dry’ or ‘wet’ lab research.
* You will be introduced to the fundamentals of cancer sciences including: cancer biology, imaging, genomics and emerging technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) methods.
* You will be exposed to basic statistics, research ethics and rigor-reproducibility in cancer research.
* You will learn how mathematics, physics, and engineering are integrated with biology in cancer research and allow us to accelerate discoveries and improve outcomes in cancer patients.
* The core research experience will be complemented by seminars and professional development activities including methods of scientific communication and discussions on careers in cancer sciences.

The SURE-CAN program internship will culminate in a research symposium where the interns will make formal scientific poster presentations of their research rationale, goals, and findings.

This 6-week program will allow you to get a sneak peek into all the career opportunities in the health sciences including cancer research, engineering, information technology, medical imaging, and research administration.
