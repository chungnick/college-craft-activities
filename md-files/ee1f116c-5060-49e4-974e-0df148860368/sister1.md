# Frequently Asked Questions

### What WFU programs are housed in Building 60S?

**Concentration in Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Discovery**. Leveraging the strength of the Chemistry department’s research program, Wake Forest now offers a concentration in Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery. With the goal of identifying new therapeutic agents, faculty will engage students in an in-depth study of the connections between chemical structure and biological function. This concentration will attract students in health-related fields, biomedical sciences, and pharmacology. This offering provides a new avenue to earning an American Chemical Society certified B.S. degree.

**B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology** **(BMB).** Learn what makes life possible with this interdisciplinary degree offered jointly by the departments of Chemistry and Biology. Understanding growth, development, reproduction and genetics begins with the study of life at the molecular and cellular levels. With a highly-engaged, hands-on approach to learning, faculty and staff will use analytical and quantitative methods in the chemical and physical sciences to learn practical skills for addressing today’s complex, biological, biochemical, and biomedical challenges. Students will partner with faculty mentors for at least two semesters and/or summers of research, culminating in a senior research project. Abundant undergraduate research opportunities are available in WFU labs and labs in the Innovation Quarter.

**B.S. in Engineering**. This Bachelor of Science program offers comprehensive and fully-immersed technical training with a firm academic grounding in liberal arts. With Wake Forest’s unsurpassed student-faculty engagement and real-world learning opportunities, the curriculum extends beyond that of a typical undergraduate engineering program. Classes began Fall 2017.
