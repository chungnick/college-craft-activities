### The Game

VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back is played on a 12’ x 12’ square field configured as seen above. Two (2) Alliances – one (1) “red” and one (1) “blue” – composed of two (2) Teams each, compete in matches consisting of a fifteen (15) second Autonomous Period, followed by a one minute and forty-five second (1:45) Driver Controlled Period.

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring **Blocks** in **Goals**, Controlling zones within Goals, and **Parking** in defined zones at the end of the Match.

SCoring

10 points

Each Block Scored

3 points

### Details

There are eighty-eight (88) **Blocks** on a V5RC Push Back Field.

There are four (4) **Goals** located around the field. Two (2) **Long Goals**, and two (2) **Center Goals**. There are also two (2) **Park Zones**,one (1) per Alliance.

Each Block scored in a Goal is worth three (3) points. Alliances receive points for **Controlling zones** in Goals.

Alliances can receive additional points for **Parking** robots at the end of a Match.

The Alliance that scores more points in the Autonomous period is awarded with ten (10) bonus points, added to the final score at the end of the match. Each Alliance also has the opportunity to earn an **Autonomous Win Point** by completing assigned tasks. This additional Win Point can be earned by both Alliances, regardless of who wins the Autonomous Bonus.

## 2025-2026 Signature Event Updates

1. An Event Partner wanting to apply to host a Signature Event must have hosted events for at least 2 seasons prior to applying.
2. Signature Events must use the officially branded award banners for the Excellence Award and Tournament/Teamwork Champions Award.
3. When hanging field skirts the VEX Robotics logo/brand name can not be covered up on the competition fields.
4. VEX V5 Robotics Competition Signature Events may have regional capacity and max per organization restrictions lifted 8 weeks before the event if the event is not full (similar to the process already in place for VEX IQ Robotics Competition Signature Events).
5. Minimum pit size reduced to 8’x 8’ instead of 10’x10’.
6. Beginning in the 2025-2026 season, the REC Foundation will collect $10 instead of $5 per team registration on all Signature Events. This is to help offset travel costs for REC Foundation staff to support these larger events.

## 2025-2026 Signature Event Application Reminders

1. Existing Signature Events only need to complete the Final Application (due by March 31, 2025)
2. New Signature Event concepts will need to complete the Initial Proposal by January 31, 2025 and if approved, complete the Final Application by March 31, 2025.
