### Signature Events

## RECF Signature Events

REC Foundation Signature Events give students the opportunity to play at a unique tournament that provides a special team experience. Signature Events have a level of technical expertise, production value, and overall event quality that is above and beyond that of a standard tournament.

The mission of these events is to provide more opportunities for teams that may or may not typically attend Event Region Championships or the VEX Robotics World Championship to experience an event of that level. Signature Events that meet the necessary requirements can qualify teams directly to the VEX Robotics World Championship. These events rely on the dedication of Event Partners who provide these special experiences for teams.

#### The 2025-2026 Signature Event Application Season

The 2025-2026 Signature Event Application Season opens on November 1, 2025. If you currently host a Signature Event, or are considering hosting one for the first time, please check out the application instructions and new updates for the upcoming season.

## 2025-2026 Signature Event Updates

1. An Event Partner wanting to apply to host a Signature Event must have hosted events for at least 2 seasons prior to applying.
2. Signature Events must use the officially branded award banners for the Excellence Award and Tournament/Teamwork Champions Award.
3. When hanging field skirts the VEX Robotics logo/brand name can not be covered up on the competition fields.
4. VEX V5 Robotics Competition Signature Events may have regional capacity and max per organization restrictions lifted 8 weeks before the event if the event is not full (similar to the process already in place for VEX IQ Robotics Competition Signature Events).
5. Minimum pit size reduced to 8’x 8’ instead of 10’x10’.
6. Beginning in the 2025-2026 season, the REC Foundation will collect $10 instead of $5 per team registration on all Signature Events. This is to help offset travel costs for REC Foundation staff to support these larger events.

## 2025-2026 Signature Event Application Reminders

1. Existing Signature Events only need to complete the Final Application (due by March 31, 2025)
2. New Signature Event concepts will need to complete the Initial Proposal by January 31, 2025 and if approved, complete the Final Application by March 31, 2025.
