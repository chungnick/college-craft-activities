## Overview

The Summer Scholars Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University is a six-week internship focused on exposing students to cancer research.

2025 cohort of Winship Summer Scholars.

Ten to twelve students are each paired one-on-one with a Winship physician or lab-based researcher to conduct hands-on research in an active laboratory. In addition, students take part in field trips to locations such as Michael C. Carlos Museum and Emory Proton Therapy Center, engage in roundtable discussions with cancer survivors, and attend faculty-led lectures on cancer biology and career paths in oncology. Through these experiences, we aim to inspire students to pursue careers in cancer research.

All eligible students with an interest in cancer research are encouraged to apply. We welcome applications from students of all backgrounds, including those attending Title I high schools, prospective first-generation college students, and individuals from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields.

Thanks to a generous gift from Mrs. Lou Glenn, a long-time advocate for science education and cancer research, we are able to offer stipends of $2,400 to accepted students who complete the six-week program.

### What to Expect

The program will run for six weeks from June 8, 2026, through July 17, 2026, with a mandatory orientation day at the start of the program. You will be working a typical schedule (e.g. 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.) alongside your team at Winship to advance cancer research. You will be expected to be on site for the duration of the program. If you have a conflict that will prevent you from fulfilling this expectation, then you are not eligible to apply for the program.

Students will present their final projects at a symposium on the last day of the program and are encouraged to invite their families and teachers to attend.

* Work one-on-one with a Winship investigator who will mentor them through a research project.
* Attend lectures given by Winship oncologists and research faculty to gain a better understanding of the breadth of cancer research
* Create life-long friendships with like-minded peers
* Present your research to Winship doctors, researchers, and graduate students

### Application Process

**To be eligible for the program, students must be at least 16 years old by June 8, 2026, and must be rising or graduating high school seniors.** Applicants for the in-person program must be U.S. citizens or have U.S. Permanent Resident status. There will be no exceptions to these eligibility requirements for the in-person program. Other students please refer to the virtual-only option below.

* Lectures are held between 10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Mondays, Wednesdays and occasional Fridays during the six-week program. The lectures are not recorded or offered at any other times.
* Lecture topics cover cancer biology, clinical and laboratory research methods, and oncology careers.
* A Certificate of Attendance will be provided to students who attend at least 70% of the sessions
* To be eligible for the virtual-only option, students must be at least 16 years old by June 8, 2026, and must be rising or graduating high school seniors. Applicants for this option are not required to be U.S. citizens or have U.S. Permanent Resident status.
