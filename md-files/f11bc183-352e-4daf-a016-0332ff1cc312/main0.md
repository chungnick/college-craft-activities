The construction and testing of model bridges promotes the study and
application of fundamental principles physics and also helps high
school students develop "hands on" skills through bridge construction.
By participating in the Bridge Building Competition students get a
flavor of what it is to be an Engineer, designing structures to a
set of specifications and then seeing them perform their function.
They are also provided with an academically-oriented extracurricular
activity which is recognized school-wide.
