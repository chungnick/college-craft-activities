## What to do if you feel sick or have COVID-19 symptoms

COVID-19 symptoms range from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Possible symptoms include, but are not limited to:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * Fever or chills * Cough * Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing * Fatigue | * Muscle or body aches * Headache * New loss of taste or smell * Sore throat | * Congestion or runny nose * Nausea or vomiting * Diarrhea |

If you develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, consider strategies such as [masking](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html), [distancing yourself from others](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/physical-distancing.html), and [testing](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/testing.html) with a rapid antigen test (RA test) to protect yourself and others. 

Most cases of COVID-19 are mild, but you need to take symptoms seriously. You may use Tylenol or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for fever or body aches. If you develop worrisome new symptoms or your symptoms are getting worse, call your primary care provider. Students should call Student Health: 203-432-0312. After hours call Acute Care: 203-432-0123.

**Call 911 immediately if you develop:**

* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.
* New confusion or inability to arouse or stay awake.
* Bluish lips or face.
* Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone.

## Information about COVID-19 tests and testing procedures

Updated 9/25/24

The CDC has updated their [recommendations](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=3c1c45cef6e30c7df2a3f51a650cb10cfbde0811bfd54340e28c634cc39aa7d58f7e7c1d57c0aae1470b64b2fa2a4bea0a29c507213170c5acd2a8088d024195) for steps individuals should follow if they develop symptoms of **any respiratory infection**, including COVID. 

* Testing is identified as “a choice,” recognizing that many are not currently testing, and that other common viral infections (e.g. flu) do not have easily available tests. Still, COVID tests may provide valuable information that may influence your behavior.
* Covid-19 Rapid Antigen Tests are readily available to purchase at most pharmacies including the Yale University Pharmacy, 55 Lock St, New Haven, CT.
* Testing remains important especially if you are [at increased risk of more severe COVID](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=3c1c45cef6e30c7d50debfc7b5dcf75208e63e8b2911d3f23bf0d2ad45d15a680514c49bfe32e53f2055ccfea25aa5f9264e1680219167b3260749cb74945a65) (over age 50, immunocompromised, or with certain conditions) and are a candidate for anti-viral treatment with Paxlovid, if you have high risk individuals at home, or if you are a healthcare worker.
* Additional testing information for Yale Health Plan dependents, spouses and retirees covered by Aetna Medicare is on the [Yale Health website](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/topic/covid-19-testing-guidance).

## What to do if you test positive for COVID-19

## **General Instructions for Everyone**

Updated 1/2/2026

* If you test positive for COVID-19,**follow the** [**CDC’s guidance for preventing the spread of respiratory viruses when you are sick**](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html)**.\***
  + **Do not go to classes or work** until you have been fever-free for 24 hours without fever-lowering medications **AND** your symptoms are improving.  Staff are encouraged to use sick time.
  + This is the period where you are most contagious.
* Staying home is also important for respiratory viral infections **without** fever.
* Return to routine activities, but take **ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS** for 5 days to prevent the spread of infection to others: wear a well-fitting mask, take steps to improve airflow, maintain distance from others, and wash hands frequently.
* If fever returns or symptoms worsen, return to the stay-at-home phase.

**Health Care Workers (HCW) – Return to Work Guidance** *(Rev. 1/2/26)*

This special guidance applies to Health Care Workers (HCWs) and students in clinical settings. An **HCW** is defined as anyone working or learning in a clinical setting.

* **Symptomatic HCWs** should stay home and obtain testing for **COVID, Influenza (Flu), and RSV**.
* **Return-to-Work Timelines**: 
  + **COVID / Flu / RSV**: HCWs may return **5+ days** after initially testing positive or becoming symptomatic.\*
  + **Other Upper Respiratory Infections**: HCWs may return if the following criteria are met: \*
    - Fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication
    - Symptoms are either mild and improving or resolved
* **Masking Requirements**:  
  + HCWs must **continue masking until day 7** after returning to work.\*
  + A **negative test** for COVID, Flu, or RSV is **not required** before returning.  
      
    *\*Timelines provided are for those without compromised immune systems. Please see the* [*table for additional information*](https://campushealth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/HCW%20Covid%20Guidance.pdf)*.*

### **What to Do if You Feel Sick or Have Symptoms**

Monitor your symptoms. You may use Tylenol or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for fever or body aches. If you develop worrisome new symptoms or your symptoms are getting worse, call your primary care provider. Students should call Student Health: 203-432-0312. 

### **Call 911 Immediately if You Develop:**

* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.
* New confusion or inability to arouse or stay awake.
* Bluish lips or face.
* Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone.

### **Additional Information for Undergraduate Students Living On-campus**

* Isolate in your room at the onset of symptoms and wear a mask around others, including in your suite.
* You may leave isolation 24 hours after a fever resolves (if present) and when your symptoms are improving.

### **Meals/Dining**

* You should not eat in the dining hall while isolating or if you have symptoms.
* Go to your residential college dining hall during open hours. Ask to be connected with your dining hall manager, who will provide you with a to-go container and disposable cutlery. Make your selections, tap for your meal, and return to your room or suite to eat.  Remember to wear a mask.
* If you are unwell and unable to walk to the dining hall, please ask a friend to pick up a meal for you or contact your college office for assistance.
* You may also order [Smart Meals](https://hospitality.yale.edu/download-app-menus-mobile-ordering-more) (residential college dining hall meal-to-go) through the [Yale Dining app.](https://hospitality.yale.edu/download-app-menus-mobile-ordering-more)

## Guidance about academics and instruction for those who test positive

**Academics and Instruction - Students**

* Consult your course syllabus or contact your instructors for the make-up policy for illness and other excused absences.
* It is your choice whether or not you inform your instructor of your COVID status.
* Reach out to your dean to discuss any personal or academic concerns.
* It is your responsibility to inform those you consider close contacts.

**Academics and Instruction – Faculty and Instructors**

* Faculty and instructors are encouraged to be as accommodating as possible—to the extent pedagogically and practically feasible—with students who are required to miss class because they are experiencing cold symptoms or are in isolation.
* While faculty and instructors may make short-term individual arrangements for remote instruction for students who are isolating, they may not approve such arrangements for a period of more than two weeks.
* Longer term absences must be approved by the student’s dean or the dean’s designee. Deans or their designees have the agency to determine reasonable school- or unit-specific arrangements.
* If a student tests positive and discloses their status to the instructor, Instructors may **not**notify others in the classroom. They may discuss whether there is a need for classroom close contact notification with the student. The instructor may assist with that notification only with the student’s explicit consent.

## Guidance for people who are immunocompromised

Some people who are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) are more likely to get sick with COVID-19 or be sick for a longer period. People can be immunocompromised either because of a medical condition or because they receive immunosuppressive medications or treatments. You should discuss your individual circumstances with your clinician.  Students who wish to request a disability-related accommodation may reach out to [Student Accessibility Services](https://sas.yale.edu/) for more information. Faculty and staff may contact the[Office of Institutional Equity and Accessibility](https://oiea.yale.edu/).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides guidance for people who are [immunocompromised or have certain medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/risk-factors/weakened-immune-systems.html).

## Information for close contacts

Updated 3/18/24

Putting physical distance between yourself and others can help lower the risk of spreading a respiratory virus. There is no single number that defines a “safe” distance, since spread of viruses can depend on many factors. Generally, infectious droplets and particles build up closer to the person who is releasing them. The closer you are to someone who has a respiratory virus, the more likely you are to catch it. 

While the CDC language continues to evolve, we continue to suggest that if you test positive for COVID, you notify those whom you consider to be close contacts so they can take precautions, especially if they are at [increased risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/risk-factors/index.html).  

The CDC provides actions to take to [help protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html) from health risks caused by respiratory viruses. These are especially helpful when you or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering. 

* monitoring for symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, and headache, among others,
* [taking steps for cleaner air](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/air-quality.html),
* practice good personal [hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/hygiene.html), like covering your coughs and sneezes and washing your hands,
* wearing a [mask](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html), while sick or around others who are sick,
* increasing [physical distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/physical-distancing.html) from others, and/or
* [testing](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/testing.html) when you have symptoms of a respiratory virus or have been around others that have symptoms.

#### **Additional Information for Roommates of Undergraduate Students Living On-campus**

If you are an undergraduate student living on campus and you share a bedroom with a student who has symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19, you may choose to stay where you are, move to the common room, or stay with a friend for a few days.

If you chose to remain where you are, you should:

* wear a mask when around your roommate except while sleeping
* minimize the time that you spend in the bedroom
* create as much space between beds as possible

If you have exhausted all options, please **contact your residential college office** who may be able to arrange for you to use a medical suite or alternative accommodation in other rooms.

## Yale University vaccination policy

**Updated 8/25/25**

Vaccination has been the cornerstone of Yale’s public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a potent tool in protecting us from severe illness and decreasing the risk of viral transmission. The university therefore strongly encourages all students, faculty, staff, postdoctoral/postgraduate trainees, and visitors to receive all COVID-19 vaccinations that are [recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcovid%2Fvaccines%2Fstay-up-to-date.html%3FCDC_AAref_Val%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fstay-up-to-date.html&data=05%7C02%7Cmorgan.sullivan%40yale.edu%7Cc765f81bdf604ce3fb5308dde4185f1e%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C638917515499510400%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bVOAFDpv%2B%2BSqdnMnRO7AqMkHVQFrWS%2FGWmQ0dcqRxX0%3D&reserved=0) and for which they are eligible. 

COVID vaccination **is no longer required**for healthcare workers or health profession student **but is strongly recommended.**

Health profession students may be subject to vaccination requirements of other institutions associated with work in various clinical settings. 

Free COVID vaccination is available to all faculty, staff, and students through the Yale Flu and COVID Vaccine Program each fall. See the “How to get a COVID vaccine” section for guidance on how to obtain a vaccine outside of this timeframe.   

This policy is subject to change based upon changes in public health conditions and/or guidance.

## How to get a COVID vaccine

Yale’s Flu and COVID Vaccine Program provides the updated COVID-19 vaccine from September through January each year.

Outside of the Yale Vaccine Program, the COVID-19 vaccine is widely available through your health insurance, usually at no cost to you. 

* Yale Health members may seek vaccine at local pharmacies by presenting their Yale Health membership card.
* Between February and August, when the vaccine program is not active, Yale Health members may contact the [Immunization Department](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/department/immunization) or schedule directly through MyChart.
* Employees with Aetna insurance may seek vaccination through the [Aetna network](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=061cc1c5f560e3c3d4bdf00213a81b7ebe032b965fa2be292419c063dde70a98133805d66bcc07f78ad80378572d5ed8d50538a6183bef4c). To find a participating pharmacy, please visit the [Aetna website](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=d699dddc87864596915844ac9709f8c47cff82dcc49c5142fb2cba46178cfe4595562dbd942e7c00e4977ba5c354aff928b6f5521a582acb) and click “Find a Pharmacy” on the homepage in the “Find Care & Pricing” section.
* Those with other insurance should speak with their healthcare provider or search [vaccines.gov](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vaccines.gov%2Fsearch%2F&data=05%7C02%7Clisa.kimmel%40yale.edu%7C1082ca09d26f432c46d508dc1e92b098%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C638418862576430921%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=4hpC2NmUb6LAdZhkUbVSAKOv52HvU0EHCAYfpyjvip0%3D&reserved=0) to find a COVID vaccine.
* Regardless of Yale Health coverage, all students, staff, and faculty may receive a COVID or Flu vaccine from the Yale Health Immunization Department.

Staff are encouraged to use sick time if needed to recover from a vaccination.
