The Yale School of Music provides talented students with a rich musical education.

Thanks to a generous gift from Stephen and Denise Adams (YC ’59) in 2005, **all students admitted to the School** **receive a full tuition award and fellowship**, with the exception of those who have earned awards from other agencies. This page has information about obtaining federal loans for living expenses and fees, the various jobs available to students through student employment, and other grants for which students can apply. Please contact the Office of Student Services with any questions.

## Billing, Account Statements, and Refunds

[Yale Hub](https://yub.yale.edu)
Toggle

Yale University uses an electronic billing and payment system. You will be notified when your e-bill is ready through your Yale email account. You may also access your e-bill through Yale Hub. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor and review their monthly account statements.

Tuition and fees for the fall term are billed on or about July 1 and payment is due the first business day of August. Likewise, the spring term is billed on November 1 and payment is due the first business day of December. A late fee of $125 per month is assessed if the balance due is not paid in full by the due date. Late fees are assessed on the August, September, and October statements for the fall charges and December, January, and February for the spring term charges.

Financial aid (scholarship and loans) will appear on the account statements as anticipated credits, provided your signed financial aid form is received by the due date. It could be your financial aid is enough to cover your balance due and you will not have a payment due for the August due date. Financial aid is split evenly between the fall and spring term.

## 

## Refunds of Credit Balances

If your financial aid exceeds your balance due and a credit balance is created, you may request a refund of the credit balance to use for your living expenses. To request a refund of a credit balance, go to Yale Hub; select *Student Accounts* from the sidebar menu, then select *Refund Requests from Student Accounts.* You may receive the refund as a check or as an electronic funds transfer (EFT) via direct deposit. Direct deposit in a U.S. bank account is the fastest way to receive your refund; the refund will be processed within 48 hours.

*Note: if you request a check, there is a three-day waiting period before a check can be issued.*

Please be aware that even though you can request your refund at any point after your netID is activated, the refund will not be processed until the first day of orientation in the fall term, and the first day of classes in the spring term. Additionally, due to the high volume of transactions during the first week of classes, it may take a little longer to get your refund, possibly up to one week.
