### Program Overview

While different disciplines require different ways of conducting research, all disciplines require that one engage in research. To engage in research means to be responsive to and in conversation with others, their ideas, and their research methods. The different ways that we can engage and conduct research—and what we understand research to be—is the topic of study for our Research Development Institute. Come prepared to contribute your ideas and be willing to complicate your current views of research and the ways it can be conducted.

Over the course of two weeks you will engage with research on a topic of your choice, which means that when possible, we will focus on practical, applied work with primary and secondary sources. This program is not lab-based, but rather focuses on developing critical thinking skills and understanding diverse research methods.

Ideal for students who are new to research, this program will help you develop a deeper understanding of a specific academic interest or field of study, preparing you for the rigors of college-level research. Join us to cultivate your skills and passion for academic inquiry within a supportive and engaging environment.

### **Eligibility**

To be eligible to apply for the Research Development Institute, you should:

* Be a current high school student graduating in 2029, 2028, or 2027.
* Possess a strong interest and an eagerness to learn about the research process. No prior research experience required. Designed specifically for students new to research. For students with previous research experience, we recommend considering the [Advanced Inquiry Institute](/advanced-inquiry-institute "Advanced Inquiry Institute").

We are looking for mature, academically motivated individuals enrolled in challenging curriculum which may include honors, advanced placement, and International Baccalaureate courses, if offered by their high schools. Individuals who are collaborative, intellectually curious, and creative thinkers thrive in our program.

### Fees and Scholarships

The 2026 program fee for the Research Development Institute is $3,985 which includes all program activities, housing, and meals. Need-based scholarship assistance is available. Children of WashU employees and returning participants are eligible for a 10% discount. Visit [Fees & Scholarships](https://precollege.wustl.edu/fees-scholarships) to learn more about fees, need-based scholarships, and discounts.

### Grading and Evaluation

Our summer institutes are ideal for individuals who want to experience college-level curriculum without the pressure of a letter grade. Class sizes are small (typically between 15-20 participants) to ensure participants receive personalized feedback from instructors. These programs are designed for participants to ask questions, collaborate with peers, and consider new ideas.

Although summer institutes are noncredit, they are rigorous. Participants are evaluated based on attendance and engagement in class activities, completion of assignments, quality of work produced, as well as their ability to adhere to academic integrity standards and program policies. Noncredit programs do not issue a traditional letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). Instead, you will receive an "L" for successful completion/audit or a "Z" for unsuccessful completion/audit.

Because summer institutes are noncredit, no transferable credit is earned. At the end of the program, participants may request a transcript of noncredit course work. No certificates are issued for these programs.

Acceptance and participation in summer institute course work and activities does not imply or guarantee acceptance into a degree program at WashU. For questions about the undergraduate admission process, please contact [Undergraduate Admissions](https://admissions.wustl.edu/).

## Program Schedule

### Morning Session

Participants start their day with breakfast and their morning session which meets from 10:00am-12:00pm. Morning sessions are a combination of traditional undergraduate classroom activities such as lectures, small group work, and discussion all lead by our WashU instructors.

### Lunch Break

Participants have a break for lunch from 12:00-2:00pm. During this time, they can eat at any of the on campus dining options or return to the residence hall to prepare a meal. This time is also used for independent study at any of the 7 Danforth campus library branches open in the summer. We also offer optional help and academic skill building sessions over the lunch break.

### Afternoon Session

Afternoon session begins at 2:00pm. These sessions typically included more individual work and application of content learned in the morning sessions. Instructors lead all afternoon sessions, working with participants and providing support for projects and assignments. The session wraps up by 4:00pm.

### Evenings

Evenings are spent in optional enrichment activities and dinner. After dinner, community events provide the opportunity to reflect and relax at the end of a busy day.

### Weekend

The weekend is spent socializing with peers and exploring our vibrant city of St. Louis. Optional outings will be organized by our staff, and there will be opportunities for participants to explore on their own as well.

### Wondering about campus life?

Research Development Institute participants live on campus in one of our top-ranked, air-conditioned residence halls. We are housed on the South 40 residential area of campus which includes secure residential halls, basketball and volleyball courts, hammocks, picnic tables, and lots of space to relax and socialize.
