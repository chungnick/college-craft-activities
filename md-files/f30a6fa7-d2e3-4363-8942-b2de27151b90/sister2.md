### Camp Overview

Automate Your Imagination (AYI) is a one-week, hands-on, summer camp for high school
students to introduce them to the basics of electrical engineering, industrial automation,
and mechatronics systems. Mechatronics is a synergic integration of electrical, mechanical,
electronics and computer science. The students will have an opportunity to learn and
practice LabVIEW graphical programming, sensor and actuator interfacing, and the concept
of industrial automation. The final project will allow the students to apply the mechatronics
concepts learned during the camp. Sample projects are obstacle avoidance robots, traffic
light control, ammunition loader, bottle processing plants, and pneumatic systems.
This unique summer camp is perfect for high school students considering a career in
engineering and engineering technology, as it combines college-level introductory
courses with hands-on activities.

|  | Lectures | Hands-on Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Introduction to electrical engineering technology, introduction to graphical programming | Hands-on activities on basic electrical circuits, soldering practice, first LabVIEW program |
| Tuesday | LabVIEW structures and data flow | LabVIEW programming practice |
| Wednesday | State machines, sensor and actuator interface | Hands-on activities for sensor interface |
| Thursday | Project briefing and LabVIEW programming | Project work: (obstacle avoidance robot, traffic light control, processing plant) |
| Friday | Project work | Project work final demo |
