## **Summer 2026 Course List**

In **Dive Into Oceanography**, students will embark on an advanced exploration of the field, beginning with the achievements of early ocean explorers whose discoveries shaped modern mapping, seafloor science, and the first studies of marine organisms. Building on this foundation, students will examine case studies of contemporary expeditions and analyze the diverse career pathways within oceanography. Each subsequent session will provide an in-depth study of one of the four core disciplines—geological, chemical, physical, and biological oceanography—through rigorous, inquiry-driven experiments and demonstrations. From investigating seafloor geology and seawater chemistry to applying mathematical principles of ocean physics and analyzing complex marine ecosystems, students will engage with the ocean at a professional level, encountering phenomena as intricate as plankton migrations, the mechanics of flying squids, and the sophisticated behaviors of whales.

---

This **Physics** course offers an in-depth exploration of the fundamental principles that govern the physical universe, combining conceptual understanding with quantitative analysis. Students will engage with the core domains of physics, including classical mechanics, thermodynamics, waves and oscillations, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity. The curriculum emphasizes not only mastering theoretical frameworks but also applying them to practical problems through mathematical modeling and experimental investigation.

Students will develop critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills by designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, and drawing evidence-based conclusions. The course encourages an inquiry-based approach, fostering curiosity about the natural world and the ability to connect abstract concepts to real-world phenomena. Applications will span from the microscopic scale of subatomic particles to the cosmic scale of astrophysics, illustrating the universality of physical laws.

By the end of the course, students will possess a robust conceptual foundation in physics, strengthened problem-solving abilities, and an appreciation for the role of physics in technological innovation, engineering, and scientific discovery. This course is designed to prepare students for advanced study in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and to cultivate a lifelong curiosity about the workings of the universe.
