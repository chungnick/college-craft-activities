## Frequently Asked Youth Program Questions

### [Does UTA’s Youth Program Policy apply only to youth programs held during the summer months (i.e., June, July and August)?](javascript:void(0);)

No. The Youth Program Policy applies to all youth programs 12 months of the year.

### [Can an external group hold a youth program on UTA’s campus? If so, what policy must be followed?](javascript:void(0);)

An external group can only have a youth program on UTA’s campus if they are sponsored by an appropriate UTA department.

A UTA sponsored external group is required to follow the University’s Youth Protection Policy and must complete a Request to Host in the Youth Software System, etc.

Please contact the Youth Program Compliance Coordinator at [youthprograms@uta.edu](mailto:youthprograms@uta.edu) for assistance.

### [Are youth program directors required to use Youth Software System (UTA’s Youth Program Management Software) for the Request to Host and participant registrations?](javascript:void(0);)

Yes, the use of the Youth Software System is required. The Request to Host is approved electronically by the appropriate University officials within the Youth Software System. Parents also register their child through Youth Software System and complete all required University forms before payment can be processed.

### [I am a UTA employee and I want to host a youth program. What do I need to do?](javascript:void(0);)

A UTA sponsored youth program where UTA takes care, custody and control of the minor are required to follow UTA’s Youth Program Policy in its entirety. A fully completed and approved Request to Host is required and participant’s must register for the Youth Program via the Youth Software System. All youth program workers/volunteers must submit to a CBC on an annual basis based on UTA’s academic year and complete the UTS Child Protection Training. Insurance for the youth program is also required.

In some instances (e.g., a sports camp) a parent can be in attendance as a spectator and UTA still takes care, custody and control of the minor. This qualified as a youth program and the youth protection policy must be followed.

### [I want to sponsor a youth program but UTA will NOT take care, custody and control of the minor. What do I need to do?](javascript:void(0);)

If UTA does not take care, custody and control of the minor, and is not the custodial responsibility of said minor, this does not fall under the category of a youth program. In which case, the Program Director is NOT required to follow the Youth Program Policy.

### [When is the Request to Host due for summer camps? What about youth programs during the fall and spring semesters?](javascript:void(0);)

The Request to Host is due no later than January 31 of each year for summer programs. The Request to Host for youth programs held during the months of September through May are due 12 weeks before the start of the program.

### [We have been asked if we can rent space in the MAC or College Park Center for a youth basketball tournament. Is that considered a youth program?](javascript:void(0);)

A tournament involving youth where the athletes are brought by their coach and remain with their coach throughout the event is not considered a youth program. These tournaments would generally be open to the public. A Request to Host is not required for this event. This is a facilities rental and would need to comply with all aspects of a facilities use agreement and any additional policies applicable to that.

### [Is a field trip to UTA considered a youth program?](javascript:void(0);)

The UTA Youth Protection Policy is not required to be followed in this case and a Request to Host is not required. **The building staff from the building where the field trip will be held are required to complete an annual CBC and the UTS Child Protection Training.**

### [Are activities sponsored by student organizations that involve youth required to follow the youth protection policy?](javascript:void(0);)

Compliance with UTA’s youth protection policy depends on whether UTA takes care, custody and control of the minor. In these instances, the program sponsor should contact the Youth Program Coordinator for guidance. A Request to Host is required – the level of completion will depend on the event details.
