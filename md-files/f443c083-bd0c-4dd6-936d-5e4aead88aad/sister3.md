## Eligibility

### I turn 16 a few days/weeks after the start of the program. Can I still participate?

No. You must turn 16 before the start of the summer research experience to participate in EYES, researcHStart or ACS Cancer Research Internship. Please refer to the applicant information packet for a specific date.

If you are in high school but not yet 16, consider applying for our Summer Healthcare Experience in Oncology program.

### Do I have to be a Chicago Public School student to apply?

No.

### Do I have to be a Chicago/Illinois resident to apply?

Residency requirements are listed on each program’s webpage under “Eligibility”. All applicants must be prepared to secure their own housing and transportation for the duration of the program.

### I participated in a UCCCC program once before. Am I eligible to apply again?

You may not participate in the same program more than once. However, you may apply for a different UCCCC program if you meet the eligibility requirements. You may also let us know that you’re looking for a summer research experience. We are always eager to help alumni find new training opportunities!

### Is there a minimum GPA requirement?

Applicants to the ACS Cancer Research Internship must have at least a 3.0 GPA. There is no minimum GPA requirement for other UCCCC programs.

### Is prior research experience required to apply?

No. Summer Healthcare Experience in Oncology, researcHStart and Chicago EYES on Cancer are introductory programs with substantial training and instruction to help you engage in research. The ACS Cancer Research Internship is slightly more advanced, so having some previous research experience may be beneficial.

### I am not eligible for any UCCCC programs this year and I want to find a summer research opportunity. Do you have any suggestions?

## Applications

### I am eligible for multiple UCCCC programs. Can I apply to more than one?

Yes. In fact, we strongly encourage it!

### What qualities do you look for in an applicant?

For high school and college students, we prioritize applicants with a strong interest in science and the interpersonal skills required for a professional work environment. Those admitted to the program demonstrate careful consideration of how the program will help them achieve their education and career goals.

### Do you accept late applications?

No.

### Does my transcript have to be official? (ACS Cancer Research Internship and researcHStart only)

No. However, please make sure that your name and the name of your school are clearly visible on the document. It should include courses and grades from the beginning of your freshman year.

### I won’t have my fall semester grades until AFTER the application deadline. What should I do? (ACS Cancer Research Internship and researcHStart only)

Submit your most recent transcript with the application. You can send updated grades to [cancertraining@bsd.uchicago.edu](mailto:cancertraining@bsd.uchicago.edu)when they become available, and we will add them to your file.

### Who should I choose as recommenders?

Consider individuals who can speak compellingly about your interests, skills, and qualities that make you a strong fit for the program. At least one recommender must be a teacher/professor. Other possibilities include a school counselor, coach, employer, or community leader. Please do NOT ask a close relative (e.g., parent, sibling, aunt).

### Can I submit more than the requested number of recommendations?

No. Recommendations submitted beyond the requested number will be discarded.

### I am not available on the scheduled interview day. Can I still apply for the program?

Yes. You can request alternative arrangements after you’ve received the interview invitation.

### When and how will I be notified whether I’ve been accepted to the program?

You will receive an email 4-6 weeks after applications close if you are selected for an interview. All applicants will be notified of final admissions decisions via email by the date indicated on each program website.

## Program Logistics

### Is housing provided?

No. You must provide your own housing and transportation to participate in our programs.

### What are the typical hours for on-campus summer research? (EYES, researcHStart and ACS Cancer Research Internship only)

Summer research experiences are fully in person. You should expect to be on campus from approximately 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday. The exact schedule will depend on your assigned research group.

### Will I get to choose what type of research I do this summer?

Program leadership makes research placements based on several factors, including your expressed interest in a particular type of cancer or research methodology. Potential areas of research are described in the application information packets.

### My school year ends after the start of the summer program. Can I still participate?

If the overlap is a matter of days, we will likely be able to accommodate you. Please disclose the scheduling conflict in your application or admissions interview so we can explore solutions. An overlap of a week or more between your academic schedule and the program schedule cannot be accommodated.

### I have a trip/event/other obligation planned during the summer research program. Can I miss a week?

No. Daily attendance at your research placement and participation in all program activities is required. You may miss up to two days for exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness, emergency, unavoidable school or family conflict). Additional absences will result in deductions to your award and possible expulsion from the program.

### Can I participate in multiple summer programs simultaneously?

No. Each of our programs require a full-time commitment.

### Can I take summer school classes while participating in EYES, researcHStart or ACS Cancer Research Internship?

Not without prior approval from program leadership. In general, only asynchronous summer courses that can be completed outside of program hours are permissible.

### I am an undergraduate student attending school outside of Chicago. Will I still be able to participate in the required academic year activities? (EYES and ACS Cancer Research Internship only)

Yes. All academic year activities can be modified for out-of-state students.

### I do not have a computer or laptop. Can I still participate in a UCCCC program?

Yes. Please communicate with us as early as possible if you will have trouble accessing the resources you need to fully participate in one of our programs. We will work with you to meet your needs.
