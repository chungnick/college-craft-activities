## What Students Say About Us

"The BEAM Program was an experience like no other. From building my own start-up with the help of UC Irvine's ANTrepreneur Center to gaining key engineering principles from Dr. Reinkensmeyer's lab, I was able to gain a vast amount of knowledge that not only spurred my passion for research but also thoroughly prepared me for a career in the STEM field. It was exciting to learn amongst peers bound by a similar interest in science and to bond with them through exciting group activities. I always felt comfortable asking questions and reaching out to a mentor when I needed help. I can certainly say this program was not only an important learning experience but also a chance to meet new people and build connections."

Sophia L. / Cornell University '25

"I am so grateful for the mentors, curriculum, and peers I had access to through the program. I owe my newfound interest in entrepreneurship and furthered pursuit of neuroscience research to BEAM. In fact, through my experiences in Dr. Yama Akbari’s lab, I decided to apply to colleges as a neuroscience major and am currently presumed to enter MIT next fall as a Brain and Cognitive Science major. In my estimation, BEAM successfully prepares students for college and even further life.  
  
Furthermore, despite the online platform, I felt little was taken from the program because of the passion the organizers had for delivering a holistic experience to me and my peers. I’m confident that this dedication will only improve the impact of BEAM in the coming years."

#### Beyond the Classroom Academics

A comprehensive talent search and enrichment program in California, UCI x GATI Programs help motivated high school students explore academic research and future career paths. Gifted students need more attention from parents, teachers, and experts for fostering their talents and connecting their promising brilliance to acclaimed academic programs.

​

GATI interviews every qualified applicant using the [ACT® Holistic Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCFglzNStII&ab_channel=ACT)™. Beyond core academic skills in English Language Arts (“ELA”) and Mathematics, we also discover and develop students’ cross-cutting capabilities, behavioral skills, and career navigation proficiency.

“What do you want to be when you grow up?”

You’ve probably been asked this many times. Whether you have a goal or are still searching, shouldn’t what you learn in school have relevance to your answer? UCIxGATI Programs help connect the dots between what you studied in your class to what you can become in the future.

“Raise the child you have, not the child you want.”

Beyond your child’s core academic skills, you probably know more than anyone else about your child’s potential. Every child possesses unique gifts and talents. UCIxGATI Programs specialize in discovering, developing, and disseminating students’ latent gifts and talents.
