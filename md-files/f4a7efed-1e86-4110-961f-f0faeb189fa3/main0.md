## Experience

Academic Life

You will participate in one course during your time in Oxford: *Basics in Biotech: From Genes to Innovation.*

Biotechnology is one of the most exciting and fast-moving fields in modern science. It sits at the intersection of biology and technology, transforming discoveries into advances that shape health and medicine. The goal of this course is to introduce you to the fundamentals of biotechnology and show you how scientific discovery turns into real-world impact.

The course combines foundational science with hands-on exploration of cutting-edge biotech innovations. You will begin with the building blocks of biology (e.g., DNA, proteins and cells) and learn how scientists use them to design new tools and treatments. From there, you’ll dive into today’s biotech frontier, including CRISPR gene editing (how researchers can “rewrite” DNA), cancer immunotherapy (training the immune system to fight disease), artificial intelligence and machine learning (how scientists use AI/ML to discover new medicines) and brain–computer interfaces (linking biology and technology in unexpected ways).

Classes will be interactive and discussion-based, while site visits will connect classroom learning to real-world research and innovation. By the end of the course, you will be able to explain core concepts in biotechnology and analyze how tools such as CRISPR and AI/ML drive innovation. This course will give you both a strong scientific foundation and an insider’s view of how breakthroughs emerge from research and grow into new technologies, therapies and companies.

Residential and Student Life

* You will reside on the St. Edmund’s campus, located in the historic city of Oxford in shared rooms and shared bathrooms.
* The On-Site Director, On-Site Coordinator and Student Life Managers reside in the residence hall with students, providing an atmosphere that supports your success by emphasizing community building and individual responsibility.
* You’ll have most meals in the St. Edmund’s dining hall. A few meals will be at local eateries in Oxford and London.
* You will engage in community building and cultural events and activities.
* Please note that you will have one or two hours of free time dispersed throughout each day at BEE, but the free time is not always predictable and does not occur at the same time each day. Additional coursework, including online courses for Brown or other programs, is not feasible.

Site Visits

*Site visits bring your classroom learning to life as you trace the path of discovery from Oxford’s scientific history to modern research and clinical impact. (Sample schedule; sites may change)*
