## Program Overview

The **Youth Science Fellowship Program (YSFP)**, hosted by the UC Irvine Cancer Research Institute, is a six-week summer program designed to expand access to hands-on scientific learning for high school students across Orange County. The program provides early exposure to cancer research through mentored experiences in basic or population sciences, where students work alongside UCI researchers in laboratory and research-team settings. Fellows also participate in interactive scientific seminars and professional development workshops.

Students participate **30 hours per week** during the program, generally between the hours of **8:00 AM and 6:00 PM**, Monday through Friday, depending on their lab’s schedule.

Fellows are paired with UCI research mentors to gain foundational laboratory and research skills, build confidence in scientific inquiry and communication, and explore future pathways in biomedical and cancer research. The program concludes with a **Scientific Poster Symposium**, where fellows present their work to faculty, peers, and family, celebrating their learning, growth, and accomplishments.

Individuals interested in science are strongly encouraged to apply.
