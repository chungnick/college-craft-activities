## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Program & Eligibility Information

Is there a fee for the program?
*Expand*

No — thanks to generous sponsorship, the program is free for accepted students.

Which grade level must I be in to apply?
*Expand*

At the time of the application deadline, you must be a high school junior (11th grade) or senior (12th grade) enrolled in an eligible Orange County high school. Sophomores (even if they will enter junior year) are not eligible due to liability and minor supervision requirements.

Do I have to be enrolled in an Orange County high school?
*Expand*

Yes — to apply, you must attend a high school located in Orange County. Residency alone is not sufficient; the school must be in the approved list. A full list can be found [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_schools_in_Orange_County,_California)

Can I participate if I have summer school or other commitments?
*Expand*

Students must be available Monday through Friday for a total of 30 hours per week between 8 AM - 6 PM (depending on lab assignment) for the duration of the six-week program (June 29 – August 8). Participation in summer school or other activities that conflict with these hours is not permitted.

Does the program include weekends or holidays?
*Expand*

The Youth Science Fellowship Program takes place **Monday through Friday**, and students are required to attend all scheduled program days.

Campus will be closed on **Friday, July 3, 2026** in observance of the July 4 holiday — there will be **no program activities on this day.**

Students are also **required to attend the Final Presentation Day / Scientific Poster Symposium** on **Saturday, August 1, 2026**, where they will present their research experience to family, friends, lab members, and the CRI community.

This culminating event is a key part of the program and marks the completion of the fellowship.

How many students are selected each year?
*Expand*

We aim to select approximately 20 students each year, depending on the number of participating labs. We typically receive over 100 applications annually.

## Application Information

Which biology and chemistry classes do I need to complete?
*Expand*

To ensure applicants are prepared to engage in rigorous laboratory research, all applicants must have completed a biology course AND a chemistry course.

Students who are **currently enrolled** in either biology or chemistry at the time of application are still eligible to apply, as these courses will be completed before the program begins in the summer.

What transcript do I need to submit?
*Expand*

You must upload a PDF of your transcript to your online application. The document must include your unweighted GPA and current course schedule. **We cannot accept links to external portals.**

Do you review applications on a rolling basis?
*Expand*

No — all applications are reviewed in one batch after the deadline, not on a rolling basis. See the program timeline for details.

When will I know if I’m selected?
*Expand*

Selection results will be communicated to all applicants by end of March.

## Recommendation Form

Who should complete my recommendation form?
*Expand*

On your application, you must **list** **one teacher** who is familiar with your interest in science and can complete a recommendation form for you. Be sure to inform your recommender ahead of time.

When are letters of recommendation due?
*Expand*

Once your application is submitted, we will send your recommender a **unique link** with instructions on how to complete the recommendation form. In order to consider your application complete, the form must be completed by the application due date on **January 30, 2026.**

## Selected Students

Is transportation provided?
*Expand*

Students will need to arrange their own transportation to/from campus. The CRI may provide bus passes or parking passes to eligible students. Students are also encouraged to carpool based on parent permission.

Do I have to pay for campus parking?
*Expand*

Yes. Parking is **not covered by the program**, and students are responsible for their own transportation and parking costs.

However, if you anticipate needing assistance obtaining a parking permit or using public transportation, please indicate this on your application. The CRI office may be able to provide limited support for eligible students (e.g., parking permit or bus pass sponsorship).

When will I receive my lab assignment?
*Expand*

After you receive your acceptance letter, you will be asked to complete a brief pre-program survey to help us match you with a research mentor and lab. Lab placements will be confirmed prior to the start of the program.

When is orientation?
*Expand*

Orientation takes place during the first day of the program on Monday, June 29, 2026. All required forms and safety trainings in your welcome packet must be completed **before the first day**. If your forms are incomplete by orientation day, you cannot participate and will be removed from the program.

**Please email the CRI office at [cri@uci.edu](mailto:cri@uci.edu) if you have further questions. Thank you!**
