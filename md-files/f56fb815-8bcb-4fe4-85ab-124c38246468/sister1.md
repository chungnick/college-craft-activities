## How to Apply

With over 300 courses available, Brown Pre-College provides you a range of opportunities to explore your passions and engage your potential. Brown University's Pre-College Program offers groupings of courses or [academic programs](https://precollege.brown.edu/programs) that focus on an area of study.

In your application, you will be asked to share which academic programs you are interested in participating in. That selection does not limit your choice in academic programs or courses. The only limitations to enrolling in the academic program or course of your choosing are eligibility based on age and grade level, any prerequisites listed in course descriptions, a student’s English language proficiency and whether the academic program or course has space available once a student is ready to enroll.

To begin an application:

1. Create your account on the [Student Portal](https://brownprecollege.my.site.com/PCPortal). Be sure to create only one account per applicant. All applications are submitted electronically within your student portal.
2. Complete your application form in your student portal. More information about the specific components of our application can be found within the [Application Checklist](https://precollege.brown.edu/apply/application-checklist).
3. Please monitor your student portal once you have submitted your application, as you may receive communications if any components are missing or incomplete. Admissions decisions will also be posted to your student portal.

Please note that applications will not be reviewed until all requirements are fulfilled. Check if your application is complete by using our handy [application checklist](https://precollege.brown.edu/apply/application-checklist).
