## Preparing the next generation of STEM leaders

**ONLINE APPLICATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE: JANUARY 7, 2026, 8:00 AM  
DEADLINE FOR ALL APPLICATION MATERIAL:  FEBRUARY 6, 2026, 11:59 PM**

**COSMOS is Limited to California High-School Students Only**

**\*\* COSMOS is a full residential and in-person program. In case of sudden circumstances that prevent in-person instruction of the planned curriculum, COSMOS may temporarily change the instructional format or the remaining program duration to, e.g., remote instruction to complete the program for the affected students. \*\***

**COSMOS** is an intensive four-week summer residential **Pre-College Program** for high school students who have demonstrated an aptitude for academic and professional careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Talented and motivated students completing grades 8-12 have the opportunity to work with renowned faculty, researchers, and scientists in state-of-the-art facilities while exploring advanced STEM topics far beyond the courses usually offered in California high schools. COSMOS fosters its students’ interests, skills, and awareness of educational and career options in STEM fields through challenging curricula that are both hands-on and lab-intensive.  
  
Students apply to ONE of the listed University of California’s COSMOS campuses — UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Cruz. While each campus employs the best practices in STEM education, each program's curriculum builds on its faculty and host campus's unique teaching and research expertise. Each campus can only accommodate about 160-200 participants. The selection is competitive. A typical COSMOS student has a GPA of 3.5 or above. In addition, students must have achieved academic excellence.
