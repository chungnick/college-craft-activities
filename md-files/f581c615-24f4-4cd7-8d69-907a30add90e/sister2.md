## 2026 Program Fees

**PAYMENTS**

* Application Fee:**$46(Non-refundable)**
* **For Admitted Students:** The four-week residential program costs **$5,518(Non-Refundable)**. Cost includes housing, meals, orientation, field trips & activities, and on-site support.
* Non-refundable Application fee and Program costs
* For payments made by credit card, a 2.5% transaction fee applies. The Application Fee is exempt from this service fee. The transaction fee is charged by the third-party processor, not COSMOS, and is not refundable even if the payment to which it relates is canceled, refunded, credited, or charged back.
* University banking policy dictates that we assess this transaction fee separately from the program cost. Thus, you will be asked to submit two payments: 1) program costs and 2) the service fee.
* If you choose to pay by credit card, you must submit both the payment and the service fee before the stated deadlines for your admission to be complete.
* Check or money orders must be postmarked by the deadline stated in the parent portal.
* COSMOS strongly recommends that payments and other time-sensitive mail be shipped as certified.

\*\*\*Make check or money order payable to**"UC REGENTS" (not COSMOS)**\*\*\*

Please note on the check to which campus you are applying, i.e., COSMOS UCD, and include the applicant's name.

**DISCLAIMER:**  COSMOS is not responsible for lost, held, or damaged mail. COSMOS is not responsible for delivery errors via carrier or incorrect shipping info. PLEASE CHECK YOUR INFORMATION, and do not request a signature upon delivery. COSMOS strongly recommends registered or certified mail with tracking.
