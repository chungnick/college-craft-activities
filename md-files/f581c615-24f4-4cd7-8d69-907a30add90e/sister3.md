## Financial Assistance

**ABOUT**  
Applying for financial assistance is optional, and availability depends on the success of our annual fundraising and on the sustainability of financial aid for students in need. All decisions and distributions of any financial assistance are handled centrally as a single process for all applicants, regardless of which campus they apply to. Financial aid funds are the result of generous foundations, corporations, and individual donors who care about the success of COSMOS students. For more information about donating or learning about our donors, visit our [giving site](https://give.ucdavis.edu/COSO).

**HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM COST DOES FINANCIAL AID COVER?**  
Providing access to admitted students is critical to our mission in serving the State of California.

Financial assistance is available to support both the application process and program attendance for students with demonstrated financial need. Detailed requirements for assistance are outlined in the application portal.

The level of financial support provided may vary annually, depending on available COSMOS resources and the review of submitted family documentation. As a result, COSMOS cannot guarantee a specific rubric or amount of assistance for the upcoming program. Each application is evaluated individually based on the information provided. Only complete financial assistance applications that meet the stated requirements and are submitted by the deadline will be considered.

**WILL A FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION AFFECT ADMISSION?**  
No. The admission review of applications is entirely detached from the review of applications for financial assistance.

Please refer to the application portal for details on how to apply for financial assistance.
