# Pre-College Program

[Resources and Policies](/academics/youth-and-teen-programs/pre-college/resources-and-policies)

**SVA Pre-College** is designed for high school students who want to enhance their creative skills, explore a specific field of art, develop a portfolio, and experience the challenges and triumphs that come with attending a dynamic visual arts college. All courses are taught by the same industry-leading professional faculty who teach in the undergraduate program at the School of Visual Arts. Students will explore the fundamentals of art and design at a level not readily available in high school.

Students will receive three credits for the successful completion of the summer program and one college credit for the successful completion of the fall or spring program. The fall and spring programs are open to all students who will be enrolled in high school at the time of the program and must be at least 14–18 years old; the summer program is open to all students who will be entering their freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior year of high school in the fall of 2026.

# About Summer Pre-College

  ### [Independence & Engagement](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-0)

  **One of the most valuable lessons Pre-College may teach is how to navigate life as an art college student in a major urban environment.** As opposed to a traditional summer camp, SVA Pre-College offers students the opportunity to balance structured and unstructured time out of the classroom and the option to live in an SVA Residence Hall in Manhattan.

  All Pre-College students, including commuters, are encouraged to attend our many hosted extracurricular activities at night and on weekends, such as movie and trivia nights, city walking tours, museum outings, Broadway shows, and many other planned excursions around NYC.

  After class ends, and prior to the residential curfew, Pre-College students are permitted to explore New York City and find what our metropolis has to offer. With the exception of a hosted extracurricular outing, students are not supervised when they are outside of SVA buildings. This level of independence is a purposeful aspect of the program, akin to being a college student. Families should understand this level of independence when signing up for the program.

  ### [Getting Around Our Campus](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-1)

  **SVA has an [urban campus](https://sva.edu/contact-and-maps).** This means that our buildings are not contiguous, but are instead situated across the east and west sides of lower Manhattan—between the Gramercy and Chelsea neighborhoods. Students are expected to travel on their own (typically by foot) to and from classes and arrive punctually. On the first day of classes only, students residing on campus will be escorted to their scheduled class by Pre-College staff.

  ### [Curfew & Code of Conduct](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-2)

  **For those students staying in our Residence Hall, a mandatory curfew check occurs nightly: Sunday through Thursday at 10:00pm and Friday through Saturday at 11:00pm.** In addition, Pre-College students are required to adhere to a strict Code of Conduct that must be agreed upon before online registration. This includes (but is not limited to) possession or use of alcohol, drugs, theft of personal property, damage to premises, and sexual relations. Failure to appear for curfew, or abide by the Pre-College Code of Conduct, may result in expulsion from the program.
