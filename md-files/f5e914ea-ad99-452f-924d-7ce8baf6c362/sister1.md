  ### [Does Pre-College have an application?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-0)

  There is no application for SVA's Pre-College program. Instead, students are enrolled in the program once the tuition cost has been paid. Students can visit our [webpage](https://sva.edu/pc) to see all available courses. From there, students can click on the course they are most interested in attending and click the "Register" button. This will walk you through our online registration process, culminating in a payment screen.

  All seats are offered on a first-come, first-served basis.

  ### [Can I pay in installments?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-1)

  Unfortunately, we are unable to provide students with a payment plan. However, students can purchase housing and the meal plan independently of tuition.

  To do this, students can register [online](https://sva.edu/pc), paying for the course they are interested in, and then contact us via email at a later date to purchase housing and/or the meal plan.

  ### [What is your refund policy?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-2)

  **Refund requests must be received in writing and emailed to precollege@sva.edu. Please include the student’s full name and course number.**

  Refunds are processed within four to six weeks of the request date. If the original form of payment is a credit card, that card will be credited. All other types of payments for the program will be processed in the form of a check made payable to the student and sent via postal mail to the student’s mailing address on file.

  **Summer Pre-College Refund Policies:**

  The effective date of the withdrawal or cancellation is the date that written notification sent to [precollege@sva.edu](mailto:precollege@sva.edu) is received by the Program Manager. Lack of attendance alone does not entitle a student to a refund.

  Refunds, less the nonrefundable program fee, are made after the prorated percentages of liability is applied. Prorated housing costs are based on the check-out date, not the official date of withdrawal or cancellation.

  **Note: The $500 program fee is nonrefundable.**

  **Tuition Policy:**The prorated percentages of liability (tuition and fees owed) are based on the official date of withdrawal or cancellation.

  + 0% liability if withdrawal occurs before the program begins
  + 55% liability if withdrawal occurs during the first week of the program
  + 80% liability if withdrawal occurs during the second week of the program
  + 100% liability if withdrawal occurs after the second week of the program
  + No refund will occur for withdrawal after the second week of the program

  **Housing Policy:**Prorated housing costs are based on the check-out date, not the official date of withdrawal.

  + 0% liability if withdrawal/cancellation occurs before the program begins
  + 55% liability if withdrawal/cancellation occurs during the first week of the program
  + 100% liability if withdrawal/cancellation occurs after the first week of the program
  + No refund will occur for withdrawal/cancellation after the first week of the program

  **Meal Plan Policy:**

  + Students who register for the meal plan may request a refund within three days of the program’s start. After this date, no refunds will be granted.

  **Fall/Spring Pre-College Refund Policies:**

  + 0% liability if withdrawal occurs before the program begins
  + 10% liability if withdrawal occurs during the first week of the program
  + 20% liability if withdrawal occurs during the second week of the program

  ### [How can I obtain a transcript?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-3)

  Official SVA eTranscripts can be requested [here](https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/ficecode/00746800) and will be delivered as a secure PDF file via email within the same day. If you have any outstanding holds on your account, those must be cleared before transcripts will be released.

  ### [Does SVA provide airport transportation?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-4)

  **SVA does not offer a pick-up service from or to the airports.**

  Students may arrange for a car service or use the regulated New York City medallion yellow taxicabs. LaGuardia and JFK airports are the most convenient airports for traveling to and from SVA. Look for the “Ground Transportation” signs when exiting the airport.

  **Only enter New York City medallion yellow taxicabs or official cars provided by trusted rideshare services such as Uber or Lyft.**

  ### [What types of extra-curricular activities are availble?](#accordion-v-0-0-0-0-3-0-5)

  All commuter and housing students attending the summer program are encouraged to register and participate in program activities. Activities are scheduled Monday through Friday after class and on weekends.

  There are no additional fees to participate in program activities. However, students are required to provide their own subway fare (both to and from off-campus activities).

  Students living in SVA housing have the opportunity to explore New York City independently, but must comply with curfew. Please be advised that if your child attends the program and chooses not to join a chaperoned activity, they are responsible for their own safety. SVA is an urban-style campus, and the city is our home. New York City is as safe as any other major city, but it's essential to understand that students must be self-aware and prepared for an urban environment.

  **Please note: Due to the time required to obtain an F-1 visa, International Students should register for Summer Pre-College by April 1.**

  Due to the time required to apply for the F-1 student visa at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad, SVA cannot guarantee the timely delivery of the I-20 form if documents are received after the deadline. Longer wait times and visa processing times are expected this summer due to recent changes.

  **Information and Resources:** For more information on the F-1 Visa process, please visit our webpage [here](https://sva.edu/students/international-students/f1-students?parentId=1612).
