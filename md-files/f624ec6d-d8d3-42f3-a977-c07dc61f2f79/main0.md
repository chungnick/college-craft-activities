# Summer Session

### Challenge yourself. Earn college credit. Prepare for college success.

## Program Overview

Pre-College Summer Session provides high school students with the unique opportunity to take summer courses offered by Carnegie Mellon University for credit.

Students earn college credit while working in an academic setting that mirrors the supportive, rigorous environment of the first year of college. Every year, Summer Session offers approximately thirty courses from academic disciplines across the university, including: science, humanities, social science, engineering, computer science, and technology applied to the arts. Successful Summer Session students leverage their experiences to demonstrate their ability to succeed in college. Upon successful completion of a course, they receive college credit at Carnegie Mellon University, which is transferable to other institutions that accept CMU college courses for credit.

**Please note that admittance into Pre-College Summer Session does not guarantee admittance to Carnegie Mellon University within the Undergraduate Admission process.**

## Curriculum

The Summer Session program is comprised of undergraduate-level Carnegie Mellon courses. The courses are the same ones taken during the fall and spring by Carnegie Mellon students, usually in their first or second years. Students will tackle the same rigorous, college-level work as an undergraduate student studying at Carnegie Mellon. All of the Summer Session instructors are vetted by their respective academic departments, and the majority of them are Carnegie Mellon professors who teach these courses during the academic year.

**Students request their courses after admission to the program, as part of the enrollment process completed in the spring (typically in March).**

Students living on campus must remain enrolled in two courses throughout the entire summer program (six weeks). Students living at home (who must have a permanent local address) may enroll in either one or two courses. Two courses completed in six weeks is as academically demanding as a full-time undergraduate course schedule.

Courses offered remain relatively similar from year to year. Please see our [2025 Summer Session](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m7A3Tkf8wVRC5DV0KXAHGRcw4eKaa3VA/view?usp=drive_link) course list. We do not offer any courses online.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How difficult is the coursework?**

In Summer Session, students have the opportunity to take actual Carnegie Mellon courses, often alongside undergraduate students. While most students will be challenged due to the college rigor and pace of the six-week courses, the university seeks to support the education of everyone accepted into the program. If you have questions about the difficulty of the program, please contact the Program Director. We would be happy to discuss further.

**How much time will I need to commit to my coursework each week?**

Because Summer Session offers typical university courses at an accelerated rate, two courses is considered a fulltime workload. Despite this, students will have some variation in the amount of time required for their coursework depending on their course selection. Courses offered typically range from nine to twelve units, which are comparable to 3-credit and 4-credit courses at other universities. During Summer Session, students enrolled in a 9-unit course should expect to spend 21 hours on average on that class per week, including class time. Students enrolled in a 12-unit course should expect to spend 28 hours on average on that class per week, including class time.

**Will I need to purchase textbooks for my courses?**

Students will need to purchase any learning materials, including textbooks, at their own cost. Lab classes may also require additional lab fees. (Note: The cost of textbooks is not included in a scholarship award.) Required materials can be found on either your course syllabus or the [Canvas site](https://canvas.cmu.edu/). Consult the Canvas page for your course (if applicable), the [CMU Bookstore](https://bookstore.web.cmu.edu/home), or your professor for further guidance.

**What do I need to do if I miss a class?**

Students are required to attend all class meetings, but we understand that absences are sometimes unavoidable. If a student misses a class meeting, it is their responsibility to make up any missed work. Students should reach out to the instructor to discuss further if needed. Please know that Summer Session classes are the same classes that are offered to CMU undergraduate students; therefore, instructors will have the same performance expectations for Pre-College students as for undergraduate students. 

**Are remote courses offered or an option?**

All Summer Session courses require in-person attendance, and no remote options are available. 

**Can I plan a vacation or depart early during the program?**

Due to the rigorous coursework in a condensed term, combined with the expectations surrounding class attendance, students should not plan any vacation or time away from campus during the 6-week program. Students may have final exams on the last day (Friday, July 31, 2026) of the program, so please coordinate your travel home on the six-week move-out day (Saturday, August 1, 2026).

**What is the grading policy for Pre-College Summer Session?**

Each instructor will announce their grading policy in their course syllabus for determining letter grades (A, B, C, D, and R, with no + or – grades) based upon student performance. Pre-College Summer Session courses cannot be taken on an Audit or Pass/Fail basis, nor are Incomplete grades possible. 

To minimize the risk of Pre-College students taking university-level courses, we offer a grade forgiveness policy to Pre-College Summer Session students. Grade forgiveness policy will not apply to students who cannot remain in good academic standing (e.g. not following class attendance and participation policies stated in Pre-College Student Handbook, Code of Conduct, Policies and Procedures, not submitting assigned work, or committing academic integrity violations). This Pre-College Summer Session grade forgiveness policy is not the normal grading policy for undergraduate Carnegie Mellon students, but rather a special policy for the Pre-College students seeking to test their backgrounds and skills in challenging university courses without the penalty of failure or low grades. 

Under our grade forgiveness policy the University Registrar will only retain A and B grades on Summer Session students' permanent record, including their official Carnegie Mellon transcript. No C, D, nor R grades will be retained in permanent records for students in good academic standing. Students eligible for this policy may request to have C grades officially retained on their Carnegie Mellon transcript by contacting the University Registrar. A grade of C is generally an “average” grade for a course and is considered a passing grade. The C grade will count for academic credit at Carnegie Mellon but may not be eligible for external transfer credit depending on the policy of other institutions. 

**What are the academic integrity policies for Pre-College Summer Session?**

Pre-College Summer Session students at Carnegie Mellon University are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence and academic integrity. Therefore, students are expected to meet the highest standards of conduct while on campus. Actions that undermine these high standards including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and receiving or providing unauthorized assistance, are considered academic integrity violations. Course-specific policies regarding academic integrity may be set on a course-by-course basis by the instructors and will be documented in course syllabi, which will be provided to students no later than the first day of classes. Policies may vary substantially between courses, and students are responsible for reviewing and abiding by each course's policies. If a student is unsure of a policy, they are encouraged to check with their instructor. Not being familiar with a documented policy is not an acceptable excuse for violating it. Failure to honestly respond to an academic integrity violation may also be considered a violation.

Penalties for academic integrity violations are severe and may include a reduced assignment grade, a reduced course grade, or a failing course grade. Students found to have committed academic integrity violation(s) are not eligible for our Pre-College Summer Session grade forgiveness policy for courses related to the violation(s), and these grades will remain on their transcript.

**How can parents and guardians support students who are enrolled in Pre-College Summer Session?**

Pre-College Summer Session provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop the skills necessary to navigate their academic endeavors independently. Parents and guardians will shift to a supportive role while their student is enrolled in Pre-College Summer Session, and students are expected to take the lead in managing their coursework and communicating with their instructors. Students enrolled in Pre-College Summer Session courses are academically considered matriculated adults, even if they are not yet 18. As a result, their personal and academic information is protected under [FERPA](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/privacy/index.html). Even if students are minors, guardians' access to their academic records at the university is limited. Family and loved ones are encouraged to speak to their student for coursework and grade updates. They can support their student by discussing the program’s expectations with students, ensuring they understand the program policies as communicated by our team, and empowering their students to take charge of their studies.

**How many classes can students take? Is there a limit?**

Students who enroll in two courses (between 9 and 12 units each, comparable to 3 to 4 credits each at other colleges and universities) will experience fast-paced academic work. The workload of two courses completed over six weeks will be similar to the workload of five courses in 14 weeks, which is a typical workload for degree-seeking undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon. Pre-College Summer Session students may enroll in up to 24 units.

We strongly recommend that students enrolled in two courses focus on this program during the six weeks. Do not plan to engage in other studies during Summer Session, including preparation for standardized tests or major school assignments. Students will be taking college courses, and it is critical to focus on this.

**Is it possible to have a job while attending Pre-College Summer Session?**

Students enrolled in two full courses should not plan to have a summer job. Commuter students enrolled in fewer than two full courses may wish to consider a part-time summer job.

**Will the college credits be transferable?**

Every university and college has the authority to determine its own policies about whether to accept credits from another institution of higher education.

While it is therefore impossible to state definitively that these college credits will transfer elsewhere, the following statements are true:

* Carnegie Mellon considers these to be college credits.
* Carnegie Mellon offers rigorous coursework.
* Carnegie Mellon is a widely recognized institution.
* In order to make a strong case for transfer credits, a student must do well in the course and have that grade recorded. Students are responsible for saving course syllabi and other course documentation that may later be required to evaluate their coursework for transfer.

**How can I receive a copy of my transcript or send an official transcript to a requesting institution?**

You may order an electronic version of your transcript, or send your transcript to a requesting institution, through the National Student Clearinghouse. See the Alumni/Former Students section on the following page for more information: <https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/>.

It is best to wait until final grades have been submitted before requesting your transcript so that you do not need to order additional copies. You may check Student Information Online (SIO) to see your grades while you still have access. Your transcript will not be released if you have an account balance, so please ensure that you have paid any remaining balance as soon as possible. You may check your account balance in SIO. 

***Important note:***As soon as transcripts are opened (whether by envelope or electronically), they are considered "unofficial." This is because the transcript could be tampered with once opened. If an institution requests an official version of your transcript, you should send the transcript to the institution directly through the National Student Clearinghouse (link above).

**What if a student decides they don't like the courses they are taking?**

With the permission of the academic program director, students may be able to change classes during the first two days of the program. Such changes are subject to space availability and academic appropriateness. No new course registrations are possible after the first two days of the program.

**If I am a Summer Session commuter student enrolled in two courses, can I drop one course?**  
  
Yes. Summer Session commuter students who are registered for two courses can drop one course before Friday, June 26, 2026. Course drops will not be allowed after this deadline. Per approval by the Pre-College Office, a partial tuition refund may be possible when one course is dropped before the deadline. No refunds will be available after Friday, June 26, 2026, including for full withdrawals from the program. Commuter students who wish to drop a course before the deadline should contact the academic program director for assistance.

**If I am a Summer Session residential student enrolled in two courses, can I drop one course?**  
  
No. Residential students enrolled in Pre-College Summer Session must be enrolled in two courses for the duration of the program and may not drop below this course load.

## **Age and Grade**

**Age:** You must be 16 years of age by June 20, 2026.  
**Grade:** You must be in high school between 10th and 11th grade or 11th and 12th grade during the summer of 2026.
