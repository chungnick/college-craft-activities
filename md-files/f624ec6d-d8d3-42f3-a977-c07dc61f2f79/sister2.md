# Transcripts

## A Carnegie Mellon University transcript is a student's official documentation of courses completed and degrees awarded. This includes courses and final grades for each semester. It always includes both the undergraduate and graduate record (if applicable), as well as any transfer or advanced placement credits.

## This page serves as a guide to students and alumni who wish to [order an official transcript](#request) and those who wish to [submit a transcript](#submit) for transfer credit.

## Prospective Undergraduate Students

If you are a prospective undergraduate student, transcripts for admission should be submitted to the [Office of Undergraduate Admission](https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/undergraduate-admission-requirements) or [admission@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:admission@andrew.cmu.edu).

# Submitting a Transcript for Transfer Credit

To be considered for transfer credit from another accredited institution, currently enrolled students must have their official transcripts sent to the University Registrar's office either electronically or through mail.  Unofficial transcripts, screenshots, or personal copies of transcripts are not accepted. We can only accept transcripts directly from students if the contents are in an official, sealed, and unopened envelope.

**Transcripts should be submitted to one of the following addresses, depending on medium:**

Electronic: [cmuregistrar@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:cmuregistrar@andrew.cmu.edu)

By mail: Carnegie Mellon University  
                University Registrar's Office  
                5000 Forbes Ave,  Warner Hall A19  
                Pittsburgh, PA 15213

Upon receipt, the University Registrar's Office will verify the official transcript and send a copy of the transcript to the appropriate academic department responsible for the student's transfer credit decisions.  The official transcript will reside in the student's academic file.

Students interested in learning more about transferring credits from classes taken over the summer, while studying abroad, or during a leave of absence may visit the [Transfer Credit](../../registration/transfer-transcripts.html) webpage.

Students interested in taking courses for credit at one of the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) affiliate schools may visit the [Cross-Registration (PCHE)](../../registration/cross/index.html) webpage.
