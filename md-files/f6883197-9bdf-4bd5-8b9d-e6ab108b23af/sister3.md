# Vassar English Language Learners Outreach Program (VELLOP)

The Vassar English Language Learners Outreach Program (VELLOP) partners with the Poughkeepsie City School District to advance language access and educational equity for multilingual students. Many classrooms do not have a dedicated ELL teacher, and VELLOP tutors provide meaningful supports so that students receive the resources they need to fully participate and succeed.

VELLOP tutors often draw on their own Spanish language skills to help bridge communication, build understanding, and strengthen learning environments where students’ bilingualism is celebrated as an asset. By working alongside individual teachers, VELLOP creates more inclusive classrooms where multilingual students can thrive academically and socially.

VELLOP also allows Vassar students to learn with and from local youth and families, connecting their studies of education and social justice to real-world practice. At its core, VELLOP is about language justice, reciprocity, and building partnerships that ensure immigrant and multilingual families have the access, support, and opportunities they deserve.

## Early Learning Center

At the Early Learning Center, VELLOP supports young multilingual learners in building the foundational literacy and math skills that will carry them forward in their educational journeys. Vassar tutors are paired directly with students, following their progress throughout the semester and providing consistent, individualized support.

## Poughkeepsie High School

At Poughkeepsie High School, VELLOP mentors work one-on-one and in small groups with students in their content-area classes, helping ensure that multilingual learners have the language access and resources they need to fully participate and succeed. Mentors also share strategies that strengthen learning across all subjects, while supporting students in developing their reading skills and planning for their academic and career futures.

At least once each semester, VELLOP high school students visit Vassar College for enrichment opportunities—such as touring the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center or attending a student theater performance—that highlight the resources of the college and foster connections between campuses.

## Our Impact

Together, VELLOP serves over 150 students in 15 different classrooms each semester, with the support of more than 30 Vassar mentors.
