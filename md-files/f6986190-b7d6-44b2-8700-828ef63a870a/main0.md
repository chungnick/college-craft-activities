### UCLA Writing Project Summer Camp

**Instructor: Gilda De La Cruz, Sasha Avila**

Share your unique perspective through writing and learning from others. In this close-knit community of learners, you will develop your writing skills while engaging in relevant social issues. The workshop will focus on a range of writing genres, including poetry, the narrative essay, and argumentative writing.

To help develop your “personal academic voice,” you will read stimulating texts, engage in debate, and participate in the writing process. One part of the process involves receiving personalized feedback from peers and instructor to help you fine-tune your ideas and the way you express them. But as author, you have authority—and have the last word!

Whatever your current writing abilities, this workshop will help you sharpen and refine your skills while making real connections with your peers.

**Fee: $650**
