# Frequently Asked Questions

#### 

**Is Tech Camp intended primarily for students who already have a strong background in STEM subjects?**  
Tech Camp is for everyone! We welcome students of all skill levels and backgrounds — an inquisitive mind and sense of adventure are all that are required to enroll!  Tech Camp can be the first place that a student learns about an array of STEM subject areas and how they might pursue them in college or as a career. Tech Camp opens doors that students didn't even know existed!  
  
**Is financial support available?**   
Our goal is to make Tech Camp accessible to all who are interested! Thanks to special grant funding, a number of our programs are offered at no cost. Financialassistance for non-sponsored programs is available as well, and can be used to cover tuition expenses as well as on-campus housing. When filling out the application, you will see a section devoted to financial aid. This information helps determine eligibility for assistance.   
  
**W****hy do I need to fill out an application?**   
The application process helps us ensure that each of our programs includes a diverse cross-section of students, which creates a more dynamic learning environment for all. The application also helps us direct financial assistance to those in need.  
  
**Are campers required to live on campus?**  
We understand that living on campus in a dorm is not for everyone, so we offer both day and [residential](/outreach/tech-camp/about/campus-housing "On-Campus Housing") options for students. More than 50 percent of our campers choose to live on campus.  
  
**What if my child’s first program choice is full?**  
Students will have the opportunity to select their first and second choice of programs when they apply. If their first-choice program is full, they will be placed in their second-choice program. If an instance of both programs being full occurs, families will be contacted to see if there is another option of interest available.  
  
**Does my child need to be a NH resident to attend?**  
No. In years past participants have come from all over New England, the wider U.S., and even from overseas. All are welcome!  
  
**Who are the teachers at Tech Camp?**  
Our programs are led by UNH faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students or area high school STEM teachers. All bring a wealth of experience, knowledge and enthusiasm to the classroom and a love for STEM education at all levels.  
  
**What is project-based learning?**  
Project-based learning is astudent-centered approach to teaching that involves a dynamic classroom environment in which students engage in hands-on activities and experiments to explore subject matter and address real-world challenges and problems.

**Can I get high school credit for attending Tech Camp?**  
Yes! UNH has partnered with the [Virtual Learning Academy Charter School](https://vlacs.org/) (VLACS) to provide high school students with an opportunity to earn credit in conjunction with their participation in Tech Camp. [L](/outreach/tech-camp/about/earn-high-school-credit "Earn High School Credit")[earn more about high school credit](/outreach/tech-camp/about/earn-high-school-credit "Earn High School Credit").
