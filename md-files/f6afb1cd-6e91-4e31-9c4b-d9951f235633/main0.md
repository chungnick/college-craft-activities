# Upward Bound

Participants of the 2019 Summer Residential Academy

Upward Bound is an early intervention pre-college program that helps students prepare for higher education. Upward Bound brings high school students to college campuses after school, on the weekends, and during the summer to receive instruction in mathematics, laboratory sciences, composition, literature, and foreign languages. Tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment, and work-study programs are additional components to the Upward Bound program. The NC State University program serves 186 students annually from five high schools (Vance County High School, Louisburg High School, Bunn High School, Franklinton High School and East Wake High School). The program has been a part of the university since 1978 and has assisted hundreds of students to enroll in college and gain a college degree.
