Join a global community for entrepreneurship and innovation. Develop ideas and solutions for today’s challenges together with like-minded people.

***At the Entrepreneurship Campus, ideas turn into real change.***

[***CEC 2026: 2 March - 5 June***](https://entrepreneurship.de/en/competition-procedure)

**If you want to start, experiment, and truly make an impact, the CEC is the right place for you! At the CEC, you get everything you need to turn your ideas into reality: a global community, valuable knowledge, targeted networking and all of it for free. Here, people come together who don’t settle for the status quo but take action, spot opportunities, and shape the future.**

### What is the CEC and How does it work?

The Citizen Entrepreneurship Competition (CEC) is aimed especially at young entrepreneurs and empowers them to develop ideas for a more peaceful and sustainable world. Participants are encouraged to create ideas with social impact and to actively contribute to one or more of the [17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), which address the key social, economic, environmental, and health challenges of our time. Entrepreneurs from age 13 and up are invited to submit their ideas and become part of an international community.

**The competition runs in three phases:**

1. **Idea Submission & Entrepreneurial Design:** Submit a short pitch, have it reviewed against the [competition criteria](https://entrepreneurship.de/en/competition-procedure), complete the courses, and fill out the Entrepreneurial Design Canvas (EDC).
2. **Voting:** All ideas are published, and participants can gather votes while supporting each other.
3. **Jury Decision:** The ten submissions with the most votes are evaluated by an expert jury and the winners are selected.

The Entrepreneurship Campus now connects members from 141 nations, encouraging discussion, networking, feedback, and peer support. The CEC has been held annually since 2014.

## What the CEC Teaches (Young) Entrepreneurs

#### Sustainable & Impact-Driven Entrepreneurship

**Learn how to develop an idea that combines economic viability with real social value.**

The CEC guides you in aligning your idea/project with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). You’ll discover how to create meaningful impact, design sustainable solutions, and integrate responsibility into your entrepreneurial design.

#### Entrepreneurial Design & Business Model Development

**Build a strong and creative business model. Step by step.**

Through the Entrepreneurial Design Canvas (EDC) and two online courses, you learn to structure and refine your idea: from vision and feasibility to financing and long-term impact. You identify opportunities, reduce risks, and design a model that fits your vision and your life.

#### Feedback, Visibility & Global Community

**Grow through feedback – worldwide.**

The CEC gives you access to a vibrant global community. You receive feedback on your idea, expand your network, and get professional input from an international jury in the final round. Your project becomes more visible and evolves through real-world exchange.
