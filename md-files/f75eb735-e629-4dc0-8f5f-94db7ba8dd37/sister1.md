# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

##### SPARC: The Summer Program for Automation Robotics and Coding (SPARC) introduces students to the basics of robotics, mechatronics, and programming. This is a 2-week, full-day summer program for rising 9th through 12th-grade high school students. Students do not need experience in robotics to participate in SPARC, but should be academically strong students with an interest in robotics and the ability to take initiative. During the program, students will learn about applications for microcontrollers, interface sensors, and actuators through hands-on manipulation of the components provided in their robotics kit.

###### Hands-On Robotics & Engineering

###### Build and program interactive robotic devices using microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.

###### Foundational Programming Skills

###### Learn coding constructs like variables, conditionals, loops, and binary code to bring robots to life.

###### Program Electrical & Mechanical Engineering

###### Gain experience with circuitry, electronic components, and automation systems.

###### Robot Competitions & Challenges

###### Put your robot to the test in tournament-style challenges, where students compete in tasks and real-world robotics scenarios

### Build and program robots while learning core concepts in automation and robotics engineering.

> "the robotics project was really great, and it was super fun to be able to build and program a robot with someone i met just a week earlier. we even won 2nd in the competition at the end, which was really cool. the environment was great -- even though we lost to the 1st place team, everyone was very encouraging. we had a lot of freedom to do whatever we wanted, which i liked a lot. SPARC gave me the confidence and experience i needed to pursue robotics in the future, and i even joined my school's robotics team a few months after..."

# STUDENT TESTIMONIALS

> "SPARC completely changed the course of my life because i really wanted to do computer science before that, and i only had programming experience before... now i applied to every one of my colleges as a mechanical engineering major. i really loved the projects with the arduino and breadboard, because it showed me that while electrical circuits look complicated, they are actually pretty simple once you get the hang of it. and the lesson about electricity actually helped me in my physics class the next year!

In today’s digital age, students are learning technology at younger ages. No matter what career students are interested in, gaining hands-on experience in tech-focused summer programs can help them gain valuable skills.

Students can gain hands-on experiences by attending summer programs focused on technology.

As summer approaches, students should consider attending a summer program concentrated on technology, especially if their school curriculum doesn’t offer them much opportunity to explore the field.
