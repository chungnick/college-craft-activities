# YSP Program Cost

# Program Cost

Overview July 22, 2020

### The cost for the six-week program is $7,750.

#### What is included?

* Housing and meals for the duration of the program
* 5 units of university credit
* Other activities during the program

#### Fee Reductions

Funds are available to assist those students who might otherwise
be unable to attend due to financial constraints. To request
consideration for a fee reduction the student should
submit a letter describing parent/guardian’s financial
obligations and need for support to the director by the
application deadline [HERE](https://forms.gle/P9dnMZNFhdR4AAuf7).

The amount of the fee reduction award will be based on
demonstrated need, the number of applicants who qualify and the
availability of funds. Fee reductions are allocated at the time
of program acceptance notification, therefore, requests for
consideration of a fee reduction will not be accepted following
admission to the program.

##### Fee reduction requests are reviewed after students are accepted into the program, and are not part of the program application review.

### There is an application fee of $45.

#### Application Fee Waiver

Applicants can request an application fee waiver by completing a
form [HERE](https://forms.gle/yznkacxH6KDtwN7o8). An
application fee waiver will be granted to any student who
requests one prior to the application deadline.
