# YSP FAQ

# Frequently Asked Questions

Overview November 27, 2018

#### Please check this page for answers to your questions before using the contact form.

### I am interested in applying.

#### When will applications open for this year?

The application period for the UC Davis Young Scholars Program
opens on January 1 and closes at 11:59 PM on March 1.
Students wishing to apply for the coming summer must create a
user account before beginning the application process. User
accounts may be created starting on January 1.

#### Do I have to be a resident of California to attend the Young Scholars Program?

No, you don’t have to be a resident of California to apply to and
attend the Young Scholars Program. We accept out-of-state
students who will be rising juniors or rising seniors during the
summer program. International students should refer to the
“International Students” page for additional information
that applies to international students only.

#### What is the cost of the program and what does the cost include?

The program fee covers room and board for six weeks, field trips,
program activities, and five (5) units of university Group Study
credit. The anticipated cost for the 2026 summer program is
$7500, plus a fully refundable $200 security deposit.

#### Are scholarships available? If so, how much?

Significant fee reductions are available on a sliding scale
based on need, the number of students requesting reductions, and
the amount of money available. We cannot give estimates of
possible fee reductions prior to the application deadline because
there are too many variables.

To be considered for a fee reduction, you must submit your
request for consideration at the time of application.
**These requests are not considered in the selection
process and are only reviewed after the selections have been
made.**

To request consideration for a fee reduction the student
should submit a letter describing the parent/guardians’
financial obligations and need for support to the
director by the application deadline (March 1) [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s7owjbGp7FW_LMtZBWInGUYE_yLCi04peYUWkA6-fY8/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)

#### What is the application deadline?

The application deadline is March 1 at 11:59 PM. The online
application must be submitted by the deadline, as well as any
requests for fee reduction. Applicants will be notified of
the review committee’s decisions on or before April 1.

#### Can I participate if I won’t be 16 years old by the start of the program?

The UC Davis Young Scholars Program requires all participants to
be at least 16 years of age by the first day of the program
but not 18 years of age before the end of the program. **No
exceptions are made and inquiries regarding exceptions will not
receive a reply.**

#### How can I begin my application for the UC Davis Young Scholars Program?

To begin your online application, you must create a new
account including a User Name and Password. Refer
to the “Application” page to begin. Please be sure that
cookies are enabled in your browser before beginning your
application.

#### If I’m accepted when will I be notified what my project will be?

If accepted you will be notified of your project when you
arrive on the first day of the program. The available research
projects vary year-to-year but you can visit the “Research
Projects” page to see overviews of projects students
have worked on in the past. We anticipate projects that are
similar in scope and subject area this year.

#### Can I go home on the weekends?

Program participation includes Saturday field trips. Students are
welcome to go home after returning from the weekend field trips
if they are signed out by a parent or guardian and return by
building curfew on Sunday evening.

Requests to be absent for Saturday field trips for special
occasions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Please use
the Contact form to email the Director with special
requests.

#### What is your acceptance rate?

UC Davis Young Scholars Program has an acceptance rate of about
10-15%. We accept 40 students per year.

#### Can I have a counselor or previous research mentor fill out a recommendation for me?

Recommendation forms should be filled out
by teachers. At least one of the recommendations must
come from a science teacher. Recommendations completed by
counselors are discouraged.

#### Are students required to live in the dorms or can I live with a family member in Davis?

The UC Davis Young Scholars Program is a residential program.
Participants are required to live in the dorm and can only be
checked out of the dorms for extended periods of time on a
temporary basis by a parent or guardian.

#### Do you accept supplemental application materials?

Supplemental application materials are not required and will not
be reviewed by the application committee.

#### Do you use a rolling admissions process?

No, all applications are reviewed at the same time after the
submission deadline.

#### Do citations in the essay questions count toward the total word count?

Yes.

#### Can you tell me in advance how much of a fee reduction I can get?

No, we do not pre-determine the level of fee reductions any
applicant might qualify for. What we can say is that every year
the UC Davis Young Scholars Program aims to award up to
$25,000 in fee reductions. In recent years we’ve been able to
award even greater fee reductions thanks to the generous support
of the Boroditsky Family Fund. These reductions are provided
to applicants who request consideration for the fee reduction at
the time of application. The amount of the fee reduction is based
on the family’s income, their specific financial circumstances,
the number of students requesting fee reductions, and the amount
of funding available.

### I have submitted an application.

#### The application portal says my application has been “Submitted” by the deadline. Will my application be reviewed?

The “Submitted” status indicates that you have completed the
school information, activities section, and personal essay
questions for the application and paid the application
fee. However, you might still be missing completed teacher
recommendations. Applications missing teacher
recommendations will not be reviewed. To make sure your
application is reviewed, your application status needs to be
“Completed,” and you’ll have seven green checkmarks.

#### The application portal says my application was “Completed” by the deadline. Will my application be reviewed?

Yes! That means you’ve submitted all the materials, paid the
application fee, and had your teachers complete the references.

#### Will UCD-YSP notify me when my application is received?

Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications we receive,
UCD-YSP is not able to confirm application submission.

#### One or both of my teachers haven’t completed the teacher references. Can they have more time?

While every effort should be made to submit teacher references by
the deadline (March 1), they will be accepted until March 5.
