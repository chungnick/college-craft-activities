To make the full experience of a Dartmouth education affordable for you and your family.

We know that the cost of education is considerable. We are committed to providing a need-based financial aid program that makes it financially possible for all admitted students to attend Dartmouth.

Our goal is to give each student the full Dartmouth experience by removing financial barriers. Whether from Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, or Texas, we will meet 100% of demonstrated need for every admitted student.
