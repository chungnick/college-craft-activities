**Coaches: Your team number(s) can be found on the PUMaC coach portal. If you have any further questions, please email us at pumac.staff@gmail.com!**

**Note: The overall weighting for Power Round will be slightly lowered compared to previous years**

This page serves as the homepage for the PUMaC 2025 Power Round. Students should sign up for the PUMaC 2025 Power Round [Piazza page](https://piazza.com/princeton/fall2025/pumac2025) in order to access the power round and submit clarifications. The access code is **2025!PowerRound**

The PUMaC 2025 Power Round may be updated occasionally as clarifications and corrections are issued. For a list of all clarifications/corrections posted, please check Piazza.

**Edit: If you downloaded the template before 12:20 PM EST, please redownload it (we missed a problem):**

For submitting solutions, you can find a PDF template [here](/s/PUMaC_2025_Power_Round_Template.pdf). The analogous TeX file may be accessed [here](/s/pumac_2025_power_template.tex). Submissions will take place on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) by enrolling in the class **PUMaC 2025** using the entry code **5DV2RY**. Please ensure only ONE student per team submits. To join, you should probably use a non-school Gradescope account, and you need to search for **Princeton University** as the school.
