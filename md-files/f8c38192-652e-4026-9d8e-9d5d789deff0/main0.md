* **Pass/No Pass:** A grade of P or NP reflects whether you have passed the course, but does not otherwise indicate your performance. These grades are not included in your GPA calculation; however a P (passing) grade counts toward your earned credit hours or the required number of units for your certificate.

This grade appears on your transcript, but is not included in your GPA calculation and is not counted toward your earned credit hours or the required number of units for your certificate.

You may change your grading option at any time before the final class meeting (by 11:59 p.m. on the day before the published end date for online courses) or before final grades are posted, whichever comes first.

The course location will be given to students once they have been accepted into the program, but does take place at a [UC San Diego Extended Studies location](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/about-us/locations).

Courses numbered 90000-99999 are non-credit-bearing, pre-college-level courses designed to provide an opportunity for students to explore academic interests or prepare for college admission.
