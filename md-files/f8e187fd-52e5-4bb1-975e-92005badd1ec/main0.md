# Leadership Institute for Future Teachers (LIFT)

The Leadership Institute for Future Teachers (LIFT) is a six-day, invitational program for students interested in teaching who are rising high school seniors in North Carolina. Over six days in the summer, students delve into the field of education through engaging in field-based school activities, interacting with leaders in education and exploring career options in education and related fields.

## Nominate a Student for LIFT

Please use this form to nominate a rising high school senior for the 2026 LIFT program at NC State. This form will close at 11:59 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 30, 2026. All nominations are due at that time.

[Nominate a student](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdk_EBJBDCrfx4ExRH0HVnarJjAm3gTY69duF7PKgS9qZpC3Q/viewform?usp=publish-editor)

> “There usually is a moment in life where you realize your dreams can become a reality. LIFT was that for me. I never saw myself as the principal of a school, so it’s amazing to think that this story started with going to visit NC State for a week because I told my 11th grade social studies teacher that I wanted to be a teacher.”

> “The bond established during the week of LIFT is cultivated and nurtured throughout a LIFT participant’s college experience. This is what makes LIFT not just a one-summer experience for participants but rather a lifelong bond between themselves and the program.”

> Founding Director of LIFT

## The History of LIFT

In the summer of 1986, former NC State College of Education Associate Dean Anona Smith Williams ’91MS, ’02EDD led the creation of what would later become the Leadership Institute for Future Teachers. In her own words, she describes how LIFT came to be, why it matters and what she hopes the next generation of LIFT participants take away from the program.
