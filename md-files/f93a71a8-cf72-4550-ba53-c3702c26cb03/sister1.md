#### How it Works

SAGE equips teenage entrepreneurs to build real businesses under the guidance of their teachers and mentors. The preparation for SAGE competitions, from local events to the prestigious SAGE World Cup, helps students refine their business models, develop real-world skills, and gain confidence. By working through the SAGE process, teens transform their initial ideas into impactful businesses, ready to compete on national and global stages.

* Entrepreneurial Beginnings:

Teens begin their journey by developing business solutions within their schools, clubs, or with the encouragement of their parents. They reach out to their local networks, including teachers, business leaders, and mentors, to refine their ideas and businesses and prepare for competition.

​

* National Stage:

Teams present their businesses at their country's national competition, representing their communities and showcasing the growth of their ventures. This stage is an opportunity for teens to further develop their strategies, improve their presentations, and gain recognition for their efforts.

​

* SAGE World Cup:

The top two teams from each country are invited to the annual SAGE World Cup. This global event allows students to present their businesses on an international stage, connect with industry leaders, and network with fellow teenage entrepreneurs from around the world. The World Cup combines competition with cultural exchange, fostering collaboration and inspiring the next generation of global leaders.

Through this process, SAGE participants gain invaluable experience, building both their businesses and the skills necessary to make lasting impacts on their communities and beyond.
