# High School Camps and Academies

Women in STEM (WiSTEM) on-campus summer camps and virtual academies provide **rising 10th through 12th-grade high school students** with the opportunity to explore STEM college majors and career paths, gain hands-on STEM experiences and STEM career skills, connect with STEM role models, and learn about university resources and the admissions process.

All students are invited to weekly [Role Model Monday Webinars](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/role-model-monday-webinars/) with STEM professionals throughout June and July. All students and families are invited to a virtual end-of-camp celebration and admissions presentation at the end of July.
