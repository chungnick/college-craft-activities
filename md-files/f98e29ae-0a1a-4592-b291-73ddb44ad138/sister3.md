# Undergraduate Programs

#### ***WiSTEM: Where Curiosity Meets Innovation!***

At WiSTEM, we’re not just about science, technology, engineering, and math—we’re about unleashing the power of curiosity. Imagine a vibrant community where inspired minds collide, where STEM leaders emerge with confidence and passion.

Our Mission: To ignite the spark in every student, regardless of gender, and propel them toward STEM greatness. From pre-college to undergraduates, we’re here to fuel your STEM journey.

## What can you get involved in?

* **[STEM Girl Day](http://www.girlday.utexas.edu)**: A day of wonder and discovery where young scientists explore, create, and dream. Undergraduate students can volunteer to lead hands-on activities, inspire young minds, and discover the joy of STEM outreach.
* **[WiSTEM Living Learning Community](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/living-learning-community/)**: Your first-year STEM community for inspiration, collaboration, and support. Connect with fellow STEM enthusiasts across campus and beyond.
* **[iConnect Events](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/iconnect/)**:Get connected to STEM role models, companies, and career paths while building confidence in your job search and networking skills.
* **[Externship](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/externship/)**:Gain credentialed accomplishments for your resume, talking points for interviews, confidence in your professional skills, and training/knowledge/learning to advance your STEM skillset.
* **[Outreach Ambassadors](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/outreach-ambassadors/)**: Hone your communication skills while leading campus and community STEM outreach. Excite the public and kids of all ages about STEM and experience the joy of curiosity and problem-solving.
* **[Role Model Monday Webinars](https://womeninstem.utexas.edu/role-model-monday-webinars/)**: Get inspired by the educational and career stories, successes, and struggles shared by STEM role models and UT Austin STEM alumni.

## Why WiSTEM?

* **Identity**: Discover your STEM self. We’re here to amplify your sense of belonging.
* **Self-Efficacy**: Believe in your abilities. We’ll provide the tools and encouragement.
* **Retention & Graduation**: Stay the course. We’re your compass, guiding you toward success.
* **Graduate School & Beyond**: Dream big. WiSTEM opens doors to limitless possibilities.

## Who can participate?

All Students Welcome: No matter your gender, background, or experience—join us! Let’s redefine what’s possible in STEM.

## What is the benefit?

Gain access to opportunities for mentoring, cross-discipline collaboration, community building, advancing leadership, living-learning communities, career exploration, professional skills development, and role model engagement.

WiSTEM undergraduate programs focus on strengthening STEM identity, creating a sense of belonging, and increasing self-efficacy for STEM undergraduate students. These three focus areas are directly linked to increased undergraduate retention/persistence, graduation rates, advancement to graduate school, and persistence in the STEM workforce.
