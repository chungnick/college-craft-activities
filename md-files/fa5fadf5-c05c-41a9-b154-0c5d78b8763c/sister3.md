**\*IDEA camps** are mission-driven camp sessions led by departments aiming to **Increase Diversity, Equity, & Access** in STEM majors and careers. These camps aim to support and empower traditionally excluded populations in STEM including (but not limited to) the areas of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and ability. The absence of their talents is a detriment to the STEM fields. IDEA camps provide a safe environment to build a community of peers and mentors who empower one another to be confident in their exploration of STEM. In alignment with our mission to foster a supportive environment for all members of our university community, this program is open to all eligible students regardless of race, color or national origin.All are welcome to apply.

Lab activities in LEAP Camp

The climate is a critical aspect of our everyday lives. The outdoor temperature and rainfall affect everything from clothing choices to crop yields. Understanding the current weather, forecasting future events, and studying the climate begin with gathering atmospheric data. Collecting and processing this data requires cross-disciplinary efforts from scientists and engineers.

Atmospheric data can be collected using small embedded systems deployed in the field. These embedded payloads contain small computers (microcontrollers) and numerous sensors. The sensors gather data, and microcontrollers handle simple processing. However, these weak microcontrollers are insufficient for problems that require complicated computations. Consequently, embedded systems typically transmit their data to a more powerful computer that can perform more complex analyses. These powerful computers are often hosted in the cloud.

This summer camp will teach you about electrical engineering and computer science. You will learn how individual components of an embedded system work and how to combine them to create a portable weather station. You will learn how your embedded system can communicate with powerful cloud computers and analyze your data with artificial intelligence algorithms. By the end of the camp, you will have a personal weather station you can deploy outside your home!

In this hands-on camp, you may explore topics related to

* Introductory programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and variables
* Soldering, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and hardware assembly
* Simple circuits and various sensors
* Cloud computing and data analysis
* Foundational concepts in artificial intelligence (AI)

## Testimonial

*“I love the freedom that we have, which is seen through the fact that we were able to work independently for large amounts of time. I also loved the social atmosphere and the other campers, and I enjoyed going out and exploring the campus and town with them.”* – 2024 LEAP Camper

*“You get to learn about your preferred major while having fun and socializing with others with the same interest as you”* – 2024 LEAP Camper

## Staff

**Aayushman Ghosh** is a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently in his second year. He’s researching exciting new materials that can bend and twist light in amazing ways. His goal is to use these materials to build 3D devices that control how light moves, helping pave the way for futuristic technology! Aayushman is passionate about teaching and enjoys making complex science fun and easy to understand for young audiences. With his experience mentoring undergraduate students, he’s excited to create a memorable summer camp experience.

**Chloe Armstrong** is a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research focuses on the design and fabrication of a special type of laser called a VCSEL. Many people encounter these tiny devices daily through the phone in their pocket! Coming from a family of educators, she is very passionate about making complicated science fun and accessible to the next generation of students. She is excited to apply her experiences as an undergraduate tutor and past LEAP camp assistant to make this year’s camp an unforgettable experience.
