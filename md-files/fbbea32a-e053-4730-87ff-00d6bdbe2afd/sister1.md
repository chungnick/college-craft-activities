# Programs Overview

The Office of Educational Programs works across the museum, the campus, and the city to develop a rich array of programs designed to engage the intellect and the imagination, serving university students and faculty, preK-12 students and teachers, and the larger Atlanta community. With the Carlos's collections and exhibitions at the center, the museum's expansive approach to programming emphasizes diverse voices, perspectives, and disciplines. It aims to connect the past and the present and to strengthen ties between the university and the community.
