# *UChicago Youth Internship Program*

#### Launched in 2021, the University of Chicago Youth Internship Program is a paid summer employment opportunity for Chicago public high school students. Over the course of two summers, program participants explore STEM careers, develop skills and experience applicable to college and the workforce, and prepare for the college application process.

## About

The Year 1 experience takes an earn and learn approach with career and college preparation through workshops, seminars, and activities. This includes a guest speaker series featuring a variety of STEM professionals, workplace tours, professional leadership lessons, college tours, and post-secondary planning.

The second summer, participants who successfully completed the Year 1 experience are eligible to reapply for a Year 2 internship, a six-week job in health sciences, computer sciences, or IT services within one of several University units.

YIP partners with One Summer Chicago, a citywide initiative through the Department of Family & Support Services’ Summer Youth Employment Program, which provides youth with employment and enrichment opportunities during the summer months.
