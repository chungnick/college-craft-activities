## Your Future in Health Care Starts Here

Picture yourself on your first day of med school, walking across a college quad, scrubs on, stethoscope in hand, surrounded by students who are just as excited about medicine as you are. That’s what a day at the **National Youth Leadership Forum (NYLF): Medicine & Health Care** program feels like.

This isn’t a camp—it’s a pre-college medical experience designed for high school students who are ready to go beyond the basics. Your mornings? You’ll roll up your sleeves and get hands-on, whether you're learning to suture or mastering the art of taking vitals. By afternoon, you’ll be tackling high-intensity simulations, jumping into trauma cases, and problem-solving health emergencies. And when it's time to step outside, you’ll tour a local medical simulation center and meet real-life health care professionals who’ve turned their passion into a career.

But the fun doesn’t stop there. Evenings are all about connecting with new friends and reflecting on the day’s adventures. You’ll collaborate on diagnostic challenges, hear from incredible surgeons, and just enjoy the thrill of it all.
