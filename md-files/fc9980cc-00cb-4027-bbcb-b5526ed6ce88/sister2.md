## Pre-College Summer Programs at Rice University

Rice University, in the heart of Houston, is ranked among the top 20 national universities and known for its 6:1 student-to-faculty ratio. Rice delivers an academically rich environment while maintaining a close-knit campus culture.

Located in the heart of Houston’s Museum District, students are immersed in a vibrant cultural landscape that complements their academic journey. The university’s strong legacy in science and engineering is underscored by notable alumni, including the nation’s first aerospace engineer. Iconic campus landmarks like Lovett Hall and the Sallyport archway provide a sense of tradition and belonging, while the tree-lined quads and Mediterranean-style architecture make it a truly one-of-a-kind place to learn and grow.
