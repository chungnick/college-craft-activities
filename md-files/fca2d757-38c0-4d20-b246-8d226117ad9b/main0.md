## Bienvenidos!

Welcome to the home of the *Aquetza: Youth, Leadership, Education and Community Empowerment Program* at CU Boulder hosted by UMAS y MEXA de CU Boulder, a summer enrichment experience for Colorado youth.

Aquetza is a free, residential and community-based summer program that provides high school students with strong ties to Chicano/Latino communities from across Colorado with an interactive, academic enrichment experience focused on engaging Chican@/Latin@ youth in examining the history, literature, health science, and relevant social and political issues surrounding their cultural communities, through rigorous academic work in ethnic studies, writing, reading, and science. Through our programming, attendees will have opportunities to see themselves as scholars – as holders and producers of new and valuable knowledge – as well as a chance to develop the skills to become leaders in their communities.
