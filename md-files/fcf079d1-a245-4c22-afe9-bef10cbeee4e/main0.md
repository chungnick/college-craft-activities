## The Oklahoma Science Training & Research Students Summer Research Program

---

### OKStars Program Information

The Oklahoma Science Training and Research program provides high school juniors and
seniors the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research. The summer program
includes in-depth work with a research team, access to modern instrumentation and
potential opportunities to participate in research presentations.

### Program Benefits for Participating Students

* As an OKStars student intern, you are immersed in a research atmosphere typically
  reserved for college students. You will work with a faculty mentor and be part of
  a research team working on an ongoing project.
* Student interns may work with a range of laboratory equipment in areas including chemical
  and biological analysis.
* Student interns may have the opportunity to present research at OSU in Tulsa's Research
  Day as well as the Joint Research Meeting alongside medical students and biomedical
  graduate students.
* Student interns have the opportunity to attend weekly lunch-and-learn sessions where
  you'll be given a presentation by a faculty member or staff member about important
  topics for students applying for college including writing a resume or CV, presenting
  scientific research, applying for scholarship opportunities, preparing to apply for
  college, and applying to medical school.
* Student interns make valuable connections with program faculty, staff, and graduate
  students who may act as mentors in the future.

### Program Details

The OKStars summer research program offers young students a unique opportunity - the
ability to experience biomedical research through hands-on learning while still in
high school. While this experience is educational and rewarding, it is a true commitment
to assist in furthering ongoing projects in the biomedical research labs at OSU-CHS.
Each student will be paired with another OKStars student while participating in the
program and aside from their lab partner, each student's research experience will
be different from students working in other labs campus.

Research projects such as those that OKStars students participate in take time, certain
experiments may take place over multiple days or weeks while others may conduct most
of their benchtop research one or two days per week. It is difficult to ask our participating
labs to work their research projects around a set schedule which is why, until a student
is offered a spot in the program at which point a schedule designed by the assigned
mentor will be provided, we advertise that students should be open to work on campus
up to 20 hours per week, similar to a part time job.

We understand that the students applying to this program are still in high school
and that their summer vacation is valuable time to relax and recharge, this is why
we have condensed the program to 6 weeks - to provide a month of free time for students
during their summer break. As of 2025, if students are offered a spot in the program,
they will receive a schedule agreed upon by their assigned mentor and they will be
asked to commit to the schedule provided. If a student does not disclose a scheduling
conflict before accepting a spot in the program it is grounds for dismissal.

OKStars is only possible through participation from our faculty, staff, and students
which is why a limited number of spots are available each summer.

We ask that students and parents be open to the experience provided during the program,
though students may experience a different type of research depending on their placement,
all the experiences provided during the program are beneficial and valuable.

### Program Dates

**Monday, June 1st, 2026 - Friday, July 10th, 2026**

### Student Commitment & Responsibilities

The OKStars summer research experience is extensive, and each scholar is expected
to:

* Commit to a schedule provided to offered students prior to program acceptance.
* Find and utilize a reliable mode of transportation to OSU Center for Health Sciences.
* Complete lab safety training provided by the program coordinator during orientation.
* Participate (*with parent or guardian*) in the pre-program virtual meeting.
* Attend weekly lunch and learn discussions, the details of which will be provided during
  orientation.
* Check email consistently during the program to encourage open-communication and to
  keep informed of any necessary updates.
