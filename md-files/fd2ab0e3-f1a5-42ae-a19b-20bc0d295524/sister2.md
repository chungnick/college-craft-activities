# Guide FOr the STUDENT

## 1

When your advisor wants you to start taking the tests, you will be sent email from HackerRank.com with a link to the short answer part of the test.  If you are in the Senior, Intermediate, or Junior divisions, you will receive a second email with a link to the programming part of the test. 

When you are ready, click on the green START TEST link in the email. The time won't start yet, so not to worry.  That link is custom to you.  Do not forward that link to a classmate; do not use a link that was forwarded to you.

## 2

The link takes you to the HackerRank platform.  The righthand side of the page has general instructions for using the HackerRank platform for the solving the ACSL problems. 

If you are not familiar with the HackerRank platform, you can take a [Sample Test](https://www.hackerrank.com/test/5qqdbqh3j95), which includes both multiple choice questions and a programming problem.

## 3

Eventually, you will get to the bottom of the righthand side where you'll either create a HackerRank account or login to your existing account.

## 4

Read and sign the declaration statement of honesty.  And then begin!!

HackerRank has developed sophisticated algorithms for detecting plagiarism in programming solutions.  Students found to be collaborating will score 0 points for that test.

## 5

After your test is submitted (we'll cover the specifics of the Short Problems and the Programming Problem below), you'll be prompted to rate the contest and provide feedback.  Neither is required, but we do appreciate your feedback.  Scores will appear on the ACSL Leaderboard within 2 hours.

## SHORT PROBLEMS

The screen on the left is a typical Short Problems test.  All questions are multiple choice.  For most divisions, there are 6 questions; in the Classroom division, there are 12 questions. When the time is up, your test is automatically submitted for scoring; you can submit it before the time is up using the Submit Test button.  Once you submit the exam, you will no longer have access to it or to your answers; your advisor will have a copy of the contest and solutions.

## PROGRAMMING PROBLEM

The HackerRank platform is a very rich programming environment, and we strongly suggest that you explore the environment with the Try Sample Test button in the initial page.  In any event, the HackerRank platform will guide you through its features the first time that you use it.

Each Programming Problem is structured with boilerplate code that handles input and output.  Your job will be to complete a function with specified parameters, and return a value in the correct format.

There will be up to 12 test cases to test your program.  The last 6 are "hidden", in that you are not shown the answers.  Each correct answer in the hidden set is worth one point.  You may run the program as many times as you'd like.  

When the time is up, the last time you ran your program will be your score.  You can submit it before the time is up using the Submit Test button.  Once you submit the exam, you will no longer have access to it or to your answers; your advisor will have a copy of the problem and test data. 

All submitted programs become the property of ACSL and may be used in the materials it produces.
