* ## Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences "Keller BLOOM Program" Application

  Program Dates: May 17th - 22nd 2026
* **Background**

  The Keller BLOOM (Bigelow Laboratory Orders of Magnitude) Program provides students the opportunity to participate in marine science research with Bigelow Laboratory scientists. Activities include field sampling on a daylong research cruise, experiments and analysis using state-of-the-art instrumentation, and a presentation by students of their discoveries. Students also participate in formal and informal discussions on topics such as public policy and scientific ethics and attend a Marine Science Career Night, where they learn about undergraduate marine science programs in Maine, and related career possibilities. Students who participate in BLOOM will leave with a better understanding of marine science and be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue a career in science.

  Sixteen students are selected to participate. The Laboratory provides room and board – BLOOM participants live in dormitory housing on campus with chaperones and all meals are provided. **There is no cost to participate in the program.**

  **Selection Criteria**

  Applications will be evaluated based upon level of interest and communications skills as evidenced by your written application, and two letters of recommendation.
