The Bruin Ascent Summer Experience (BASE) provides high-achieving California high school students from economically under–resourced communities with the tools, support, and knowledge needed to confidently navigate the complexities of higher education. This **online scholarship program** will offer students the chance to **earn** **college credit**, access valuable **mentorship from current UCLA students**, and participate in **co-curricular workshops** that will enrich their academic and personal development. By the end of their time in BASE, students will have a well-rounded foundation to successfully prepare them for their future academic endeavors!

Have questions? Watch the **[recording](https://ucla.box.com/s/eqlda4z411xm6talmeiwwgxfyrgv1mhn)** of our informational webinar.

## BASE Overview

### Program Details

BASE is a six-week needs- and merit-based **online** scholarship program that provides recipients with the opportunity to gain UCLA college credit by enrolling in one UCLA summer online course **free of charge**. In addition to this academic component, BASE students virtually meet with a UCLA student mentor and attend co-curricular workshops that will not only help them prepare for their higher education endeavors, but thrive in them.

To accomplish this, BASE provides in-depth support across four key areas:

1. **College Advising** 
   * Students are provided with quality college advising and various workshops that guide them through the intricacies of the college admissions process, including how to select “best fit” colleges.  Students gain the skills to effectively showcase their qualifications on their college application and to strategically plan their academic journey to ultimately prepare them for their future career.
2. **Academic Preparation & Support**
   * Through enrollment in a UCLA summer online course, students are exposed to rigorous college coursework and can gain college credit. Coupled with academic support, such as office hours and practical study skill workshops, students learn how to successfully navigate the hidden curriculum of higher education and how to manage the challenges of college academic course loads.
3. **Social-Emotional Support**
   * Students will join a supportive community by building connections with UCLA college students, faculty, and staff. Through mentorship pairings with a UCLA student for one-on-one support, inclusive student panels, and informative webinars on college life, BASE aims to foster a network that shares knowledge, offers valuable advice, and provides unwavering support for the college experience.
4. **Financial Support**
   * Financial barriers are removed by offering this summer experience at no additional cost. Additionally, students are equipped with the necessary tools to make informed financial decisions in their pursuit of their educational goals through targeted workshops on financial wellness, FAFSA, and independently researching scholarships.

Participating in BASE will require you to commit a minimum of 7-10 hours a week, with additional time required for studying/homework. Please keep in mind that BASE is a college-level program with a rigorous academic component and engaging co-curricular activities that require your full dedication. We strongly encourage you to carefully evaluate your summer schedule and apply only if you can fully commit the time and attention needed to succeed in the program.

### Academic Support

Adjusting to college-level coursework requires reflecting on study habits and learning strategies, as well as utilizing the diverse academic support resources available at colleges. The BASE program is designed to support you in your online summer course, while empowering you to proactively take charge of your academic journey by developing the necessary skills to navigate and leverage the resources available to support your success. Listed below are  various academic support resources that will be available throughout the program:

* **Study Skills Workshops**  
  Presentation topics will include effective note-taking strategies, exam preparation, active reading techniques, time-management, and more!
* **Peer Study Groups**  
  You will have the opportunity to connect and collaborate with your peers enrolled in the same course. Additionally, virtual study sessions will be organized throughout the program.
* **Mentorship with current UCLA students**  
  Your mentors will be available to check in with you about your experience in the course, share insights from their own academic challenges and how they overcame them, and offer guidance on your coursework. While we will make every effort to match you with a mentor whose academic background aligns with your summer course, please note we cannot guarantee they will be able to provide direct assistance with course material.
* **Resource Guide**  
  At the start of the program, students will be given a resource guide that includes various academic support services available to them as an enrolled student at UCLA.
* **Office Hours with Program Staff & Instructors**  
  Weekly office hours will be available, providing an opportunity for you to virtually meet with your instructor or the BASE coordinator outside of class lectures. By the end of the program, you will have gained valuable skills in effectively utilizing office hours and applying best practices for reaching out to instructors for additional support.

## Mentorship

The academic journey goes beyond the classroom and includes creating a community of support. BASE students will be paired with passionate and knowledgeable UCLA undergraduate student mentors. During their time in the program, students will receive valuable advice, share insights, and learn how to navigate the college experience with confidence, while being integrated into a network committed to their success!

## Connect with a UCLA Student!

### Mentorship Pairing

The mentors are current UCLA undergraduate students, representing a diverse range of backgrounds and academic majors. While we aim to match you with a mentor whose academic background aligns with your summer course, we cannot guarantee they will be able to provide direct assistance with course material. However, your mentor will serve as an invaluable resource, offering not only academic guidance but also a unique opportunity to hear firsthand accounts of the college experience from a student’s perspective. They will provide a supportive space to ask questions, discuss concerns, and navigate any fears you may have about college life.

Students will meet with their mentors for a minimum of one hour each week at a designated time. While mentors will bring pre-planned material to guide discussions, you are encouraged to come prepared with your own questions and topics to ensure the meetings address your specific needs and interests. By the end of the BASE program, we hope you will have openly shared your thoughts, challenges, and aspirations, forging a meaningful connection with your mentor that extends beyond the summer!

## Co-Curriculars

Preparing for college, both academically and socially, can be overwhelming and daunting. BASE co-curriculars are meant to help students feel confident in adjusting to any challenges they may face in their journeys to higher education. The program includes a combination of  workshops that provide college advising, academic & social-emotional skill sets, and financial education. Please review the sections below for a look at some of the topics covered in the co-curriculars.

## Workshops, Panels, and More!

In tandem with your weekly mentorship meetings, the co-curriculars will follow a specific theme each week, seen in the below calendar. Additionally, you can find a calendar with the co-curricular workshops we offered in 2025. **Please note these co-curricular topics are subject to change. The 2026 programming calendar will be updated in the Spring.**

### College Advising

Applying for college can feel overwhelming, with countless options to consider and lengthy applications to complete.

### Social-Emotional Wellness

The college experience goes beyond earning a degree; it’s also an opportunity to explore a new environment and connect with diverse communities. Balancing your mental and physical health, building strong support systems, and cultivating a sense of belonging are essential for thriving both academically and personally in your future college journey. The below workshops delve into these areas, while highlighting potential resources you can seek out:

* **UCLA Student Q&A Panel**

## FAQs

### Will there be any expenses/fees I will be expected to cover?

The entire program will be free of charge, with UCLA Summer Sessions covering course tuition fees and the cost of course materials/textbooks.

### How does BASE differ from Summer Scholars Support?

BASE is a comprehensive scholarship program that is only open to current California 10th and 11th grade students. It is completely online, with all BASE students enrolling in one online summer course and attending online co-curricular programming. Additionally, BASE will pair recipients with a UCLA undergraduate student mentor, which is not an opportunity offered in any other UCLA Summer Sessions program.

Summer Scholars Support is not its own program, but instead a standalone scholarship fund that can be used to apply to any of the following UCLA Summer Sessions offerings: Summer Courses, Summer Online, Summer Intensives, Summer Precollege Focus Series, or SCIP. Modality (in-person or online) as well as access to co-curriculars will depend on the UCLA Summer Sessions program the recipients choose to participate in. 9th graders are also eligible to apply for Summer Scholars Support, but not BASE.

### What is the overall time commitment for BASE? Can I have other summer plans as well?

Participating in BASE will require you to commit a minimum of 7-10 hours a week, with additional time required for studying/homework.

* All approved courses will have 4-6 hours of required lecture a week
* Meeting with your UCLA undergraduate mentor and participating in BASE co-curricular programming will be an additional 3-4 hours a week

While it is very possible to have other summer obligations, please keep in mind that BASE is a college-level program with a rigorous academic component and engaging co-curricular activities that require your full dedication. We strongly encourage you to carefully evaluate your summer schedule and apply only if you can fully commit the time and attention needed to succeed in the program.

### What will happen if I need to miss class and/or other BASE programming?

Summer classes are regular 10-week UCLA courses compressed into 6 weeks at an accelerated pace. Therefore, missing any portion of the course would leave you at a great disadvantage and you should do your best to ensure there are no conflicts, such as family vacations or other obligations. If you must miss any portion of the course, you should consult with the instructor to determine if you will be able to make-up any material or assignments missed. While a majority of UCLA courses do not take attendance, missing large portions of the course may make it very difficult to pass the course and the opportunity to make-up missed work will be at the instructor’s discretion.  

BASE co-curricular programming and mentorship are integral parts of this program and you are expected to commit 2-4 hours a week for these additional programming components. If you must miss any BASE programming, you will be required to notify UCLA Summer Sessions staff accordingly and complete a make-up assignment. **Continued tardiness or absences for BASE co-curricular programming can result in the student being asked to leave the program.**

### Is attending co-curricular programming mandatory?

Yes, attending co-curricular programming is mandatory and will be an expected 2-3 hour time commitment a week throughout the duration of BASE.

### What if I do not have access to a laptop/computer?

A laptop/computer is required in order to attend your online course and co-curricular programming.

If you do not have reliable access to a laptop/computer, UCLA Summer Sessions encourages you to still apply to BASE! On the application, you will be able to indicate if you do or do not have access to a laptop/computer. If selected as a recipient, our office will contact you directly to coordinate a solution in order for you to participate.

### Are there any exceptions to the GPA requirement?

The GPA requirement of 3.5 (unweighted) is strict. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please email [confidential@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:confidential@summer.ucla.edu).

### Are there any exceptions to the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) requirement?

The household Adjusted Gross income (AGI) requirement is strict, with the threshold limits coming from the California Department of Housing and Community Development’s annual [State Income Limits report](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/income-limits-2025.pdf). If you have any further questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please email [confidential@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:confidential@summer.ucla.edu).

### What if my parent(s)/guardian(s) do not have a 1040 tax form?

If your parent(s)/guardian(s) do not have a 1040 tax form available, we will still require some form of documentation confirming financial need and household income. Please email [confidential@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:confidential@summer.ucla.edu) for more information regarding acceptable alternative documentation.

### Even though the letter of recommendation is optional, will it hurt my chances of being selected if I do not submit one?

It will NOT hurt your application and your chance of being selected if you choose to not submit a letter of recommendation.

### Will I be able to access my application and make changes to it after the initial submission?

You will NOT be able to re-access your application and make changes to it after submission. Therefore, please ensure all components of the application are filled out correctly and the proper documents are uploaded before submitting.

### Can I take a course not on the approved list of courses for BASE?

The approved course list for BASE is strict and students will NOT be able to enroll in any other online courses offered.

### Will I be able to change my enrolled course at a later date if I change my mind?

Yes, you can request to change to a different approved course as long as the request is submitted by **Friday, June 12** AND there is still space available in the course you are hoping to switch into.

### How much work will be expected of me outside of the class lecture? Will there be homework?

You will be enrolling into college-level courses that are offered at UCLA during the regular school year and earning college credit. Every course will require homework and/or dedicated time to prepare for lecture outside of class.

### Will the college credit I earn at UCLA transfer to another college/university?

Most colleges/universities accept UCLA credit for transfer. Students who attend a university outside of the UC system should verify their school’s credit-granting process. Transfer of credit is at the discretion of the receiving institution.

Students who attend a University of California (UC) school in the future are guaranteed their UCLA credit will transfer. You may visit the [Enrollment and Academics page](https://summer.ucla.edu/student-services/enrollment-and-academics/) and view more information under the “University Credit, Grades, and Transcripts” section.

### If I live close to UCLA, can I choose to take an in-person course and/or meet with my mentor in-person?

BASE is a completely online program. As a result, BASE students will only be able to enroll in the approved list of online courses and meet with their mentor at their designated online meeting time.

### Will participating in BASE strengthen my chances of being accepted to UCLA?

Being selected to participate in BASE does not have any bearing on future admission to UCLA or any other University of California campus. With that being said, participating in a college-level program such as BASE will prepare students for success in their future academic careers at any leading college or university around the world and can strengthen their overall college application.
