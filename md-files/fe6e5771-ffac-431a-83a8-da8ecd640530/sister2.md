## General Inquiries

### MyUCLA

### What is MyUCLA?

[MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/) is UCLA’s integrated portal from which students, as well as faculty, can access a variety of UCLA online resources. It enables students to enroll in courses, check grades, pay bills, update their information, order transcripts, plan their calendars, among many other functions. You can visit the comprehensive list of [MyUCLA features](https://my.ucla.edu/features/) for more details.

Please view the [MyUCLA Setting](https://youtu.be/BHD2JQgns24) and [MyUCLA Features](https://youtu.be/1uDXbbkUJ1g) tutorials.

### Can I give someone else access to my records via MyUCLA?

Yes, students can authorize a third party (e.g. parent/guardian) view-only access to student records and direct access to pay summer charges on BruinBill.

Under the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), any student attending a higher education institution is entitled to certain privacy rights as stipulated under FERPA. For this reason, a student must first provide a third-party consent to access student information (e.g., enrollment, billing, or payment information via BruinBill).

To set up access, the third party must first create their own MyUCLA logon and password. The student will then give access to their third party on MyUCLA in “Settings” and then “Third Party Access.” To grant access, students must know the third-party’s UCLA logon ID, first name, and last name. Access can be edited or revoked at any time via MyUCLA.

### Holds

### Why was the Summer Sessions Financial Hold placed on my account?

The Summer Sessions Financial Hold is placed due to an outstanding Summer balance to ensure full payment is made. It restricts enrollment actions and access to campus services, grades, and diploma.  

Once the Summer balance is paid in full via BruinBill, the Summer Sessions Financial Hold will automatically be removed.  It is the student’s responsibility to reach out to the listed office to resolve the hold or request it be temporarily lifted to make enrollment changes. Requests to temporarily lift a Summer Financial hold may be approved on a discretionary basis in order for students to make enrollment changes; the temporary lift is intended to be a one-time courtesy and excessive requests will not be approved.

### I need to make enrollment changes but have a hold on my account. How do I proceed?

**Summer Courses**

If you have a hold(s) on your account preventing enrollment actions, you may complete the [Student Update Form](https://r.summer.ucla.edu/pdf/StudentUpdateFormInteractive.pdf) and submit it to [info@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:info@summer.ucla.edu).  

**Enrollment Changes for Other Terms**

Our office can temporarily lift the Summer Sessions Financial Hold for 2-3 days to allow for enrollment changes via MyUCLA.  Requests to temporarily lift a Summer Financial hold may be approved on a discretionary basis in order for students to make enrollment changes; the temporary lift is intended to be a one-time courtesy and excessive requests will not be approved.

To request a temporarily lift, please reach out to our office via email at [info@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:info@summer.ucla.edu) and include your nine-digit University ID Number (UID).

It is the student’s responsibility to reach out to the listed office to resolve the hold or request it be temporarily lifted to make enrollment changes. If you have a hold from another UCLA office, reach out to that office directly.

### Financial Aid

### Is financial aid available for Summer Sessions?

**UCLA Students** 

Financial aid is available to eligible UCLA students including students admitted to UCLA for fall quarter. To find out if you qualify for financial aid, and to learn more about aid eligibility and calculate your potential award amount, please visit the [Financial Aid website.](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/special-aid-programs/summer-aid)

**Visiting UC Students** 

Eligible financial aid students from other University of California (UC) campuses may apply for financial aid at their home UC campus for summer study at UCLA. Please check your home UC campus financial aid website. 

Note: If you plan to pay for classes with financial aid from your home institution, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your home institution, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines.

**High School Students**

A limited number of full and partial need- and merit-based scholarships are available to qualified California\* high school students for summer study at UCLA. Visit our [***Summer Scholars Support page***](https://summer.ucla.edu/student-types/high-school-students/scholarships/) for more information.

\**UCLA financial aid is not available to visiting out-of-state high school students*.

Note: If you plan to pay for classes with financial aid from your home institution, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your home institution, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines.

**Visiting Adult Students from the U.S.**

Financial aid is not available through UCLA for this population. Please check with your home institution, if applicable, for potential financial aid options. 

If you plan to pay for classes with financial aid from your home institution, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your home institution, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines and your course(s) may be dropped if payment is not received on time.

Note: If you plan to pay for classes with third party financial aid, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your sponsor, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines.

**International Students**

UCLA financial aid is not available to visiting international students. Funding options may be available to you from private or governmental agencies in your home country. For information on funding your studies in the United States, please visit your local [EducationUSA](https://www.educationusa.state.gov) Office or visit their website.

### I’m a UCLA financial aid student. What are the requirements to maintain financial aid eligibility?

Unit minimums may differ depending on the type of aid students are receiving. Please see the “Maintaining Summer Aid Eligibility” section of [Financial Aid’s website.](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/special-aid-programs/summer-aid) 

Please contact the UCLA ***[Financial Aid Office](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/contact-us)*** for specific questions.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: The UCLA Financial Aid Office will review your MyUCLA StudyList at the end of the third week of each session to verify final eligibility for summer aid. You may submit an Enrollment Change Request Form on MyUCLA should you need to update your unit amount. Students who are not enrolled in the number of units they had indicated on their application may have aid reduced and/or may be required to return aid funding.*

### I am receiving aid from a third party sponsor. How can I have my aid applied to my UCLA Summer Sessions bill?

During the summer, if a student is receiving a scholarship or sponsorship from a non-UCLA-affiliated third-party, the sponsor will complete the steps required by the Student Accounts Office, found on their [website](https://www.finance.ucla.edu/thirdpartysponsors). 

These requests are managed by Student Accounts, not Summer Sessions. If you have any questions or need to direct the student to someone from Student Accounts that manages third-party sponsors, you may use the email address [**thirdpartysponsor@finance.ucla.edu**](mailto:thirdpartysponsor@finance.ucla.edu). 

Note: If you plan to pay for classes with third party financial aid, you assume full responsibility for all fees. Regardless of when you receive financial aid from your sponsor, you are held to the UCLA Summer Sessions payment deadlines.

### Fees, Payment, and Refunds

### Am I assessed a fee for withdrawing from Summer Sessions?

**UCLA Students** 

Starting April 15, a non-refundable processing fee of $175 will be assessed on BruinBill if all summer courses are dropped and the student takes 0 units of the summer term. If a student drops all classes prior to April 15, or re-enrolls and does complete summer courses, **no** fee will be assessed.

**Visiting Students** (including dismissed/withdrawn UCLA students, or UCLA students who have graduated prior to the summer term)

The $350 registration fee ($175 for UC students) is non-refundable at all times, even if you drop all courses before they begin.

### How can I pay for my courses or summer program?

Acceptable payment methods on  [***MyUCLA***](https://my.ucla.edu/)  include credit card\*, electronic-check (e-check), and foreign payment, such as Travelex. To submit payment online, sign in to your [***MyUCLA***](https://my.ucla.edu/) account, select “Finances and Jobs,” then “BruinBill.”

To pay by paper check, you may mail your check to the address below. Please make the check payable to “UC Regents,” include your nine-digit University ID (UID) number, and write the word “Summer” on the memo line. We highly encourage **those paying by mail to submit payment at least two weeks prior to the payment deadline** to ensure payment is received on time.

### I am an international student. Can I make a payment with a foreign currency?

Yes, please see the International Payment Methods section of the [BruinBill Payment Methods Guide](https://www.finance.ucla.edu/business-finance-services/payment-solutions-and-compliance/bruinbill-payment-methods#:~:text=a%20new%20window.-,(Sign%20in%20%2D%3E%20Finances%20and%20Jobs%20%2D%3E%20BruinBill%20%2D,and%20American%20Express%20online%20payments.).

Please note that there can be long processing times (1-2 weeks) for payments made through international vendors such as Flywire and Alipay. **It is highly recommended that international payments are made at least 2 weeks prior to the payment deadline to ensure that payments are processed.** If the payment is not received/posted to BruinBill by the payment deadline, the student will be dropped for nonpayment.

### What is the Instructional Enhancement Initiative (IEI) Fee?

The Instructional Enhancement Initiative (IEI) Fee is a course materials fee that is assessed for all students who have not yet received a Bachelor’s Degree. The fee helps support the use of technology at UCLA for educational purposes, and cannot be waived. 

For more information, please visit the [***Instructional Enhancement Initiative website***](http://www.iei.ucla.edu/).

### What is the Document Fee?

The Document Fee covers: 

* Lifetime official transcripts—mailed by USPS first class mail
* Unlimited removal of incomplete petitions—removal of incomplete grades from a transcript
* Lifetime verification mailings— mailed by USPS first class mail
* Initial diploma mailed to a U.S. or international address

Services not covered by the Document Fee are still subject to transaction fees. These include, but are not limited to: 

* Express shipping
* Special handling
* Replacement diplomas
* Notary services

Students and alumni must clear all appropriate campus blocks/holds on their account before obtaining transcript or diploma services. For more information, please contact the [Registrar’s Office](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Contacts-Hours).

### I am a UCLA staff member. Do I qualify for a staff discount?

UCLA and ASUCLA staff employees who enroll in summer classes or a summer program with UCLA Summer Sessions are eligible for a discount if they meet the following criteria: 

1. Employed by UCLA for the previous six months
2. Career appointment of at least 50% time or a casual appointment of 100% time
3. Not a continuing or admitted University of California (UC) undergraduate or graduate student

The discount reduces summer fees by $350. UCLA and ASUCLA staff employees must pay the remaining summer fees at the non-UC student rate. 

To apply for a staff discount, complete the online [registration form](https://summer.ucla.edu/registration/) and make payment of the $350 registration fee, then email [info@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:info@summer.ucla.edu) with your nine-digit staff ID number indicating you are requesting verification of your eligibility. After we verify if you qualify for the staff discount, we will apply the discount to your account.

*Please note that staff members who are continuing or admitted UC undergraduate or graduate students are NOT eligible for a discount. Summer Sessions fees for continuing or admitted UC students are automatically assessed at the lower UC student rate.*

### Transcripts and College Credit

### Will the units I earn at UCLA transfer to another college or university?

Students outside the UC system should verify their school’s credit-granting process before enrollment. Transfer of credit is at the discretion of the receiving institution.

For students from other UC campuses, all UCLA summer activity automatically appears on their home UC campus transcript by mid-November\*, and the grades they earn at UCLA are included in your home UC campus grade-point average.

*\*If a UC student requires their transcript earlier than mid-November, they may order their transcript on MyUCLA under the “Classes” tab and then “Grades and Transcripts.”*

### How do I order my UCLA transcript?

[UCLA transcripts](https://registrar.ucla.edu/student-records/academic-transcript/order-an-academic-transcript) can be ordered on MyUCLA once grades are posted 10 days after the last day of class. We do not send individual transcripts to specific schools; they must be ordered through MyUCLA with the following steps: 

1. Login to [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/)
2. Select the “Classes” tab at the top
3. Select “Transcript – Official”
4. Select “Order an Official Transcript”
5. Click on the selection to expand it
6. Input the schools for it to be sent to

You may also download an unofficial transcript, if needed. If you are experiencing issues logging in to your MyUCLA account, please try [resetting your password](https://accounts.iam.ucla.edu/security/reset) or contacting the UCLA [IT Support Center](https://www.it.ucla.edu/it-support-center/contact-us) for MyUCLA assistance at 310-267-4357 or [help@it.ucla.edu](mailto:help@it.ucla.edu). 

Please contact the UCLA Registrar’s Office at [transcripts@registrar.ucla.edu](mailto:transcripts@registrar.ucla.edu) for any specific transcript related questions or concerns.

### Will taking UCLA courses in the summer help me get into UCLA or the UC system?

High school students and potential transfer students who take college-level courses at UCLA will certainly make their application for UCLA and other UC schools more competitive, however, attending UCLA Summer Sessions does not give you an advantage for being accepted to a UC school.

## Summer Courses, Summer Online, and Summer Intensives

### Course Dates and Length

### How long are Summer Courses?

For Summer Courses, Summer Online, and Summer Intensives, UCLA Summer Sessions offers students the chance to select between nine different sessions ranging in length from 3-10 weeks. Each opportunity is full of academic opportunities for you to make progress toward graduation.

Each Session has a letter and a number. The letter indicates the start date: A (June 23), B (July 14), C (August 4). The number indicates the length of the course in weeks.

Below are the 2026 session dates:

Session A3           June 22, 2026                     July 10, 2026

### Eligibility and Registration Requirements

### What are the requirements to participate in Summer Courses?

Students must be 15 years of age or older by June 22, 2026 to participate in Summer Courses, Summer Online, or Summer Intensives. You are not required to be enrolled in an academic institution to participate in UCLA Summer Sessions.

### Do I need to submit my transcript or SAT scores to participate in UCLA Summer Sessions?

No. UCLA has an open enrollment policy for summer classes; therefore, UCLA does not require a copy of your transcript or standardized test scores to participate in Summer Courses, Summer Online, or Summer Intensives. All registration and enrollment directions can be found [here](https://summer.ucla.edu/student-services/enrollment-and-academics/).

### I am an international student. Do I need to submit my TOEFL scores to participate in Summer Courses?

International students who want to take summer courses instructed in English must demonstrate proficiency in English if from a non-English speaking country. Please visit the [***International Student page***](https://summer.ucla.edu/international-student-info/) and view the “English Proficiency” section for information on how to satisfy this requirement.

International students who will only take English as a Second Language (ESL) courses during the summer, however, are not required to provide proof of English proficiency.

### Are there any Summer Courses that visiting students cannot take?

Although the majority of Summer Courses are open to visiting students, a select few are restricted to “UCLA students only.”

To view course restrictions, visit the [***Schedule of Classes***](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc), search for your desired course, then click on the symbol under “Info” to view any applicable restrictions.

### The course I want to take has a prerequisite and/or course restriction. Can I take it?

**UCLA Students**

Current UCLA students must have completed any and all requisite courses before the start of the summer term. If you plan on taking the requisite course(s) during the winter or spring quarter prior to summer, you may enroll by contacting the department offering the course.

**Visiting Students**

If you have experience comparable to the listed requisite, you may enroll. Transcripts or proof of completion of a requisite course(s) is **not** required for visiting students.

Please visit the [***Schedule of Classes***](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc) for a full course description. You can view course requisites and restrictions by clicking “Lec,” “TUT,” or “SEM” for individual courses.

### Registration and Enrollment

### How many classes can I take during the summer?

**UCLA Students**

UCLA College of Letters and Science students and graduate students may enroll in up to 18 units per summer.

UCLA students who want to enroll in more units must obtain approval from their school or college. Please view the list of [UCLA College and School Advising Offices](http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Academics/Academic-Counseling) to learn more.

**Non-UCLA Students**

**High School Students**

High school students may not exceed 10 units per session\* (approximately two courses). High school students must petition to take more than two courses or to exceed 10 units. Contact [petition@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:petition@summer.ucla.edu) for more information.

*\*Language Intensive courses on the list of approved courses for high school students exceed 10 units but are permissible for high school students without the need to complete a petition.*

### How can I register and enroll in Summer Courses?

**UCLA Students**

Current UCLA students may enroll directly on MyUCLA starting February 1.

**Non-UCLA Students**

Please follow the instructions on our [enrollment page](https://summer.ucla.edu/student-services/enrollment-and-academics/).

Non-UCLA students can register by submitting a [Summer Course Registration Form](https://r.summer.ucla.edu/academiccourses/register.cfm). Once you complete the registration form and pay the non-refundable registration fee, you will receive an email with your nine-digit UCLA University ID number (UID). Follow the emailed instructions to create your MyUCLA account where you can enroll under the “Classes” tab, view your Study List, pay your charges under “Finances and Jobs” on BruinBill, and order transcripts after your session has concluded.

### When is the deadline to enroll in Summer Courses?

Students may enroll in Summer Courses through Friday of Week 1 of the course (5PM PDT).

Beginning Week 2, a student may enroll only with the instructor’s consent, either with a Permission to Enroll (PTE) number or an authorized signature on a [Student Update Form](https://r.summer.ucla.edu/pdf/StudentUpdateFormInteractive.pdf), which can be emailed to [info@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:info@summer.ucla.edu).

### Can I enroll in multiple Summer Courses?

Yes, students may enroll in more than one Summer Course as long as they abide by the following guidelines:

* There are no overlapping meeting times in your Summer Courses or programs
* High school students can only enroll in up to two courses (10 units total) per summer
* Visiting non-UCLA students can only enroll in up to 18 units per summer
* UCLA College of Letters and Science and graduate students may enroll in up to 18 units per summer, all other undergraduate UCLA students from the following colleges or schools may enroll in up to 16 units per summer:

* + School of Arts and Architecture
  + Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science
  + Herb Alpert School of Music
  + Meyer and Renee Luskin School of Public Affairs
  + School of Nursing
  + School of Theater, Film, and Television

UCLA undergraduate students wishing to enroll in more units than their pre-determined unit maximums must obtain approval from their school or college advising unit via petition.

### What is the Study List?

The Study List on [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/) records all classes in which a student is enrolled in for a term. The grading basis for each enrolled class is listed on the study list.

**Students should check their Study List after all enrollment** **transactions.** Students cannot receive credit for classes that are not shown on their Study List.

### The Summer Course I want to take currently has a waitlist. How does the waitlist work?

If a Summer Course is at capacity and has an active waitlist, you may place yourself on the waitlist on [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu). If an enrolled student or a student ahead of you on the waitlist drops the course, you will automatically be moved up on the waitlist. If you are the first person on the waitlist and space becomes available in the course, you will automatically be enrolled\*.

\**You will not be notified if you are moved from the waitlist into the course; therefore, it is your responsibility to check your enrollment status periodically on* [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/)*.*

*If you do not receive a space in the course from the waitlist by Friday of Week 1 (5pM PDT), you will automatically be dropped from the waitlist and will receive a full refund for the course.*

### What does a “Closed” course mean?

If a course is “Closed,” enrollment in that course is filled to capacity. The department or instructor offering the class may allow individual students to enroll using a Permission to Enroll (PTE) number. Please contact the instructor or department directly.

### Can I audit a course?

No. Unfortunately, we do not allow auditing during the summer. Due to the high demand for courses from UCLA and visiting students, we have to limit participation to enrolled students only.

### I paid the registration fee and created a MyUCLA account. Why don’t I see the registration fee payment on Bruin Bill?

The non-refundable registration fee paid at the beginning of the registration process ($175 for UC students and $350 for non-UC visiting students) can take up to 3 business days to post to Bruin Bill.

Please verify that it has been posted to your account before making additional payments to avoid overpayment.

If making payment prior to the registration fee posting to Bruin Bill (and at least 1 week prior to the payment deadline), you can pay the total minus the registration fee amount while this registration payment is pending.

### Summer Online

### Do I ever have to come to campus for an online course?

If the [Schedule of Classes](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc) lists the building as “ONLINE,” the course will be completed entirely online and you will not need to come to campus for the entirety of the session or the final.

If the course has a lecture or discussion with a building and room number listed, you will need to come to campus for that portion of the course. These courses are considered “hybrid” with some portions online and others on campus.

### Do I have to log into my online course on a specific day or time?

If the course schedule indicates a specific time for the lecture and/or discussion, it is synchronous and you will need to attend the course at that specified time.

If the course does not list a day or time, it is asynchronous and can be taken at your leisure within the session dates as long as assignments and examinations are completed on time.

### Attendance and Academic Difficulty

### I’ll be on vacation for a week of the session. Can I make up for what I’ve missed?

No. Summer classes are regular 10-week UCLA courses compressed into a shorter session length at an accelerated pace; therefore, missing any portion of the course will put you at a great disadvantage. It is crucial to attend all of the course meetings.

### Withdrawal and Cancellation Policy

### What are my options if I no longer want to take the course I’ve selected?

You may drop summer classes on [***MyUCLA***](https://my.ucla.edu/) and receive a refund of course fees if the course(s) is dropped BEFORE the refund deadline:

* [**Impacted Courses**](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC/Search/ImpactedCoursesMasterList) **and Summer Intensives:** Friday, Week 1 of the course (by 5PM PDT)
* **Non-Impacted Courses**: Friday, Week 2 of the course (by 5PM PDT)

Note: The $350 registration fee is ***non-refundable*** at all times ($175 for UC students who drop all classes starting April 15 and ultimately take 0 units for the summer term).

After the refund deadline, students may still drop a course *without* a refund through the following deadlines:

* [**Impacted Courses**](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC/Search/ImpactedCoursesMasterList): Friday, Week 1 of the course (by 5PM PDT)
* **Non-Impacted Courses**: Last day of the class (by 5PM PDT)

***\*A student may not drop a course if the final exam, paper, or project was attempted or submitted.***

### What is the refund policy for Summer Courses?

**Non-Refundable Fees**

*UCLA Students* – Starting April 15, if you drop all of the Summer Session classes you have enrolled in, a **$175 processing fee** will appear on your BruinBill account **for dropping to 0 units**. This fee is non-refundable, and the total refund amount will reflect this fee. If you enroll in a course(s) after the processing fee is assessed, it will automatically be removed. Dropping prior to April 15 will not incur a fee.

*Visiting Students (including dismissed/withdrawn UCLA students)* – A $350 registration fee ($175 for UC students) is required for visiting students to enroll in Summer Sessions. This fee is applied to your BruinBill account and is non-refundable under any circumstance once paid.

In the event of withdrawal before the deadline, the total refund amount will reflect this fee on the BruinBill account.

**Refundable Fees**

In the event of withdrawal, the course fee, IEI Fee, Registration Fee, document fee, and/or Material Use Fee is refundable if the course(s) is dropped before the deadlines below at 5PM (PDT):

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Session** | [**Impacted Courses**](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC/Search/ImpactedCoursesMasterList) | **Non-Impacted Courses** |
| Session A3 | June 26, 2026 | June 26, 2026 |
| Session A6, A8, A9, A10 | June 26, 2026 | July 3, 2026 |
| Session B3 | July 17, 2026 | July 17, 2026 |
| Session C3 | August 7, 2026 | August 7, 2026 |
| Session C6 | August 7, 2026 | August 14, 2026 |

These fees are 100% NON-refundable after the deadlines above and students are financially liable for all fees if withdrawal occurs beyond those deadlines.

### My class has been cancelled by the department. Will I receive a refund?

Yes, if your class has been cancelled by the department, you will be refunded the course fees. If you are not enrolled in any other classes, and do not plan to enroll in any additional classes, you can also be refunded for the registration fee (visiting students) or processing fee (UCLA students).

### Fees and Payment

### I submitted the registration form but did not pay the registration fee. How can I submit payment for registration?

To return to your registration and make payment of the registration fee, [access your existing registration](https://r.summer.ucla.edu/academiccourses/retrieve.cfm). You will need your five-digit registration number that was sent to your email address after submitting the registration form. If you cannot locate your registration number, please email [info@summer.ucla.edu](mailto:info@summer.ucla.edu) with your name, date of birth, and program you registered for.

Once the registration fee has been paid, you will be emailed your nine-digit University Identification (UID) number and you can begin your Summer Course enrollment on [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/).

### How much are the fees for Summer Courses?

For a fee overview and estimate, you may view our ***[Fees page](https://summer.ucla.edu/fees-payment-and-financial-aid/)***.

After enrollment, you will immediately have access to your current balance on your BruinBill account, the university’s billing system, via [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/) under the “Finances and Jobs” tab. Please note, changes in your Study List may increase your charges, therefore you should view your BruinBill after every enrollment transaction.

Be sure to review your summer account and pay by the applicable [payment deadline](http://summer.ucla.edu/calendar). You must pay your fees by the deadline to avoid having your classes dropped for nonpayment and/or a hold placed on your account.

**Please note: UCLA students who have withdrawn, been dismissed, or graduated prior to the summer term, will be assessed visiting student fees.**

### What are the per-unit fees?

UC Undergraduate student: $279 per unit  
UC Graduate student: $374 per unit  
All other students (including dismissed, withdrawn, or graduated UCLA students): $385 per unit

### What happens if I miss the payment deadline?

Students with outstanding balances may be dropped from their course(s) and/or receive a hold on their accounts. If your summer balance remains outstanding, you may also be referred to Collections.

Exceptions can only be made for individuals who will be receiving financial aid through the University of California (UC), and who are placed on the Protect from Drop list.

All other students are subject to our payment deadlines and consequences for non-payment.

### I’m a UC financial aid student. What happens if my financial aid doesn’t get disbursed by the payment deadline?

If you are a **UCLA financial aid student**, your aid will likely disburse before the payment deadline for summer. If your aid is delayed, but you have successfully submitted all required documents with your aid application, you may be placed on the **Protect from Drop list** and your courses will be saved from the drop for non-payment.

If you are a **visiting UC financial aid student**, please visit your home university’s financial aid office website. If eligible, your aid will disburse from your home UC campus directly to you. Once you receive your aid, please make full payment to UCLA through BruinBill to avoid any drops or holds on your account.

If your home UC campus financial aid office is unable to disburse your aid by the payment deadline, it is customary for your financial aid office to send UCLA a “Protect from Drop” list. **If you are still waiting for your aid to be disbursed, please check with your home UC financial aid office to see if you have been included in their protect-from-drop list.**

### Does changing the number of enrolled units affect my summer bill?

Yes. Summer tuition is calculated per unit; therefore, increasing or decreasing the number of units you are enrolled in will affect your summer balance. View your BruinBill on [***MyUCLA***](https://my.ucla.edu/) under “Finances and Jobs” after every enrollment transaction to ensure your bill accurately reflects the number of units you are enrolled in.

Check your BruinBill often and pay in full before your payment deadline to avoid any drops or holds placed on your account.

### Housing

### Is housing available for students taking summer classes on-campus?

If you are enrolled in a **Summer Course** and are *17 years of age or older* by the start of the summer term, you may apply for housing through the [UCLA Housing](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/summer-housing/summer-sessions-housing/summer-sessions-housing) application which opens in mid-May.

Note: UCLA Summer Sessions is not affiliated with and does not provide support for any non-structured housing. There will be no supervision provided for students with at-large housing contracts.

## Precollege Summer Focus Series and Summer Institutes

### General Information

### What are Precollege Summer Focus Series and Summer Institutes?

Summer Institutes provide in depth coverage of a subject area and hands-on experience in an intensive and holistic format.

UCLA has two types of institutes: Summer Precollege Focus Series and College/Professional Summer Institutes.

**Summer Precollege Focus Series**  are designed for advanced high school students who are 15 years of age or older (by the first day of the Summer Sessions term) and who want to gain an academically challenging college-level experience in a specific subject area. Areas of focus include performing arts, computer science, writing, and more.

**College/Professional Summer Institutes** are intended for college-level students or working professionals and deliver instruction beyond the traditional classroom experience. Areas of focus include film and television, architecture, media, industrial research, and more.

### Do I receive college credit?

Yes, all of our summer programs offer college credit on an official UCLA transcript upon program completion.

For visiting University of California (UC) students, all UCLA summer activity should automatically appear on your home UC campus transcript by mid-November. The grades you earn at UCLA are included in your home UC campus grade-point average (GPA).

Students outside the UC system should verify their school’s credit-granting process. Transfer of credit is at the discretion of the receiving institution.

### Where can I find the schedule and syllabus for my program?

Schedules and syllabi for [Summer Precollege Focus Series](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-precollege-focus-series/) and [College/Professional Summer Institutes](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-institutes/) will be available on the program’s page. While schedules and syllabi may not be listed well in advance if instructors are updating them for the upcoming summer, there may be samples from previous summers for reference. If not yet listed, you may email the department, the Program Coordinator, or Instructor directly to request them, if available.

### Eligibility and Application Requirements

### Do Precollege Summer Focus Series and Summer Institutes have admission requirements?

All Summer Precollege Focus Series and College/Professional Summer Institutes require students to apply. All institutes will require both a transcript and a value statement. The minimum GPA to apply is a 3.0 cumulative GPA (unweighted) from grade 9 to present.

Some institutes may have additional requirements (such as an essay, a letter of recommendation, examples of your work, etc.), all of which can be provided or uploaded during the online registration process. Please see the specific page for each [Summer Precollege Focus Series](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-precollege-focus-series/) or [College/Professional Summer Institute](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-institutes/) to review the specific requirements for each program.

If the program instructor has evaluated your application and granted admission to the program, you can enroll by submitting payment of the registration fee.

### What do I do if my school transcript does not utilize the standard 4.0 GPA scale?

If you are an international student, a transcript refers to your complete secondary academic record. To learn more about converting your grades into a US-based GPA, please click [here](https://myiee.org/gpa-calculator).

If your school has a translation/equivalency guide, please also include it with your transcript. If you do not have a translation/equivalency guide, please still submit your most up-to-date transcript as is for staff to review.

## Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP)

### General Inquiries

### What is the Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP)?

The Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP) is an immersive, 6-week long academic experience designed for exceptionally high-achieving high school students about to begin their junior or senior year. The program not only gives students the opportunity to study at UCLA during the summer alongside UCLA and other visiting college students, but provides participants with a real-world, collaborative experience like none other.

Students have access to a variety of academic resources and services to support their success at UCLA and in their future academic careers, including seminars and workshops on college-level research and writing,  college admission, as well as resilience leadership training and mindfulness components.

### How is this program different friom other UCLA Summer offerings?

SCIP is a fully-immersive college experience that lasts the duration of a regular summer session term at UCLA. Students are able to select from nearly 100 different UCLA courses approved for high school students and will attend these courses alongside UCLA and visiting undergraduate students for an authentic college experience.

Unlike summer courses, SCIP students will have exclusive access to co-curricular components designed to support students’ college academic readiness, resilience and wellness, and ability to successfully navigate college life.

### What is the difference between the three versions of the program: SCIP, SCIP+, and eSCIP?

All three versions of the program offer UCLA college credit and access to curated co-curricular workshops designed to emulate the undergraduate experience that lasts the duration of a regular UCLA summer term.

While SCIP and SCIP+ take place on the UCLA campus with in-person courses, live co-curricular activities, and the opportunity to live in the UCLA residence halls, **eSCIP is a 100% virtual program**. Students who are not able to travel to Los Angeles or with commitments such as summer jobs, sports practices, or vacations should look to eSCIP for a more flexible program.

**SCIP+** students have exclusive access to SCIP+ specific co-curricular components to teach **the foundation of research** with 1-on-1 advising and guest speakers from UCLA research labs and beyond. SCIP+ students receive one extra unit of credit for Research Practice 97XD (RES PRC 97XD) for their involvement in the research component of the program.

### Who is eligible to attend SCIP?

SCIP is exclusively intended for rising high school juniors and seniors (10th and 11th grade in Spring) with highly competitive academic credentials and GPA requirements. Please visit the program page to confirm you meet the “Program Eligibility” requirements. We invite eligible students from all around the world to apply.

**Per campus policy, only students who are 17 years or older by the start of the summer term (June 22, 2026) will be eligible to reside in the residential halls.** There are NO exceptions and students will be required to provide proof of birthday at the time of application.

## Parents and Guardians

### Program Information

### What summer programs are available for high school students?

High school students have three options to earn UCLA credit during the summer: Summer Courses, Summer Precollege Focus Series, and the Summer College Immersion Program (SCIP). We encourage parents to utilize the [High School Program Guide](https://summer.ucla.edu/app/uploads/2023/10/High-School-Program-Guide-upd-Jan.-2025.pdf) to determine which option may be best for the student.

**Summer Courses**

With over 100 Summer Courses, high school students **15 years of age or older** may enroll in one or two college courses alongside our UCLA students. Summer courses range in length from **3-10 weeks,** with the majority of offerings lasting 6-weeks.

Students may consider Summer Courses, Summer Online, or Summer Intensives for their academic experience. The list of approved summer courses  for high school students will become available online in mid-January.

**Summer Precollege Focus Series**

UCLA Summer Precollege Focus Series provide high school students the opportunity to earn college credit while advancing their skill set in one area of study. Summer Precollege Focus Series are available in a wide range of subject areas in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and STEM.

[Summer Precollege Focus Series](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-precollege-focus-series/) range in length from one to three weeks and are open to high school students who are a **minimum of** **15 years of age** by the start of the summer term. Some institutes may have older eligibility requirements.

For a complete list of Summer Institutes and individual program requirements, please visit our Summer Precollege Focus Series page.

**Summer College Immersion Program**

[The Summer College Immersion Program](https://summer.ucla.edu/summer-programs/summer-college-immersion-program/) (SCIP) combines co-curricular components, such as workshops on college admissions and seminars on leadership, with 1-2 UCLA courses, giving participants a comprehensive look into college life.

Rising high school juniors and seniors can apply for this exclusive **6-week** experience and join the next cohort of high-achieving students! Please visit the linked program page to learn more about SCIP.

### Where can I find information about tuition costs and payment deadlines?

Students, parents, and guardians may locate information about tuition and payment deadlines, and use our Fee Calculator, on our [Fees, Payment, and Financial Aid page](https://summer.ucla.edu/fees-payment-and-financial-aid/). Please note, tuition costs and deadlines will vary based on the student’s enrollment.

### Third-Party Access

### How can I access my child’s MyUCLA account?

Students can authorize a third party (e.g., a parent, a guardian, or a family member) access to view their student records. **The third-party must create their own separate MyUCLA account to set up access**, then share their UCLA Logon ID (i.e., username) with the student.

For additional information on third-party access or to view a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ggOXTypuA), visit the [UCLA Parents and Family Programs webpage](http://parents.ucla.edu/about-us/ferpa3rd-party-access). Please note, students may revoke access or change access features at any time.

### Academics, Grades, and Transcripts

### Do high school students earn college credit for their participation in UCLA Summer Sessions?

Yes, all students that successfully complete course work or a program through UCLA Summer Sessions will be awarded college credit on a UCLA transcript.

UCLA courses are generally accepted for transfer credit at most collegiate institutions; however, all decisions on transferability rest with the receiving institution. Students may conveniently order transcripts on MyUCLA. Once signed in to their account, they may select “Classes,” then “Transcripts – Official.”

Note, parents do not have automatic access to view their student’s grades. If a parent or guardian wishes to view the student’s grades, Third-Party Access must be set up on MyUCLA.

### What resources are available if my student needs academic help?

All instructors and teaching assistants (TA’s) make themselves available to meet with students during office hours. Your student may utilize office hours to get their questions answered or to discuss challenging material.  Please encourage your student to speak with the instructor or teaching assistant about their difficulty with the material.

Additionally, for writing-related concerns, visiting students also have access to the UCLA [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://uwc.ucla.edu/).

### Campus Life

### Do parents or guardians need to be present for residential housing check-in?

Parents and guardians are welcome to attend housing check-in, but are not required to be present.

### Will my student get to explore campus or the city while attending UCLA Summer Sessions?

All students are expected to participate in mandatory class time and scheduled activities. However, during hours when there are no mandatory curricular classes or activities, students may explore campus or nearby areas, with permission from appropriate residential staff.

### Student Conduct and Emergency Contact
