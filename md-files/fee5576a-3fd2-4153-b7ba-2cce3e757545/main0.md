# **Stanford Medicine Art and Anatomy Summer Program**

### **JUNE 16 - 27, 2026 JULY 7 - 18, 2026 JULY 20 - 24, 2026**

The program will include a speaker series from leading anatomists, physicians, and creatives whose work blend art and medicine. This will be followed by a week of drawing mentorship to develop a resolved final illustration. Students will present their final projects to a panel of artists, museum curators, and physicians.

At the end of this program, students will have developed skills to improve their visual, technical, and anatomical knowledge. We are looking for a mix of people in the sciences and arts - no prior drawing or anatomy experience is required.

***The Art & Anatomy Program is a 1-2 week, in-person immersion in visual storytelling.***
