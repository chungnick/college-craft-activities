## Young Scholars Summer Program in Biostatistics and Clinical Research

In collaboration with clinical researchers, biostatisticians at the Yale Center for Analytical Sciences (YCAS) design research studies and use statistical methods to address critical problems in medicine and public health. Our YCAS Young Scholars intensive summer program provides promising high school students entering 11th and 12th grade, who excel in math, with the opportunity to learn about the work of biostatisticians in an academic environment. During this summer program, we introduce students to basic statistical methods and study designs used in medical research. We also provide instruction in “R,” a computer programming language for statistical analyses. Students work in teams and use real health science data to address study questions and develop a final presentation of their work.
