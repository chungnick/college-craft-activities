# Tuition

Students at lunch in the YSPH Student Lounge.

Tuition for the 12-day Young Scholars program is $3,000.

* **By May 15** We ask that accepted students pay a $500 deposit to hold their place and confirm their participation in the program.
* **By June 16** the remaining $2,500 is due.

## Tuition covers:

* Faculty, staff, and intern effort
* Web support and outreach services
* Daily lunch, snacks, and clean-up

##

Students at lunch outside at the Medical School quad.

## How to pay

Upon an offer of admission, you will receive a payment link with further instructions for paying by credit card.

## Refunds

It may be difficult to replace a student who withdraws from the program as those on the waiting list are likely to have made other plans. Therefore, refunds can be made only in extreme cases, such as a family emergency. The tuition deposit is non-refundable.
