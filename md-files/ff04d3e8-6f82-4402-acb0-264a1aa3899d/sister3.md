The Yale Center for Analytical Sciences (YCAS) Young Scholars Program brings together a group of rising 11th and 12th grade high school students for two and a half weeks each summer. The program's goal is to expose motivated and academically promising students with strong math skills to biostatistics and health sciences research and methodologies. The program is centered on guiding students through the steps required to conduct a research study and highlights the vital role of the biostatistician in clinical research. The program emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Morning sessions include an intensive introduction to biostatistics, the opportunity to analyze research data, and the development of statistical programming skills. Midday features presentations by biostatisticians and clinical researchers from Yale’s schools of medicine and public health. These lectures expose students to a range of research studies currently underway at Yale. Students spend the afternoons learning about research methods. Throughout the program, students work in small groups focused on designing and conducting a research study and on interpreting the analyses they have conducted. The program culminates in group presentations on these student projects. Tours of Yale augment the program experience.

The curriculum is designed and taught by faculty and staff of YCAS. Alumni of the program serve as team leaders, teaching assistants and peer mentors.

With their applications, students must submit two teacher recommendations (at least one from a math teacher). We have asked students to download a copy of the recommendation form and e-mail it to you to complete. You can also [download the form](https://files-profile.medicine.yale.edu/documents/64334f38-dacd-46bc-b8d4-9d1e85395c9f "Doc: Teacher Recommendation") directly.

Please return the completed form to [paula.maher@yale.edu](mailto:paula.maher@yale.edu).

## For Students

Are you interested in learning about medical research? Do you love math? Would you like to develop computer programming skills? If you answered “yes” to these questions, consider applying to the Young Scholars summer program offered by the Yale Center for Analytical Sciences (YCAS).

As Young Scholars, you will learn about biostatistics, which is the use of statistics to answer important questions investigated by medical research. Right now, our biostatisticians are collaborating with doctors and other medical researchers (e.g., psychologists, lab scientists) to find ways to prevent elderly people from falling; to identify alternatives to opioids for managing pain; and to test new drugs to help cancer patients live longer. Our biostatisticians contribute to this work by helping to design sound studies and using appropriate statistical techniques to obtain accurate results that will lead to effective treatments and, ultimately, improve health.

During our two-week program, you will work closely with faculty, staff, graduate students and peer mentors to:

* learn basic biostatistics;
* run statistical tests using a programming language called “R”;
* learn about the design of health sciences research studies;
* work in teams, with real data from Yale studies, to answer research questions using statistics;
* prepare a group presentation of your work for family, friends, and YCAS staff.

During midday talks, you will meet biostatisticians and clinical researchers and learn about their work. You will also learn about life at Yale, through tours of the campus and immersion in its culture.

If you are interested in the Young Scholars program and are a rising 11th or 12th grade student, talk with your parents and teachers and submit your application online.

## Information for Parents

We will host an information session for accepted students and their parents prior to the start of the program. During this session, we will review health and safety information as well as the program rules and schedule.

During the Young Scholars program, the health and safety of the students is our utmost priority. Our program is registered with Yale’s Committee on Programs for Children and Youth and complies with all University policies and procedures.

On the last day of the program, the students will present their work and will receive certificates of program completion. We hope that you will join us for the festivities!

Please note that Young Scholars is an intensive program that requires a full-time commitment.
