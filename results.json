Participants must be at least 16 years of age and are held to the same high academic standards as all Yale students while earning college credit. The application process requires an online form, high school transcripts with at least 2.5 years of grades, and two letters of recommendation from teachers or counselors. Students choosing in-person study are required to live on campus in residential colleges, where they receive support from Yale undergraduate residential counselors and must adhere to specific safety regulations. While standardized test scores are optional under a test-flexible policy, applicants are encouraged to submit them to provide additional insight into their academic background."

      "description": "The High School Research Program (HSRP) is a highly competitive six-week educational initiative designed for students interested in pursuing studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Participants collaborate with Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2019s scientific and technical staff on hands-on research projects that support the Department of Energy\u2019s mission to address energy and environmental challenges. The program requires students to be at least 16 years old and have completed 11th grade, and applicants must be U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents with active health insurance. Selected students commit to a full-time schedule, participate in weekly meetings, and conclude their experience by presenting their work in a poster session or oral presentation. Mentorship and teamwork are central to the experience, as students contribute to shared research goals rather than conducting independent projects."
