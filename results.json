      "description": "The NSS Gerard K. O\u2019Neill Space Settlement Contest, sponsored by the National Space Society, challenges students to develop and submit projects focused on the creation of permanent space settlements. Participants are required to design orbital habitats that serve as generational homes rather than temporary outposts, focusing on free space environments rather than planetary surfaces. The competition accepts a wide variety of submission formats, including technical designs, original research, essays, models, and artwork. All entries must be entirely student-produced, though instructors and mentors may provide guidance on core concepts and resources. The contest enforces strict guidelines regarding academic integrity, requiring explicit citation for any AI-generated components and limiting most primary submissions to a maximum of fifty pages.",

      "description": "The College Courses For High School Students program at Fordham University is a selective initiative designed for rising high school seniors with a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0 or better. Participants enroll in one credit-bearing undergraduate course alongside current college students, with options available for both in-person and online study. The application process requires an unofficial transcript, an academic writing sample with citations, and a seventy-five dollar deposit that is credited toward enrollment upon acceptance. Students can choose from a variety of subjects including biology, chemistry, computer science, and business, and those accepted must confirm their intent to enroll through a tuition deposit. This program provides secondary students with valuable college experience and connections while earning credits that typically transfer easily to other institutions.",

Students also create a research poster to share with peers and a panel of judges during an event featuring hands-on workshops, field trips, and career development opportunities. To support their work, attendees can join an online research mentoring cohort that pairs them with graduate students to discuss research questions and ideas. Top-performing students are competitively selected as delegates to represent the state at the Global Youth Institute, where they interact with Nobel and World Food Prize Laureates.",

Students participate in an asynchronous learning environment, watching pre-recorded video lectures at their own pace while completing daily or weekly assignments on the Smashcut platform. Throughout the program, participants produce a variety of short films, including a crew-based documentary, a music video, and a final narrative film. While students must supply their own filming technology and computer equipment, they engage in real-time video meetings with instructors and film crews to foster collaboration. Upon successful completion of the workshop, students earn four college credits and receive instruction from a faculty of experienced industry professionals.",

Participants attend lectures led by medical faculty and engage in hands-on anatomy lab activities that incorporate real human anatomical specimens and cadavers. The curriculum includes surgical skills workshops where students practice dissection and suturing techniques on animal tissue, as well as opportunities to meet guest speakers from diverse clinical specialties. This non-residential program requires applicants to be at least fifteen years old and submit an application including transcripts for consideration on a rolling basis. Prospective students should be prepared for an authentic exposure to medical practice, as some instructional components involving surgical demonstrations may be emotionally challenging.",

The program aims to prepare students for the process of scientific discovery and the path toward successfully applying to PhD or MD/PhD graduate programs. Each student receives a stipend for their full-time commitment, which requires participation in lab work and academic sessions from Monday through Friday. Prospective applicants must submit a college transcript, a resume, a personal statement describing their goals and resilience, and two letters of recommendation, including one from a science faculty member.",

      "description": "The Summer High School Research Internship offers rising juniors the opportunity to work alongside a multidisciplinary team of research scientists, clinicians, and researchers within the UCLA Steve Tisch BrainSPORT Concussion Program. Interns work directly with study staff to recruit patients, enter research data, and conduct study protocols for comprehensive projects such as CARE4Kids, which investigates persistent post-concussion symptoms in adolescents through neuroimaging and cognitive assessments. Participants attend weekly Traumatic Brain Injury lab meetings with the BrainSPORT team to gain insight into the daily operations of clinical research while collaborating with medical students and other interns. The program culminates in a final project where students present on a research topic of interest based on their clinical experiences and data collection efforts. Applicants should be interested in clinical research and may have the opportunity to extend their involvement as a mentor or intern into the following academic year.",

Matches are divided into a fifteen-second autonomous period and a longer driver-controlled period where participants operate their robots manually. Teams earn points by scoring eighty-eight blocks into four goals, controlling specific zones within those goals, and parking robots in designated areas before time expires. Additional scoring incentives include a ten-point autonomous bonus and the opportunity to earn an autonomous win point through the completion of assigned tasks. This program emphasizes technical execution and strategic teamwork as students navigate a field containing both long and center goals.",

Participants can choose from approximately thirty courses across various disciplines, including engineering, computer science, social sciences, and the humanities. Residential students are required to enroll in two courses for the duration of the six-week program, while commuters living within a local radius have the option to take one or two classes. To support student success, a special grade forgiveness policy is applied, where only grades of A and B are recorded on official permanent transcripts for those in good academic standing. This rigorous academic experience prepares students for college success through authentic classroom environments and access to university faculty and support resources.",

      "description": "The Pre-College Art program at Carnegie Mellon University offers high school sophomores and juniors a rigorous introduction to college-level studio practice through three-week or six-week immersive sessions. Participants explore creative ideas using both traditional tools and cutting-edge technologies across diverse subjects such as drawing, sculpture, animation, and digital photography. A core component of the curriculum is the Concept Studio, where students develop personal, non-medium-specific approaches to artmaking through readings, collaborative projects, and individual critiques. In addition to regular coursework, students participate in elective Friday workshops and receive one-on-one portfolio reviews from faculty to prepare for the competitive college application process. The program provides a residential experience in campus residence halls or a commuter option for local students, supported by comprehensive material kits and 24-hour supervision.",
